**Letter 38**

**To the People of Egypt When He Appointed \(Malik Ibn\) al\-Ashtar as Their Governor**

From the slave of Allah, Ali Ibn Abu Talib, to the people who became wrathful for the sake of Allah when He was disobeyed on His earth and His rights were ignored and oppression had spread its coverings over the virtuous as well as the vicious, on the native as well as the foreigner\. Consequently, no good was acted upon nor any evil was avoided\.

I have sent you a man from among the servants of Allah Who allows himself no sleep in the days of danger, nor does he shrink from the enemy at critical moments\. He is more severe with the wicked than a blazing fire\. He is Malik ibn al\-Harith, our brother from \(the tribe of\) Madhhaj\. Therefore, listen to him and obey his orders that agree with what is right because he is a sword among the swords of Allah the edge of which is not dull and which does not miss its victim\. If he orders you to advance, do advance, and if he orders you to stay, do stay because he surely neither advances nor attacks nor puts anyone backward or forward save with my command\. I have preferred him for you rather than for myself because of his being your well\-wisher and \(because of\) the severity of his harshness with your enemies\.
