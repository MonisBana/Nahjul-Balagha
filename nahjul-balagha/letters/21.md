**Letter 21**

**Also to Ziyad**

Give up luxury and be moderate\. Every day, remember the coming Day \[of Judgment\]\. Hold back from the funds what you need and send forward the balance for the day of your need\.

Do you expect that Allah may give you the reward of the humble while you yourself remain vain in His view? And do you covet that He may give you the reward of those practicing charity while you enjoy means of comfort, denying them to the weak and the widows? Certainly, a man is awarded according to his deeds\. He shall meet what he has sent before, and that is the end of the matter\.
