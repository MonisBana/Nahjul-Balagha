**Letter 30**

**To Mu\`awiyah**

Fear Allah regarding what you have amassed and find out your true right turn to understand, for you will not be excused on the grounds of ignorance\. Certainly, for \(following the path of\) obedience there are clear signs, shining ways, straight highways and a fixed aim\. The shrewd proceed towards them while the mean ones turn away from them\. Whoever turns his face from them deviates from righteousness and gropes in bewilderment\. Allah takes away His bounty from him and afflicts him with His chastisement\. Therefore, beware of your own selves\. Allah has already shown you your way and the end where your affairs will terminate\. You are speeding towards the aim of loss and the status of unbelief\. Your ego has pushed you towards evil, thrown you into misguidance and conveyed you to destruction, placing obstacles in your way\.
