**Letter 1**

**Addressed to the people of Kufa at the time of his march from Medina to Basra \.**

From the servant of Allah, Ali, the Commander of the Faithful, to the people of Kufa who are the foremost among the supporters and the chiefs of the Arabs\.

I am reminding you of what happened to Othman so that its memory may be like seeing its events\. People criticized him, and I was the only man from among the Muhajirun \(immigrants\) to ask him to make it his pursuit to please \(the Muslims\) the most and to offend them the very least\. As for Talhah and az\-Zubayr, their lightest step about him was hard, and their softest voice was strong\. Aisha, too, was angry with him\. Consequently, a group overpowered him and killed him\. Then, people swore allegiance to me, not by force or compulsion, but obediently and out of their free will\.

You should know that Medina has been vacated by its residents who have abandoned it\. It is boiling like a huge cauldron and rebellion is fixed on its axis, moving with full force\. So, hasten towards your amir \(commander\) and proceed forward to fight your enemy, if Allah, to Whom Might and Majesty belong, so wills\.

Ibn Maythmam writes \(in Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 4, p\. 338\) that when on hearing about themischief\-mongering of Talhah and az\-Zubayr, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) set off for Basra\. He sent this letter

to the people of Kufa through Imam al\-Hassan and Ammar ibn Yasir from \[the town of\] al\-Maa’al\-Adhb, while ibn Abul\-Hadid has written \(in Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 14, pp\. 8, 16; al\-Tabari, Vol\. 1, p\. 3139, and ibn al\-Athir, Vol\. 3, p\. 223\) that when Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) camped at ar\-Rabadha, he sent this letter through Muhammad ibn Ja\`far

<a id="page734"></a>ibn Abu Talib and Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr\. In this letter, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) clearly sheds a light on the point that the assassination of

Othman was the result of the efforts of Aisha, Talhah and az\-Zubayr, and that it was they who played a major role in it\. In fact, Aisha went beyond her bounds and exposed his shortcomings in public meetings, ordering that he should be killed\. Thus, Shaikh Muhammad Abdo has written the following: “Once, Othman was on the pulpit when Umm al\-Mu’minin \[mother of the faithful\] Aisha took out the shoes and the shirt of the Prophet \(h\) from under her outer covering mantle and said the following:

‘These are the shoes of the Messenger of Allah and his shirt\. They have not yet decayed while you have altered his religion and changed his Sunnah\.’ Upon this, heated words were exchanged between them following which she said, ‘Kill this Na’thal’, likening Othman with a known long\-bearded Jew \(of that name\)” \(Nahjul\-Balagha, printed in Egypt, Vol\. 2, p\. 3; also see Ansab al\-Ashraf, Vol\. 5, p\. 88; Abul\-Fida’, Vol\. 1, p\. 172\)\.

People were already displeased with Othman, so this event increased their boldness\. They, hence, surrounded his mansion so that he might mend his ways or abdicate from the caliphate\. In these circumstances, there was serious apprehension that if he did not accept either of the two alternatives, he would be killed\. All this was observed by Aisha, but she paid no heed to it and, leaving him under siege, she decided to leave Medina for Mecca\. On this occasion, Marwan ibn al\-Hakam \[her cousin\] and Attab ibn As d said the following to her, “If you postpone your departure, it is possible his \[‘Othman’s\] life may be saved and this crowd \[laying siege around his mansion\] may disperse,” whereupon she said that she had decided to go for hajj and that that could not be changed\. It was then that Marwan recited this couplet by way of a proverb:

Qays set fire to my cities, and when they were ablaze, He slipped away, saving himself clear of it\.

Similarly, Talhah and az\- Zubayr were also very angry with him and they were in the vanguard of those fanning this fire, intensifying the opposition to his caliphate\. From this angle, they were, to a great extent, taking part in the assassination and were responsible for shedding his blood\. Other people also knew them in this light and regarded them as his murderers, while their supporters, too, were not able to offer any explanation \(for absolving them\)\. Thus, Ibn Qutaybah writes that when al\-Mughrah ibn Shu’bah met Aisha at Awtas, he asked her the following

<a id="page735"></a>question: “O Umm al\-Mu’minin\! Where are you bound for?” She replied, “I am going to Basra\.” He inquired for what purpose and she replied, “To avenge Othman’s murder\.” He said, “But his assassins are with you\!” Then he turned to Marwan and inquired where he was going\. He replied that he, too, was going to Basra\. He inquired about the purpose and the reply was: “To avenge Othman’s murder\.” Then he again said, “\`Othman’s assassins are with you\. These Talhah and az\-Zubayr have killed him” \(Al\-Imama wal\-Siyasa, Vol\. 1, p\. 60\)\.

In any case, when, after laying the blame on Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), this group that had killed \`Othman reached Basra, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) also rose to quell this mischief; he wrote this letter to the

people of Kufa to solicit their support\. Upon this, their combatants and warriors rose in large numbers and enlisted in his army\. They faced the enemy with full courage which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) also acknowledged\. Thus, the letter hereafter is in acknowledgment\.
