**Invocation 15**

**By Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) When He Used to Face the**

**Enemy**\.

O Lord\! Hearts are drawn to You, necks are stretching \(towards You\), eyes are fixed \(on You\), steps are in motion and bodies have turned lean\! O Lord\! Hidden animosity has become manifest and the cauldrons of malice are boiling\.

O Lord\! We complain to You of the absence of our Prophet \(h\), the numerousness of our enemy and the diffusion of our passions\.
