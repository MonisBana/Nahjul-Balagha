**Instruction 56**

**When Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Placed Shurayh Ibn Hani**

**\(al\- Madhhaji\) at the Head of the Vanguard Preceding Towards Syria, He Issued this Document of Instruction to Him**\.

Fear Allah every morning and evening and remain apprehensive about yourself with regard to this deceitful world, and do not regard it as safe in any case\. Be informed that if, for fear of some evil, you do not refrain from things which you love, passions will then fling you into a lot of harm\. Therefore, refrain for your own soul and be your own protector against your anger; suppress and kill it\.
