**Letter 52**

**To the Governors of Various Places Concerning Prayers**

Offer the zuhr \(noon\) prayers with the people when the shade of the wall of the goats’ pen is equal to the wall\. Offer the asr \(afternoon\) prayers with them when the sun is still shining in a portion of the day enough for covering the distance of two farasangs \(about six miles\)\. Offer the maghrib \(sunset\) prayers when whoever is fasting ends the fast and the pilgrim rushes \(from Arafat\) to Mina\. Offer the isha’ \(evening\) prayers with them when twilight disappears and upto one third of the night\. Say the \(early\) morning prayers with them when a man can recognize the face of his companion\. Say the prayers with the people as the weakest of them would do, and do not be a source of trouble to them\.
