**Letter 40**

**To One of His Officers**

I have come to know such a thing about you which, if you have, you have displeased your Lord, disobeyed your Imam and betrayed your trust\.

I have come to know that you have razed the ground and taken away whatever was under your feet, devouring whatever fell in your hands\. Send me your account and be admonished that accounting to Allah will be much more severe than that to the people, and that is the end of the matter\.
