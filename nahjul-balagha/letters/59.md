**Letter 59**

**To al\-Aswad ibn Qutbah, Governor of Hulwan**

If the actions of a governor follow the passions, his justice will be greatly hampered\. All people should be equal in their rights before you because injustice cannot substitute justice\. Avoid that thing the like of which you will not like for your own self\. Exert yourself in what Allah has made obligatory on you, hoping for His reward and fearing His chastisement\.

Be informed that this world is a place of trial\. Whoever here wastes any hour of his time will repent it on the Day of Judgement and nothing can ever make you too satisfied as not to need righteousness\. One of your obligations is that you should protect yourself \(from sins\) and look after the subjects your best\. The benefit that will come to you from this will be greater than that which will accrue \(to people\) through you, and that is the end of the matter\.
