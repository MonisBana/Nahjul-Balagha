**Letter 37**

**To Mu\`awiyah**

Glory to Allah\! How staunchly you cling to innovated passions and painful bewilderment along with ignoring the facts and rejecting strong reasons which are liked by Allah and serve as pleas for the people\! As regarding your prolonging the question of \`Othmanâ€™s murder213, the

213There is no question that Mu\`awiyah claimed to help Othman after the latter had been killed\. When Othman was besieged and desperately needed help, he wrote Mu\`awiyah pleading for his help, but his written plea fell upon the deaf ears of Mu\`awiyah who never budged an inch\. However, just to make a public show that he sent a contingent to Medina under the command of Yazid ibn Asad al\-Qasri, ordering it to remain waiting nearby in the valley of Dhu Khushub near Medina\. Eventually, Othman was murdered and the commander went back with his contingent, having accomplished nothing\. Undoubtedly, Mu\`awiyah wished Othman to be killed so that he could create confusion in the name of seeking revenge for the shedding of his blood\. Through such disturbances, Mu\`awiyah could clear the way for securing allegiance to himself \(as caliph\)\. This is why he neither helped Othman when he was besieged nor thought it necessary to trace the murderers of Othman after actually having secured power for himself\.

<a id="page788"></a>situation is that you helped Othman when you were really promoting your own cause, and you forsook him when he was in need of help, and that is the end of the matter\.
