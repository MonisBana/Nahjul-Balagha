**Letter 35**

**To Abdullah Ibn Abbas after Muhammad Ibn Abu Bakr Had Been Killed**

the people towards Mu\`awiyah by mentioning the greatness of his character, the sublimity of his manners and the tales of his generosity\. But when the men whom Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had put on the job informed him of all of

this, he wrote this letter to Qutham ibn al\-Abbas so that he might keep an eye on their movements and put an end to their mischief\.

<a id="page786"></a>Now then, Egypt has been conquered and Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr, may Allah have mercy on him, has been martyred\. We seek his reward from Allah\. He was a son who was a well\-wisher, a hard worker, a sharp sword and a bastion of defense\. I had called upon the people to join him and ordered them to reach him to help him prior to this incident\. I repeatedly called upon them secretly and openly\. Some of them came half\-heartedly, some put up false excuses, and some sat away leaving me behind\. I ask Allah, the Sublime One, to grant me an early relief from them, for by Allah, had I not been yearning to meet the enemy for the sake of martyrdom and not prepared myself for death, I would not have liked to be with these people for a single day, nor ever to face the enemy with them\.
