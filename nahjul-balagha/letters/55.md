**Letter 55**

**To Mu\`awiyah**

Allah, the Glorified One, has made this world for what is to come, for the Hereafter, putting its inhabitants to trial as to which of you is good in deeds\. We have not been created for this world, nor ordered to strive for it\. We have been made to stay in it to stand the trial therein\. So, Allah has tried me by you and tried you by me\. He has, therefore, made each of us a plea for the other\.

Now, you have leapt on the world by a wrong interpretation of the Holy Quran and wanted me to account for what neither my hand nor tongue was responsible, yet you and the Syrians put the blame on me and your scholar incited against me the ignorant and one who is sitting incited the one who is standing\. You should fear Allah with regard to your soul and not allow Satan to lead you\. Turn your face towards the next world because that is our path and yours\. Fear lest Allah should entangle you in any sudden affliction which may destroy the root as well as cut away the branches\. I swear to you by Allah an oath which will not be broken that if destiny brings me and you together, I shall steadfastly hold before you:

215That is to say, “You are men of riches and means, having a large tribe and community\. Why do you need this double dealing of concealing the real feelings of the heart, showing obedience and swearing allegiance loathsomely and unwillingly? Of course, if someone else who is weak and helpless said that he was obliged to swear the oath of allegiance, his point could be accepted to some extent\. But when no one else has expressed his helplessness in the matter, why did this helplessness befall you so that you now regard your swearing of allegiance to be the result of your helplessness?\!”
