**Letter 46**

**To One of his Officers**

Now, you are surely one of those whose help I accept in establishing religion and with those help I break the haughtiness of the sinful and guard critical borders\. You should seek Allahâ€™s help in whatever causes you anxiety\. Add a little harshness to the mixture of leniency and remain lenient where leniency is more appropriate\. Adopt harshness when you cannot do without harshness\. Bend your wings \(in humbleness\) before the subjects\. Meet them with your face broad and keep yourself lenient \(in behavior\) with them\. Treat them equally in looking at them with half eyes or full eyes, in signaling and in greeting so that the great should not expect transgression on your part and the weak should not lose hope in your justice, and that is the end of the matter\.
