**Letter 63**

**To Abu Musa \(\`Abdullah ibn Qays\) al\-Ash\`ari, Governor of Kufa when Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) learned that he was dissuading the people of Kufa from joining the forces to fight the battle of Jamal when Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had called them to fight along with him**:

From the servant of Allah, Ali ibn Abu Talib, to \`Abdullah ibn Qays: I have come to know of words uttered by you which go in your favor as well as against you220\. So, when my messenger reaches you,

debauchery\. It was carried off to Medina\. Still, the caliph was too slow and hesitated to enforce the punishment on his Governor \(his half brother\); giving cause to be himself reproachfully accused of ignoring the law, although at last he was persuaded to have al\-Walid whipped forty lashes\. He was consequently deposed from his office\. Sa’id ibn al\-As, a cousin of Othman was appointed to take his place, and this was a matter of a great reproach against Othman” \(_Ansab_ _al\-Ashraf_, al\-Baladhiri, Vol\. 5, pp\. 33\-35;_ Al\-Aghani_, Abul\-Faraj al\-Isfahani,\* *Vol\. 4, pp\. 174\-187; *Al\-Isti\`ab*, Vol\. 4, pp\. 1554\-1557; *Usd al\-Ghaba\*, Vol\. 5,

219The man who accepted Islam only after securing financial gain was Mu\`awiyah who did so only for worldly benefits*\.*

2201\. When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had the idea of suppressing the rebellion of the people of Basra, he sent this letter through Imam al\-Hassan \(x\) to Abu Musa \(Abdullah ibn Qays\) al\-Ash\`ari, who had been appointed Governor of Kufa by Othman\. In it, the Imam \(x\) scolds him for his duplicity and self\-

<a id="page841"></a>prepare yourself and get ready, come out of your den and call upon those who are with you\. Then, if you are convinced of the truth, get up\. But if you feel cowardly, go away\. By Allah, you will be caught wherever you may be and you will not be spared till you are completely upset and everything about you is scattered and till you are shaken from your seat\. Then, you will fear from your front as you do from the rear\.

What you hope for is not a light matter; it is a serious calamity\. We have to ride its camels, overcome its difficulties and level its mountains\. Set your mind in order, take a grip on your affairs and acquire your \(lot and your\) share\. If you do not like it, go away to where neither you are welcome nor can you escape\. It is better that you be left alone and lie sleeping\. Then no one will inquire where is so\-and\-so\. By Allah, this is the case of right with the rightful person, and we do not care what the heretics do, and that is the end of the matter\.
