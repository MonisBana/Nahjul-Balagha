**Letter 19**

**To One of His Officers**

Now, the cultivators207

\[dahaqin, plural of dihqan\] of your city have complained of your strictness, hard\- heartedness, humiliating treatment and harshness\. I thought it over and found that since they are unbelievers, they cannot be brought near nor kept away nor treated severely because of the pledge with them\. Behave with them in\-between strictness and softness, and adopt for them a mingling or remoteness, aloofness with nearness, if Allah so pleases\.
