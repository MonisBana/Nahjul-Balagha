**To One of the Officers of His Army**

If they204 return to the umbrella of obedience, then this is all that we want\. But if the condition of these people points out towards disruption and disobedience, then, taking with you those who obey you, you must rush against those who disobey you\. While you have those with you who follow you, do not worry about those who hold back from you because the absence of a half\-hearted man is better than his presence, and his sitting down is better than his rising\.

coast of present\-day Yemen\. Thus, they were probably aided in the overthrow of their Sabaean \[or Sabian\] kinsmen by the discovery of a sea route from Egypt to India which deprived the inland Sabaean kingdom of its former importance as a center for offshore trade\. The Himyarites \(classical Homeritae\) inherited the Sabaean language and culture and from their capital at Zafar, their power at times extended eastward as far as the Persian Gulf and northward into the Arabian Desert\. At the beginning of the 4th century AD, the Himyarite capital was moved northward to San’a\. Later in the same century, both Christianity and Judaism gained firm footholds in the area\. Internal disorders and changing trade routes caused the kingdom to decline\. In 525 AD, after several unsuccessful attempts, Abyssinian invaders finally crushed the Himyarites\. A Himyar appeal to Peria for aid led to Persian control in 575 AD\. \(_The New Encyclopedia_ _Britannica _\[Micropaedia\] Vol\. 5, p\. 49, ed\. 1973\-1974\)\.

204When \`Othman ibn Hunayf, Governor of Basra, informed Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) of the arrival of Talhah and az\-Zubayr at Basra and of their

intentions, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) wrote this letter to him\. In it, he

instructed him that in case the enemy was bent on fighting and he had to face it, he should not enlist on his side those who on the one hand showed consideration for the personalities of \`\}’isha, Talhah and az\-Zubayr and who, on the other hand, had agreed to fight against them merely by persuasion because such people could not be expected to fight steadfastly nor could then be depended

**To al\-Ash\`ath ibn Qays \(al\-Kindi\), Governor of Azerbaijan**

Certainly, your assignment is not a morsel for you, but it is a trust round your neck, and you have been charged with the protection \(of the people\) on behalf of your superiors\. It is not for you to be oppressive towards the subjects, nor to put your life at risk save on strong grounds\. You have in your hands the funds which are the property of Allah to Whom belong Might and Majesty, and you hold its charge till you pass it on to me\. Probably I will not be one of the bad rulers for you, and this is the end of the matter\.

When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) was through with the Battle of

Jamal, he wrote to al\-Ash\`ath ibn Qays \(al\-Kindi\), who had been the Governor of Azerbaijan since the days of Othman, to send the revenue and levies of his province to him \[in Kufa\]\. But since al\-Ash’ath had fears about the future of his status and assignment, he intended to pocket all this money like other officers appointed by Othman\. Therefore, as soon as this letter reached him, he sent for his chief associates\. Having mentioned this letter to them, he said the following: “I fear that this money will be taken away from me; I, therefore, intend to join Mu\`awiyah\.” It was then that those people said that it was a matter of shame to leave the kith and kin and to seek refuge with Mu\`awiyah\. Consequently, on the advice of those people, he postponed the implementation of his idea to run away, but he did not agree to part with the money\. On getting this information, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) sent Hijr ibn Adiy al\-Kindi to bring the man

to him to Kufa\. He persuaded him and brought him to Kufa\. On reaching there, his kit was found to contain four hundred thousand Dirhams out of which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) left thirty thousand for the man and deposited the rest in the public treasury\.
