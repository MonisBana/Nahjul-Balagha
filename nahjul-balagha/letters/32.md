**Letter 32**

**To Mu\`awiyah**

You have ruined a large group of people whom you have deceived by your misguidance and have flung them into the currents of your sea where darkness covers them and misgivings toss them about\. As a result, they have strayed from the right path and turned on their backs\. They turned their backs and pushed forward except those wise ones who came back, leaving you behind, having come to understand you very well\. They ran towards Allah away from assisting you when you put them to troubles and caused them to deviate from themiddle path\. Therefore, O Mu\`awiyah, fear Allah about yourself and take your rein away from Satan since this world is shortly to be cut off from you and the next world is near you, and that is the end of the matter\.
