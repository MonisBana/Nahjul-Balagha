**Letter 61**

**To Kumayl ibn Ziyad an\-Nakh\`i, Governor of Hit, Expressing Displeasure with His Inability to Prevent the Enemy Forces That Passed Through His Area from Marauding**

The negligence by a man of what he has been made responsible for, and the doing of what is to be done by others, is a manifest weakness and a ruinous sight\. Certainly, your advance on the people of Qarqisiya and your abandonment of the forces over which we had appointed you, without anyone to protect them or to repulse the enemy force, are signs of a shattered mentality\. In this way, you served like a bridge for the enemy who came marauding on your allies while your arms were weak\. You had no force around you\. You could not prevent the enemy from advancing\. You could not break its might\. You could not defend the people of your area and you could not carry out functions on behalf of your Imam\.
