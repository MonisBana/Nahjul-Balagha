**Letter 50**

**To the Officers of His Army**

From the servant of Allah, Ali ibn Abu Talib, to the Officer\-in\-charge of garrisons:

It is obligatory on an officer that the distinction which he achieves, or the wealth with which he has been exclusively endowed, should not make him change his behavior towards those under him, and that the riches which Allah has bestowed on him should increase him in nearness to his people and kindness to his brethren\.

<a id="page815"></a>Beware that it is obligatory on me that I should not keep anything secret from you except during war time, nor should I decide any matter without consulting you except with regard to the commands of the creed, nor should I ignore the fulfillment of any of your rights, nor should I desist till I discharge it fully, and that for me all of you should be equal in rights\. Once I have done all this, it becomes obligatory on you to thank Allah for this bounty and to obey me, and you should not hold back when called upon, nor should you jeopardize your good deeds\. You should face hardships for the sake of what is right\. If you do not remain steadfast in this, there will be no one more humiliated in my view than the one among you who has deviated, then I will increase his penalty wherein no one will get any concession from me\. Take this \(pledge\) from your \(subordinate\) officers and accord to them such behavior from your side by which Allah may improve your matters, and that is the end of the matter\.
