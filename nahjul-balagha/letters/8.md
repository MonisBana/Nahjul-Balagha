**Letter 8**

**To Jarir Ibn Abdillah Al\-bajali When Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Sent Him to Mu\`awiyah \(And There Was a Delay in His Return\)**

When you receive this letter of mine, you must ask Mu\`awiyah to take a final decision and to follow a determined course\. Then ask him to choose either war that exiles him from home or a dishonorable peace\. If he chooses war, leave him alone, but if he chooses peace, secure an oath of allegiance from him, and that is an end to the matter**\.**

<a id="page741"></a>**Letter 9**

**To Mu\`awiyah**

Our people \(the tribesmen of Quraish\) decided to kill our Prophet \(h\) and to uproot us\. They caused us many worries, behaved with us

harshly, denied us the ease of life, exposed us to fear, forced us to seek refuge in a rugged mountain and ignited for us the flames of war\.

Allah then gave us determination to protect His religion and defend His honor\. The believers among us expected \(heavenly\) rewards from so doing, and the unbelievers among us gave their support because of kinship\. Those who accepted Islam from among the tribesmen of Quraish were away from the distresses in which we were involved either because of a pledge that protected them or because of the tribe that would rise to support them\. They were, therefore, safe from being killed\. The way with the Prophet \(h\) was that when fighting became fierce and

people began to lose ground, he would send forward members of his family and through them protect his companions from the attacks with swords and spears\. In this way, \`Ubaydah ibn al\-Harith was killed on the Day of Badr, Hamzah \(ibn \`Abdul\-Muttalib\) on the Day of Uhud, and Ja\`far \(ibn Abu Talib\) on the Day of Mu’tah\. One more person, whom I can name if I wish, desired to seek martyrdom as they did, but their deaths approached, while his had not\.

How strange it is that I am being grouped with him who never had a briskness of pace like mine, nor had he, to his credit, any achievement like mine unless he claims something of which I do not know\. In any case, all praise belongs to Allah\.

As regarding your request to hand over to you the murderers of Othman, I have contemplated over this matter and I do not find that handing them over to you or to someone else is possible for me\. By my life, if you do not give up your wrong ways and disruptive deeds, you would surely know them\. They would shortly be seeking you and would not give you the trouble of seeking them on land, sea, mountains or plains\. But this search would be painful for you and their visit would not give you happiness\. Peace be on those whoever deserves it\.

When the Messenger of Allah \(k\) was commanded \(by Allah\) to

call people to \(believe in\) the Unity of Allah, the powers of unbelief and disobedience stood up to block the way of truthfulness and the tribes of

<a id="page742"></a>Quraish decided to quell this voice through coercion and force\. Love for their idols was so strong in the hearts of these unbelievers, they were not prepared to hear a single word against them\. The idea of one God was enough to rouse their passions\. In addition, they were made to hear such epithets about their gods that gave them no better status than lifeless stones\. When they realized that their principles and beliefs were in jeopardy, they prepared themselves to trouble the Prophet \(h\)\. They got

ready to try every means to reach that end\. They adopted such pain\-inflicting devices \(against the Prophet \[h\]\) that it was impossible for him

to step out of his house\. Those who had accepted Islam during this period, too, had to face continuous tribulations\. For example, these adherents to such beliefs were often placed on the burning ground, under the parching sun, and beaten with straps and stones till they lost their consciousness\. When the atrocities of the tribesmen of Quraish rose to this extent, the Prophet \(h\) permitted such adherents to leave Mecca and immigrate to

Abyssinia in the fifth year since his call to Prophethood\. The tribesmen of Quraish followed them there as well, but the ruler of Abyssinia refused to hand the believers over to them\. Through his fairness and justice, he did not permit any trouble to befall them\.

On the other side of the sea, the Prophet’s preaching continued\. The magnetism and influence of truth was producing its effect\. People were impressed by his teachings and personality\. They came into his fold as a result of which the tribesmen of Quraish felt much perturbed, so they tried to stop this increasing influence and power\. When they could not do anything, they decided to sever all ties with Banu Hashim and BanÅ Abdul\-Muttalib, to have no social contacts with them, and to have no transactions with them, perhaps they would be forced to give up supporting the Prophet \(h\), then they would deal with him as they

pleased\. Consequently, they concluded a mutual agreement about it, and a document was written on the subject and was deposited safely\. After this agreement, although the locality was the same and the inhabitants, too, were the same, yet for Banu Hashim every nook and corner became strange and well\-known faces turned as if they had never known each other\. All of them turned their faces and stopped mutual meetings and contacts\. In these circumstances, there was also the apprehension that the Prophet \(h\) might be attacked suddenly in a valley outside the city\. For

this reason, they were forced to take refuge in a place called Shi’b \(quarter\) of Abu Talib\. At this stage, those Banu Hashim who had not yet accepted Islam shared these privations on account of lineal kinship and offered defence at the hour of need, while those who had accepted Islam,

<a id="page743"></a>such as Hamzah and Abu Talib, were actively protecting the Prophet \(h\) as their religious obligation\. In particular, Abu Talib had given up all his ease and comfort, spending his days consoling the Prophet \(h\) and his nights changing his bed from one place to another\. Thus, if the Prophet \(h\) used a bed one night, the next night Ali was to sleep in it, so that in case someone attacked, Ali should suffer the brunt instead\.

This was a period of great privation and trouble for Banu Hashim\. If they could get leaves of trees to eat, that was enough for them; otherwise, they had to near their starvation\. After the lapse of three years in these hardships, Zuhayr ibn Abu Umayyah \(whose mother was ‘Atika daughter of Abdul\-Muttalib\), Hisham ibn Amr ibn Rabi\`ah \(who had a family maternal kinship with Banu Hashim\), al\-Mut’im ibn \`Adiy ibn Nawfal ibn Abd Manaf, Abul\-Bakhtari al\-As ibn Hisham ibn al \-Mughirah and Zama’ah ibn al\- Aswad ibn al\-Muttalib proposed that this agreement should be abrogated\. For a discussion of this issue, the chiefs from among the tribesmen of Quraish assembled in the precincts of the Ka\`ba\. No decision had yet been taken when Abu Talib came out of the Valley and joined them\. He said to them, “My nephew Muhammad \(h\) has told me

that the paper on which this agreement was written has been eaten by white\-ants and nothing in it has remained save the name of Allah\. So, you should send for the document and see it\. If he is correct, then you should give up your animosity, and if he is wrong, I am ready to hand him over to you\.” The document was brought and examined\. It was, indeed, a fact that with the exception of the words “In Your name, O God”, written on the top of all documents in those days, the rest of it had been eaten away by white\- ants\. Seeing this, al\-Mut’im ibn \`Adiy tore off the writing; thus, this cruel agreement was abrogated\. At last, Banu Hashim abandoned the life of oppression and helplessness\. But even after this, there was no change in the unbelievers’ behavior towards the Prophet \(h\)\. Rather,

they were so keen in their enmity and malice against him that they started thinking of taking his life away\. Consequently, the great event of Hijra \(migration of the Holy Prophet \[h\] from Mecca to Medina\) took place\.

Although on this occasion Abu Talib was no longer alive, Ali represented him by lying down on the Prophet’s bed; it was the lesson taught by Abu Talib through which he managed to protect the Holy Prophet’s life\.

Although these events were not unknown to Mu\`awiyah, yet by recounting to him the deeds of his predecessors, the intention was to awaken his malicious spirit\. Therefore, his attention has been drawn to the hardships inflicted \(on the Holy Prophet \[h\] and his adherents\) by the

<a id="page744"></a>tribesmen of Quraish, especially Banu Abd Shams, so that he might see the conduct of each of the followers of the truth and the followers of falsehood would then realize that he himself was treading on the right path or just following his forefathers\.
