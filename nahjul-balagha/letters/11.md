**Instruction 11**

**Given to the Contingent Sent to Confront an Enemy**

When you proceed towards your enemy, the status of your force should be on the approaches of high grounds or edges of mountains or bends of rivers, so that it may serve you as a place to return to\. Your encounter should be from one side or from two\. Position scouts on the

<a id="page746"></a>peaks of mountains and the raised sides of the high ground so that the enemy may not approach you from any place, whether of danger or of safety\. And be admonished that the vanguard of an army serves as their eyes and the eyes of the vanguard are their informers\. Beware of dispersal\. When you halt, do so collectively, and when you move, you should move together\. When night comes, fix your spears in a circle and do not sleep except for dosing or napping\.

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) put Ziyad ibn an\-Nadr al\-Harithi and

Shurayh ibn Hani al\-Harithi in command of contingents of eight thousand and four thousand strong at the camp of an\-Nukhayla, ordering them to advance towards Syria\. A dispute arose then between them about their ranks\. They informed Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) of it and wrote letters

of complaints about each other\. In reply, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

wrote to them that when they marched jointly, the command of the joint force would be with Ziyad ibn an \-Nadr al\-Harithi, and if they marched separately, each commander would be in charge of his own force\.

In this letter, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) also wrote certain

instructions for them\. Here, Sayyid ar\-Radi takes down only the portion containing the instructions\. These instructions are not only useful as regards the strategies of fighting in those days, but their utilization and importance in bringing out the principles of fighting in our days as well is undeniable\. These instructions are: At the time of encounter with the enemy forces, the assailants should camp on tops of mountains and curves of rivers\. This way, the low areas of the rivers would serve as trenches and the peaks of mountains as the walls of the fortress; thus, it would be possible to feel secure and face the enemy from the other side\. Secondly, the attack should be from one side or at the most from two because by distributing the entire force on several fronts, weakness would be inevitable\. Thirdly, the scouts should be placed on the tops of high grounds and the peaks of mountains so that they may give a warning of any attack\. Sometimes, it happens that instead of attacking from the expected side, the enemy attacks from a different one\. Therefore, if posses are on high places, they will detect the enemy from the cloud of dust seen from a distance\.

To clarify the useful aspect of these instructions, Ibn Abul\-Hadid has recorded \(in Vol\. 15, p\. 91\) a historical incident that when Qahtabah \(ibn Shabib at\-Ta’i\) camped in a village after leaving Khurasan, he and Khalid ibn Barmak went and sat on the top of a nearby hill\. No sooner had they sat down than Khalid noticed flocks of deer coming running

<a id="page747"></a>from the forest\. On seeing this he said to Qahtabah, “O Commander\! Stand and announce to the army that they should at once fall in line and take up arms\.” Hearing this, Qahtabah was startled\. He stood up\. Looking hither and thither, he said, “I do not see the enemy’s men anywhere\.” He replied, “O Amir\! This is not the time that should be lost in any conversation\. You have seen how these deer are proceeding towards the people, leaving their abodes\. This means that the enemy’s army is marching from the rear\.” Consequently, the commander ordered his army to get ready\. As soon as the army got ready, the noise of the horses’ hoofs was heard and within moments the enemy was on them\. Since they had prepared themselves for defence in time, they defended themselves against the enemy thoroughly\. Now, if Khalid had not been at such a height and had not acted with such sagacity, the enemy would have attacked them as they were unaware of the attack and annihilated them\. Fourthly, the reconnaissance should be spread here and there, so that they can be aware of the movements and intentions of the enemy and thereby foil his plans\. Fifthly, when the army camps, it should camp together, and when it moves, it should move together, so that the enemy does not attack you in a state of dispersal and overpowers you easily\. Sixthly, at night, the guard should be formed by fixing spears in a circle in the ground so that if the enemy attacks during the night, it is possible to prepare for defense by taking up arms at once, and if the enemy showers arrows, that, too, can be dealt with\. Seventhly, deep sleep should be avoided lest you should become unaware of the enemy’s approach and the latter would succeed in attacking you before you get ready\.
