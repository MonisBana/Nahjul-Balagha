**Letter 17**

**In Reply to a Letter from Mu\`awiyah\.**

As for your demand to me to \(hand over\) Syria, I cannot give you today what I denied you the day before\. As regarding your statement that the war has eaten up Arabia save its last breath, you should know that those whose right has been eaten up will go to Paradise, whereas those who are wrong shall go to Hell\. As for your equality in war and in \(the numbers of\) men, certainly you cannot be more penetrating in doubtfulness \(of belief\) than I am in certainty \(of belief\), and the people of Syria are not more greedy for this world than the people of Iraq are for the next one\.

As for your saying that both of us are sons of Abd Manaf, it is undoubtedly so, but Umayyah cannot be like Hashim, nor can Harb be like \`Abdul\- Muttalib, nor can Abu Sufyan be like Abu Talib\. The muhajir \(immigrant\) cannot be a match for whoever was set free \(when Mecca fell\), nor can one of a pure descent be a match for one who is adopted, nor the pursuer of truth can be a match to the adherent to wrongdoing, nor can a believer be a match for a hypocrite\.\.\. How bad are the successors who

<a id="page753"></a>go on following their predecessors who have already fallen into the fire of Hell\!

Besides, we also have the distinction of Prophethood among us by virtue of which we subdued the strong and raised up the downtrodden\. When Allah made Arabia enter \(the fold of\) His religion and when the \[Arab\] people submitted to it willingly or unwillingly, you were among those who entered the religion either out of greed or out of fear, at a time when those who had gone first had preceded and when the first Muhajirun had acquired their own distinction\.

Now, do not give Satan have a share in you, nor should you let him have his sway over you, and that is an end of the matter\.

During the battle of Siffin, Mu\`awiyah again considered demanding the province of Syria from Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and

playing such a trick in order to succeed in his schemes\. In this regard, he consulted Amr ibn al\-As\. But the latter did not agree with this idea and said, “O Mu\`awiyah, think a little\! What effect would this writing of yours have on Ali? How can he fall in this trap by your persuasion?” To this, Mu\`awiyah said, “We are all descendants of \`Abd Manaf\. What difference is there between Ali and me that he may score over me and I may not succeed in deceiving him?” \`Amr ibn al\-As said, “If you think so, then write and see \(the outcome\)\.”

Mu\`awiyah, therefore, wrote a letter to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) wherein he made a demand for Syria and also wrote the following: “We are descendants of Abd Manaf\. There is no distinction for one over the other among us\.” Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) wrote this letter in

reply\. He mentioned his own predecessors along with those of Mu\`awiyah, expressing his rejection of the claim of such an equality\. Although the origin of both was the same, and although the paternal chain of both joined at \`Abd Manaf, the progeny of \`Abd Shams was the source of all evil when it came to morality and character, involving itself in heresy and vice\. Contrariwise, the house of Hashim was the one where Allah was worshiped as the only god and where there were no idols\. If the branches growing out of the same root bear both flowers as well as thorns, then both cannot be deemed as equal\. Consequently, it does not need any detailed explanation to argue that Umayyah and Hashim, Harb and Abdul\-Muttalib, and Abu Sufyan and Abu Talib did not match each other from any angle whatever\. This is not denied by any historian or biographer\. In fact, after this reply, even Mu\`awiyah did not dare to refute

<a id="page754"></a>it: After Abd Manaf, it was Hashim alone who possessed conspicuous prestige among the tribesmen of Quraish and the most important positions with relationship to the Ka\`ba, namely the siqaya \(i\.e\. providing water for the pilgrims\) and rifada \(making provisions for the pilgrims\) was assigned to him\. As such, during the time of hajj, one caravan after another used to come and stay with him\. He was such a generous host to them that those who partook of his generosity and benevolence praised him for a long time thereafter\.

The worthy son of this very large \-hearted and courageous father was Abdul\-Muttalib whose name was Shaybah and surname was “Sayyidul\-Batha” \(master of the Mecca Valley\)\. He was the successor to the distinction of Abraham’s line and owner of the greatness and mastership of Quraish\. The high courage and far\-sightedness demonstrated by him before Abraham is a shining star for the family of Abd Manaf\. Abd Manaf was a pearl and Abdul\-Muttalib was the luster of the pearl\.

Abdul\-Muttalib’s son was Abu Talib whose lap served as the cradle for Abdullah’s orphan child and as the place where the Prophet \(h\) was raised\. He raised the Prophet \(h\) in his care, shielding him

against his enemies\. To compare Abu Sufyan, Harb and Umayyah with them or to regard them as their matches is the same as to close one’s eyes to the luster of light and to regard it as darkness\.

After recounting this genealogical difference, the next point of distinction which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) describes is that he himself is a muhajir \(immigrant from Mecca\) while Mu\`awiyah is a taliq \(i\.e\. one of those whose lives the Prophet \[h\] had spared when Mecca fell to the Muslims\)\. Therefore, when the Prophet \(h\) entered Mecca victoriously,

he inquired from the tribesmen of Quraish as to how they thought he would deal with them\. All said that, being a generous son of a generous father, they expected only goodness from him, whereupon the Prophet \(h\) said, “Go away, you have all been spared\.” That is, “You did deserve

to be detained as slaves but, by obligation, you have been set free\.” These spared persons included Mu\`awiyah and Abu Sufyan\. Thus, Ibn Abul\-Hadid and Shaikh Muhammad Abdo have recorded the following note in their annotations to this letter: “Abu Sufyan and Mu\`awiyah were both among the spared ones” \(Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 17, p\. 119; \`Abdoh, Vol\. 3, p\. 17\)\.

<a id="page755"></a>The third point of distinction is that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s lineage is pure and clear and there is no doubtful point anywhere in it\. Contrariwise, Mu\`awiyah has used to the word “taliq”\. Men of letters have given “taliq” this meaning: “One who is attributed to someone who is not his father”\. In this regard, the first doubt entertained about Umayyah is whether he was the son of Abd Shams or simply his slave who began to be known as his son because of having been brought up by him\. Thus, allama al\- Majlisi has related the following from Kamil al\-Bahai: “Umayyah was a Byzantine slave of \`Abd Shams\. When the latter found him intelligent and sagacious, he freed him then adopted him as his son\. The result was that he began to be called ‘Umayyah son of \`Abd Shams’ as Zayd \(ibn Harithah\) was called ‘Zayd ibn Muhammad \(h\)’

before a Quranic verse was revealed \(prohibiting it\)\.”

The second doubt in the Umayyad lineage is whether Harb, who is known as the son of Umayyah, was really his son or simply a slave brought up by him\. In this regard, Ibn Abul\- Hadid has quoted the following from Abul\-Faraj al\-Isbahani’s bookt: “Mu\`awiyah inquired from the lineage expert Daghfal \(Ibn Hanzalah\) whether he had seen Abdul\-Muttalib\. The genealogist replied in the affirmative\. He further inquired how he found him, whereupon Daghfal replied, “He was prestigious, handsome and a man of a broad forehead, while his face bore the brightness of Prophethood\. Then, Mu\`awiyah inquired whether he had seen Umayyah ibn Abd Shams also and he replied that he had seen him, too\. He inquired how he found him, so he replied, “Weak of body, bent stature and blind\.” In front of him was his slave Thakwan who led his life here and there\. Mu\`awiyah said it was his son Abu Amr \(Harb\), whereupon he said, “You say so but the tribesmen of Quraish only know that he was his slave” \(Al\-Aghani, Vol\. 1, p\. 12; Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 17, pp\. 231\-232\)\.

In this regard, the third doubt is about Mu\`awiyah himself\. Thus, Ibn Abul\-Hadid has written that: “Mu\`awiyah’s mother, Hind, led a life of vileness and immorality\.” Az\-Zamakhshari \(Abul\-Qasim Mahmud ibn Umar \[467/1075 \- 538/1144\]\) has written in his book Rabi’ al\-Abrar that Mu\`awiyah’s parentage was traced back to four persons who were: Musafir ibn Abu Amr, Omerah ibn al\-Walid ibn al\-Mughirah, al\-Abbas ibn Abdul\-Muttalib and as\-Sabah \(a singer for Omerah\)” \(Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 1, p\. 336\)\.

The fourth point of distinction is that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has stated that he was always the devotee of what is right while

<a id="page756"></a>Mu\`awiyah was the devotee of wrongdoing\. This fact needs no proof\. The life of Mu\`awiyah was spent in suppressing right and hankering after wrong\. Nowhere is his step seen as advancing the cause of righteousness\.

The fifth distinction is that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) was a

believer whereas Mu\`awiyah was a mischief\- monger and a hypocrite\. Just as there can be no doubt about Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s belief, there can be no doubt about Mu\`awiyah’s mischief\-mongering and hypocricy\. Thus, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has exposed the man’s hypocrisy in the earlier writing of these words\.

These people had not accepted Islam but only secured safety by verbally professing it and had hidden their disbelief\. Consequently, when they found helpers for their mischief, they disclosed it\.
