**Letter 6**

**To Mu\`awiyah \(ibn Abu Sufyan\)**

Verily, those who swore allegiance to Abu Bakr, Umar and Othman have sworn allegiance to me on the same basis on which they swore allegiance to them\. Whoever was present had no choice \(to

upon\. Rather, such people will try to discourage others, too\. Therefore, it was only good to ignore such people\.

<a id="page739"></a>consider\), and whoever was absent had no right to reject, and consultation was confined to the Muhajirun and the Ansar\. If they agree on an individual and take him to be the Caliph, it will be deemed to imply seeking Allah’s pleasure\. If anyone keeps away by way of demonstrating his objection or for innovation, they will return him to the status from where he kept away\. If he refuses, they will fight him for following a course other than that of the believers, and Allah will put him back from where he had run away\. By my life, O Mu\`awiyah, if you see with your brain without any passion, you will find me the most innocent of all with regard to Othman’s blood, and you will surely know that I was in seclusion from him, unless you conceal what is quite open to you\. Then you may commit an outrage \(on me\) as you like, and that is the end of the matter\.

When all the people of Medina swore allegiance to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), Mu\`awiyah refused to go along, fearing his own power

being jeopardized and to contest Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s caliphate\. He concocted the excuse that it had not been agreed upon unanimously and that, therefore, after canceling it, there should be another general election, although the caliphate from which \(the process of\) election was started was the result of a timely situation\. There was no question about the common vote so it could be called the result of the people’s election\. Rather, it was imposed on the people and assumed to be their verdict\. From then, it became a principle that whoever the nobles of Medna elected will be deemed to represent the entire world of Islam; nobody would be allowed to question it, whether he was present at the time of election or not\. In any case, after the establishment of this principle, Mu\`awiyah had no right to propose a re \-election nor to refuse the swearing of allegiance when he had in practice recognized these caliphates which, it was alleged, had been settled by the important people of Medina\. That is why when he alleged this election was unbinding, refusing to swear allegiance, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) pointed out to

him the \(recognized\) way of election and smashed his argument\. It was a method known as arguing with the adversary on the basis of his wrong premises so as to refute his argument, since Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

never at any stage regarded consultation \(with the chiefs\) or the common vote to be the criterion of validity of the caliphate\. Otherwise, with regard to the caliphate, about which it is alleged that they were based on the unanimity of the Muhajirun and the Ansar, he would have regarded that unanimity of vote as a sound authority, holding it as valid\. But his refusal of the swearing of allegiance in the very first period, which could not be denied by anyone, is a proof of the fact that he did not regard these self\-

<a id="page740"></a>concocted methods as the criterion of \(validity of\) the caliphate\. That is why at all times he continued pressing his own case for the caliphate, which was also established on the basis of the Prophet’s statements and actions\. However, to place it before Mu\`awiyah meant opening the door to questions and answers\. He, therefore, attempted to convince him of his own premises and beliefs so that there could be no scope for interpretation nor for confusing the matter\. In fact, the real objective of Mu\`awiyah was to prolong the matter so that at some point his own authority might gain some support\.
