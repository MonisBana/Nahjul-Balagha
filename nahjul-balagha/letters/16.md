**Instruction 16**

**He Used to Issue this Instruction to His Followers During Battle Time\.**

The retreat after which return is intended and the withdrawal after which an attack is in view should not make you unhappy\. Do justice with the swords \(allow your swords to do their duties\)\. Keep ready a place for the falling of bodies \(of your foe\); prepare yourselves for hurling strong spears and striking swords with full force, and keep your voices down as doing so keeps cowardice off\.

By the One Who broke open the seed \(for growth\) and created living beings, they had not accepted Islam but had only secured safety \(by verbally professing it\), hiding their lack of faith\. Consequently, when they found helpers for their lack of faith, they disclosed it\.
