**To Mundhir ibn Jarud al\-Abdi Who, in His Administrative Charge, Had Misappropriated Certain Things:**

The good behavior of your father deceived me about you, and I thought that you would follow his way and tread on his path\. But according to what has reached me about you, you are not giving up following your own inclinations and are not retaining any provision for the next world\. You are making this world by ruining your next life and doing good to your kinsmen by cutting yourself off from religion\.

If what has reached me about you is correct, then the camel of your family and the strap of your shoe are better than your own self\. A man with qualities like yours is not fit to close a hole in the ground, nor for performing any deed, nor for increasing his status, nor for taking him as a partner in any trust, nor for trusting him against misappropriation\. Therefore, proceed to me as soon as this letter reaches you if Allah so wills\.

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “Mundhir ibn Jarud al\-Abdi is

the one about whom Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said the following: ‘He

looks very often at his own shoulders, feeling proud of his garments \(appearance\) and usually blowing away \(dust\) from his shoes\.’”

**To Abdullah ibn Abbas**:

You cannot go farther than the limit of your life, nor can you be given a livelihood which is not for you\. Remember that this life consists of two days: a day for you and a day against you, and that the world is a house \(changing\) authorities\. Whatever in it is for you and would come to you despite your weakness, and if anything in it turns against you, it cannot be brought back despite your strength\.
