**To the People of Egypt Sent Through Malik al\-Ashtar When He Was Made Governor**

Allah, the Glorified One, deputed Muhammad \(h\) as a warner for all the worlds and a witness for all the prophets\. When the Prophet \(h\) expired, the Muslims quarrelled about power after him\. By Allah, it never occurred to me and I never imagined that after the Prophet \(h\) the Arabs would snatch away the caliphate from his Ahlul\-Bayt \(x\), nor that

<a id="page838"></a>they would take it away from me after him, but I suddenly noticed how people surrounded the man to swear the oath of allegiance to him\.216

I, therefore, withheld my hand till I saw that many people were reverting from Islam and trying to destroy the religion of Muhammad \(h\)\. I then feared that if I did not protect Islam and its people, and if

there occurred in it a breach or destruction, it would mean a greater blow to me than the loss of power over you which was, in any case, to last for a few days of which everything would pass away as the mirage passes away, or as the cloud scuds away\. Therefore, in these eventualities, I rose till wrong was destroyed and disappeared and religion attained peace and safety\.

216The Prophet’s declarations about Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) such

as: “This is my brother, my vicegerent and my caliph among you,” and while returning from his farewell hajj at Ghadir Khum, that “For whosoever I am the master, Ali is his master” had already settled the issue of the Prophet’s replacement and succession\. Besides them, there was no further need at all for any new “election”, nor could it be imagined that the people of Medna would feel the need for an “election” after Allah had already elected a man to succeed His Prophet \(k\)\. But some power\-hungry individuals ignored these clear

injunctions as if their ears had never been acquainted with them and considered the election so necessary that, forgetting completely about performing the burial rites for the Prophet \(h\), they assembled at the _saqifa_ of Banu Sa\`idah and “elected” Abu Bakr as caliph without the slightest show of a democratic process\. This was a very critical moment for Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\. On one hand,

some interested individuals declared that he should take up arms and, on the other hand, he noticed that those Arabs who had accepted Islam by dint of its military might were leaving it and Musaylimah ibn Thumamah al\-Hanafi, the Liar \(al\- Kaththab\), and Tulayhah ibn Khuwaylid al\-Asadi \(the Liar\) were throwing tribe after tribe into misguidance\. In these circumstances, had there been a civil war and Muslims had fought against Muslims, the forces of heresy and hypocrisy would have joined together and swept Islam off the surface of the earth\. Therefore, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) preferred to keep quiet rather than

to fight and, with the purpose of maintaining the solidarity of Islam, confined himself to peacefully protesting rather than taking up arms\. This was because formal power was not so dear to him as the good and prosperity of the community\. For stopping the machinations of the hypocrites and defeating the aims of the mischief mongers, there was no other course but that he should not fan the flames of war by giving up his own claim\. This was such a big deed for the preservation of Islamic policy that it is acknowledged by all the sects of Islam\.

<a id="page839"></a>**An excerpt from the same letter:**

By Allah, if I had encountered them alone and they had been so numerous as to fill earth to the brim, I will not have worried or become perplexed\. I am clear in myself and possess conviction from Allah about their misguidance and my guidance\. I am hopeful and expectant that I will meet Allah and get His good reward\. But I am worried that foolish and wicked people will control the affairs of the entire community\. The result: They will grab the funds of Allah as their own property and make His people slaves,217 fight with the virtuous and ally with the sinful\. Indeed, there is among them whoever drank \(wine\) unlawfully218 and was

2172\. This refers to the saying of the Holy Prophet \(h\) about the

children of Umayyah and the children of Abul\-As ibn Umayyah \(grandfather of Othman ibn Affan and ancestor of the dynasty of Marwan’s caliphs\), as related by Abu Dharr al\-Ghifari, that the Holy Prophet \(h\) said the following: “When

the number of Banu Umayyah reaches forty men, they will make Allah’s people their slaves, grab Allah’s funds as their own property and render the Book of Allah a cause of corruption” \(_Al\-Mustadrak_, Vol\. 4, p\. 479; _Kanz al\-Ummal_, Vol\. 11, p\. 149\)\. About the children of Abul\-As it is related by Abu Dharr, Abu Sa’id al\-Khudri, Ibn Abbas, Abu Hurayra and others that the Holy Prophet \(h\)

said the following: “When the number of Banu Abul\-As reaches thirty men, they will grab the funds of Allah as their own property, make Allah’s people their slaves and render the religion of Allah a cause of corruption” \(_Al\-Musnad_, Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Vol\. 3, p\. 80; _Al\-Mustadrak_, al\-Hakim, Vol\. 4, p\. 480; _Al\-Matalib al\-Aliyah_, Ibn Hajar, Vol\. 4, p\. 332;_ Majma’az\-Zawa’id_, al\-Haythami,\* *Vol\. 5, pp\. 241, 243; *Kanz al\-Ummal\*, al\-Muttaqi al\-Hindi, Vol\. 11, pp\. 148, 149, 351, 354\)\. The history of Islam \(after the death of the Holy Prophet \[h\]\)

contains sufficient testimony to prove this prediction of the Holy Prophet \(h\)\. The fear of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) for the Muslim community was based

on it\.

2183\. The man who drank wine was al\-Walid ibn Uqbah ibn Abu Mu’ayt\. He was born by the same mother as that of caliph Othman and of his Governor of Kufa\. Al\-Walid, on an occasion, in a state of intoxication, led the morning prayers in the central mosque of Kufa with four _raka’at_ instead of the usual two as prescribed by the Holy Prophet \(h\)\. The congregation, which

consisted of several pious persons like ibn Mas\`Åd, was outraged and felt further irritated when, finishing the four _raka’at_, al\-Walid said the following: “What a pleasant morning?\! I would like to extend the prayers\. Furthermore, if you consent, repeated complaints had already been made to the caliph against al\-Walid on account of his debauchery, but as often dismissed\.” People now reproached Othman for not listening to their grievances and favoring such a scoundrel\. By chance, they succeeded in taking off the signet ring from the hand of the Governor as he lay unconscious from the effects of an act of his

<a id="page840"></a>whipped by way of punishment fixed by Islam and there is whoever did not accept Islam till he had secured financial gain through it\.219 If this had not been so, I would not have emphasized gathering you, reprimanding you, mobilizing you and urging you \(for jihad\), but if you refuse and show weakness, I will leave you\.

Do you not see that the boundaries of your cities have diminished, your populated areas have been conquered, your possessions have been snatched away and your cities and lands have been assaulted? May Allah have mercy on you, get up to fight your enemy and do not remain confined to the ground; otherwise, you will face oppression and suffer ignominy and your fate will be the worst\. The warrior should be wakeful because if he sleeps, the enemy does not sleep, and that is the end of the matter\.
