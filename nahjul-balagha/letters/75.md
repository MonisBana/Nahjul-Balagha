**To Mu\`awiyah, Soon after Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Was**

**Sworn In\. \(Muhammad Ibn Umar\) al\-Waqidi Has Mentioned this**

**Letter in His Book Kitab al\-Jamal**:

From the servant of Allah, Ali, Ibn Abu Talib, to Mu\`awiyah son of Abu Sufyan: You are aware of my excuses before you, people, and my shunning you till that happened which was inevitable and which could not be prevented\. The story is long and much is to be said\. What was to pass has passed and what was to come has come\. Therefore, secure \(my\) allegiance from those who are with you and come in a deputation of your people to me, and that is the end of the matter\.
