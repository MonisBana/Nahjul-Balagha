**To Mu\`awiyah**

Now is the time221 that you should benefit by observing a clear view of the main matters because you have been treading in the path of

221At the end of the battle of the Kharijites, Mu\`awiyah wrote a letter to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) wherein he, as usual, indulged in mud\-slinging\. In

reply, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) wrote this letter in which he has tried to draw

Mu\`awiyah’s attention to the clear facts about this very battle of the Kharijites because this battle took place in accordance with the prediction of the Prophet \(h\) while Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) himself had said before the battle that

besides the people of Jamal and Siffin, he had to fight against one more group and they were the “deviators” from the religion, namely the Kharijites\. The

<a id="page845"></a>your forefathers of making wrong claims, spreading false and untrue notions, claiming for yourself what is far above you and demanding what is not meant for you: You want to run away from what is right and to rebellion against what is more fastened to your flesh and blood, namely what has been heard by the depth of your ears and has filled your chest\. After forsaking right, nothing remains except clear misguidance, and after disregarding a \(clear\) statement, there is nothing left but confusion\. You should, therefore, guard \(yourself\) against doubts and the ill\-effects of confusion because for a long time, mischief has spread its veils and its gloom has blinded your eyes\.

I have received your letter which is full of uncouth utterances: They weaken the cause of peace\. It also is full of nonsensical expressions which have not been prepared with knowledge and forbearance\. By reason of these things, you have become like one who is sinking in a marshy land or groping in a dark place\. You have raised yourself to a status which is difficult to approach and is devoid of any signs \(of guidance\)\. Even the royal kite cannot reach it\. It is parallel to the Ayyuq \(the star Capella\), in loftiness\.

May Allah forbid that you should be in charge of people’s affairs after my assuming authority as caliph, or that I should issue an edict or document granting you authority over any of them\. Therefore, from now on, you should guard yourself and be watchful because if you recalcitrate till the people of Allah \(are forced to\) rush upon you, then matters will be

occurrence of this battle and the killing of the man with breasts \(Dhul\-Thudayya\) was a clear proof of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) being on the right

track\. If Mu\`awiyah had not been obsessed with self\-praise and lust for conquests, and had he not shut his eyes against what is right, as was the case with his forefather, Abun Sufyan, and his brother, Utbah, he would have seen right and joined its tracks\. But compelled by his natural inclinations, he always evaded what is right and shunned the truth, keeping himself blind to those sayings of the Prophet \(h\) which threw light on Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s

Imamate and vicegerency\. Because of being with the Prophet \(h\) in the

farewell pilgrimage, the Prophet’s saying: “Of whomsoever I am the master, Ali is his master” was not hidden from him\. Neither was the Prophet’s saying that: “O Ali\! You are to me as Harun was to Musa” because of his presence during the battle of Tabuk\. In spite of all this, Mu\`awiyah spent all his life concealing right and encouraging wrong\. This was not due to any misunderstanding; rather, it was his own lust for power\. This is what kept him busy prompting himself through means of suppression, trampling on the truth and violating justice, and thus do some people behave\.
