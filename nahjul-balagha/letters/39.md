**Letter 39**

**To Amr ibn al\-As**

You have surely made your religion subservient to the worldly pursuits of a man whose misguidance is not a concealed matter and whose veil has been torn away\. He mars an honorable man with his company and makes fools of those around him\. You are following in his footsteps and seeking his favors like the dog that follows the lion looking at its paws and waiting for whatever remains of his prey that will fall down to it\. In this way, you have ruined your world as well as the next\. Had you stuck to the right, you would have gotten what you were seeking\. If Allah grants me power over you and over the son of Abu Sufyan \(Mu\`awiyah\), I

<a id="page789"></a>shall award you both the recompense of what you have done, but if you escape and survive, then there is only evil for you both, and that is the end of the matter\.
