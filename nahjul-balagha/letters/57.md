**Letter 57**

**To the People of Kufa When He Marched from Medina to**

**Basra**

I have come out of my city either as an oppressor or as an oppressed person, either as a rebel or as the one against whom rebellion has been committed\. In any case, whomsoever this letter of mine reaches, I appeal to him in the name of Allah that he should come to me, and if I am in the right, he should help me; but if I am wrong, then he should try to get me to the right according to his view\.
