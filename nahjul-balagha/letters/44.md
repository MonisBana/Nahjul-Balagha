**To Ziyad Ibn Abih When Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Came**

**to Know That Mu\`awiyah Had Written to Ziyad to Deceive Him and to Attach Him to Himself in Kinship**

I have learned that Mu\`awiyah has written to you to deceive your wit and blunt your sharpness\. You should be on guard against him because he is the Satan who approaches a believer from the front and from the back, from the right and from the left, to catch him suddenly in the hour of his carelessness and to overcome his intelligence\.

During the days of \`Umar ibn al\-Khattab, Abu Sufyan happened to utter a thoughtless point which was an evil insinuation of Satan from which neither kinship is established nor entitlement to succession occurs\. Whoever relies on it is like the uninvited guest to a drinking party or like the dangling cup \(tied to a saddle\)\.

Sayyid ar\- Radi says the following: “When Ziyad read the letter, he said, ‘By Allah he has testified to it’\. This point remained in his mind till Mu\`awiyah claimed him \(to be his brother from his father’s side\)\.”

<a id="page792"></a>Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s word “al\-waghil” means the man who joins the drinking group so as to drink with them, but he is not one of them\. He is, therefore, constantly turned out and pushed away\. As for the words “an\- nawtul\-mudhabdhab”, it is a wooden cup or a bowl, or the like, attached to the saddle of the rider so that it dangles when the rider drives the beast or it hastens its pace\.

Umar ibn al\-Khattab sent Ziyad to Yemen for some encounter\. When he returned, having finished his mission, he addressed a gathering which included Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), Umar, Amr ibn al\-As and

Abu Sufyan\. Impressed with the speech, Amr ibn al \-As said the following: “What a good man\! Had he been from the tribesmen of Quraish, he would have led all of Arabia with his stick,” whereupon Abu Sufyan said, “He is from the tribesmen of Quraish since I know who his father is\.” Amr ibn al\-As inquired, “Who was his father?” Abu Sufyan said, “It is I\.” History also conclusively holds that Ziyad’s mother, Sumayya, who was a slave\-maid of al\-Harith ibn Kaldah and was married to a slave named Ubayd, used to lead an immoral life in a quarter of at\-Ta’if known as Haratul\-Baghaya \(quarter of the prostitutes\) and immoral men used to visit her\. Once Abu Sufyan also slept with her through the mediation of Abu Maryam as\-Saluli\. As a result, Ziyad was born\. When Amr ibn al\-As heard this from Abu Sufyan, he asked why he had not declared it publicly\. Abu Sufyan pointed to \`Umar \[ibn al\-Khattab\] and said that he was afraid of him; otherwise, he would have declared him as his own son\. Although he would not have dared to do this, when Mu\`awiyah acquired power, he started correspondence with him because Mu\`awiyah was in need of such persons who were intelligent and cunning and expert in scheming\. In any case, when Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

got information about this correspondence, he wrote this letter to Ziyad wherein he warned him against Mu\`awiyah so that he should not fall in the trap\. But he did fall in his trap anyway and joined Mu\`awiyah; the latter declared him as his brother by attributing him to his kinsfolk although the Prophet \(h\) had declared, “The child goes to the lawful husband while the adulterer gets stoned\.”
