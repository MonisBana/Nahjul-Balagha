**To Abdullah ibn Abbas, his Governor over Basra**

You should know that Basra is the place where Satan descends and mischief takes place\. Keep the people of this place pleased with good treatment and remove the knots of fear from their hearts\.

I have come to know of your strictness and harshness with Banu Tamim206\. Banu Tamim are such that if one star sets, another rises for them\. They were never exceeded in \(the art of\) war in pre\-Islamic times or after Islam\. They have a special kinship with us and a particular

206When Talhah and az\-Zubayr reached Basra, it was Banu Tamim who took active part in the movement to “avenge Othman’s blood” and were in the vanguard of those who were fanning this mischief\. Therefore, when \`Abdullah ibn Abbas took over as the Governor of Basra, in view of their breach of faith and animosity, he thought they deserved to be treated harshly and was to some extent severe with them\. But in this tribe there were also a few sincere followers of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\. When they saw this behavior of Ibn Abbas with

their tribe, they sent a letter to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) through Jariyah ibn Qadamah wherein they complained of Ibn Abbas’s harsh treatment\. Thereupon, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) wrote this letter to Ibn Abbas in which he instructed

him to change his ways and to treat them well, drawing his attention to the kinship between Banu Hashim and Banu Tamim\. That kinship was this: Banu Hashim and Banu Tamim join the lineal line at Ilyas ibn Mudar because Hashim is the descendant of Mudrikah ibn Ilyas, while Tamim is the descendant of Tabikhah ibn Ilyas\.

<a id="page757"></a>relationship\. We shall be rewarded if we pay heed to the tie of kinship and be deemed sinful if we disregard it\. O Abul\-Abbas\! May Allah have mercy on you\! Keep yourself restrained in whatever you say or do, in anything good or bad relevant to your people, as we are both partners in this \(responsibility\)\. Prove yourself according to my good impressions about you, and do not prove my opinion \(about you\) to be wrong, and this is the end of the matter\.
