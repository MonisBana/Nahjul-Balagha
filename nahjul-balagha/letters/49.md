**Letter 49**

**To Mu\`awiyah**

This world turns away from the next\. Whoever is devoted to it achieves nothing from it except that it increases his greed and coveting\. Whoever is devoted to it is not satisfied with what he gets from it because of what he has not had\. Eventually, there will be a separation from what has been amassed and a breaking of what has been strengthened\. If you learn a lesson from the past, you can be safe in the future, and that is the end of the matter\.
