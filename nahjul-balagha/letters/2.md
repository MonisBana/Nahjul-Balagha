**Letter 2**

**Written to the People of Kufa after the Victory in Basra**

May Allah reward you, townsmen \(of Kufa\), on behalf of a member of your Prophetâ€™s family, with the best reward that He bestows on those who act in obedience to Him and on those who thank Him for His bounties\. Surely, you heard \(me\) and obeyed, and when you were called upon, you promptly responded\.
