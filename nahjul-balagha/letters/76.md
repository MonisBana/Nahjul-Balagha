**Given to Abdullah ibn Abbas at the time of his appointment at his Governor of Basra**:

Meet people with a broad smile, allow them free audience and pass generous orders\. Avoid anger because it is the augury of Satan\. Remember that whatever takes you near Allah takes you away from the Fire \(of Hell\) and whatever takes you away from Allah takes you near the Fire\.
