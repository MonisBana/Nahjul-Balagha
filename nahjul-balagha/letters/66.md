**Letter 66**

**To Abdullah ibn Abbas**

**\(A different version of this letter has already been included\)**

Sometimes a person feels joyful about a thing which he was not to miss in any case and feels grieved for a thing which was not to come to him at all\. You, therefore, should not regard the attainment of pleasure and the satisfaction of the desire for revenge as the best favor in this world; rather, the putting off of the \(flame of\) wrong and the revival of right should be so\. Your pleasure should be for what \(good deeds\) you have sent forward; our grief for having lost you should be for what you are leaving behind, and your worry should be about what is to befall after death\.
