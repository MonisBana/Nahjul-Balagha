**To the Army Before the Encounter with the Enemy at Siffin**

Do not fight them unless they start the fighting because, by the grace of Allah, you are right, and to leave them till they begin fighting will be another point from your side against them\. If, by the will of Allah, the enemy is defeated, do not kill those who flee away, do not strike a helpless person, do not finish off the wounded and do not inflict pain on women even though they may attack your honor with filthy words and abuse your officers because they are weak in character, mind and intelligence\. We have been ordered to avoid them although they may be unbelievers\. Even in pre \-Islamic \(jahiliyya\) period, if a man struck a woman with a stone or a stick, he was rebuked along with his posterity after him\.\.

The responsibility for the war and fighting that took place between Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and Mu\`awiyah lies solely on Mu\`awiyah because the latter brought about the war by laying the blame for Othman’s blood on Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) erroneously, although

the facts about the causes of Othman’s killing and by whom he was killed were not unknown to Mu\`awiyah\. But since there was no way for him to achieve his objective save by creating an excuse for war, he started the war in order to retain his illegitimate authority\. This evidently was offensive\. It cannot by any means be considered as permissible because rebellion and rebellion against the rightful Imam is unlawful according to the general consensus of Muslims\. Thus, “Abu Zakariyya” Yahya ibn Sharaf an\-Nawawi \(631/1233 \- 676/1277\) writes the following: “Do not fight those in authority with regard to matters of governing, nor should you raise objections against them except when you observe them committing things which you know are definitely against Islam\. If you see them doing such things, regard it as bad for them and speak the truth wherever you may be\. But rising against them or fighting them is prohibited by the consensus of Muslims \(Sharh Sahih Muslim, Vol\. 2, p\. 125\)\. In agreement with this view, see also: judge Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn at\-Tayyib al\-Baqillani \[338/950 \- 403/1013\], the Ash\`arite great scholar, in Al\-Tamhid, p\. 186, and Sa\`d ad\-Din Mas\`ud ibn Umar at\-Taftazani \[712/1312 \- 793/1390\] in Sharh al\-Maqasid, Vol\. 2, p\. 272\.

Muhammad ibn \`Abdul\-Karm al\-Shahristani writes the following: “Whoever rises against the true Imam, according the unanimous view of the \(Muslim\) community, is known as a Kharijite,

<a id="page750"></a>deviator\. The same is the case of rising, during the days of the companions, against the rightful imams, or even after them against those who followed them in virtue \(Al\-Milal wal Nihal, Vol\. 1, p\. 114\)\.

There is no doubt that the action of Mu\`awiyah’s was the result of his rebellion\. To take up arms for the purpose of stopping the advance of the one who rebellions is not against any code of peace or against the conduct of peace \-loving people\. Rather, it is a natural right of the oppressed\. And if one is deprived of this right, then there will remain no way to prevent oppression and tyranny or the safeguarding of rights in the world\. This is why Allah has permitted taking up arms against rebels\. Thus, Allah says the following: “And if two parties of the believers fall into a quarrel, restore peace between them both; but if one of the two transgresses against the other, \(then\) fight that which transgresses till it complies with the command of Allah\. And if it complies, restore peace between the two with justice and deal justly; verily, Allah loves the just ones” \(Holy Quran, 49: 9\)\.

It was the first plea to which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) pointed

out by saying, “By the Grace of Allah, you are right\.” But even after exhausting this plea, he prevented his army from taking the initiative to fight because he wished that the initiative should not be from his side and that he should take up the sword only in self\-defense\. Consequently, when all his effort for peace proved futile, and when the enemy took the first step towards war, this was the second argument in their own favor after which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) could not be blamed for getting

fighting nor be accused of taking an aggressive action\. It was rather an obligation to stop oppression and tyranny that he had to discharge and which Allah has permitted in clear words\. Thus, Allah’s command is that: “Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you but do not be aggressive for verily Allah does not love the aggressors” \(Holy Quran, 2: 190\)\.

Besides, fighting Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) meant fighting the Prophet \(h\) according to the Prophet’s saying: “O Ali\! Your peace is my

peace and your war is my war \(Ibn al \-Maghazlii, Al\-Manaqib, p\. 5; Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 18, p\. 24\)\. Thus, whatever punishment should be imposed for fighting the Prophet \(h\) should be for fighting Imam Ali ibn

Abu Talib \(x\)\. For him, whoever wages war against the Prophet \(h\), Allah has laid down the same penalty\.

<a id="page751"></a>To recompense those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive in the land, spreading mischief \(therein\), is only that they be slain or crucified or their hands and feet should be cut off from opposite sides or be banished from the land; This for them shall be the disgrace in this world and for them, in the hereafter, shall be a great torment\. \(Holy Quran, 5: 33\)

Apart from this, the instructions that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

issued with regard to the war, namely that no runner\- away nor the wounded should be assaulted, are so high from the moral point of view that they can be regarded as a sublime specimen of the moral values and high standards of the struggle to promote Islam\. These instructions, then, were not simply confined to mere words\. Rather, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) followed them to the letter, ordering others, too, to follow them

strictly\. He did not, on any occasion, tolerate the chasing of any runner\-away, the attack against the helpless or to assault women\. In fact, on the battlefield of the Jamal war, where the command of the opposite force was in the hands of a woman, he did not change his principle\. After the defeat and the conquering of the foe, he proved his high character, sending Aisha to Medina under due protection\. Had there been someone other than Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), he would have proposed the same

punishment as that which ought to be awarded for making such a step\! Thus, Ibn Abul\-Hadid has written the following: “Had she \[Aisha\] done the same to \(caliph\) Umar as she had done to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\),

spreading rebellion against him among the people, and having the caliph secured victory over her, he would have killed her and cut her into pieces\. But Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) was very forbearing and large\-hearted” \(Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 17, p\. 254\)\.
