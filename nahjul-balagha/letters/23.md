**Made Shortly Before His Death When He Had Been Fatally Wounded by a Blow from the Sword of \(\`Abd Ar\-rahman\) Ibn Muljim \(The Curse of Allah Be Upon Him\)\.**

<a id="page759"></a>I enjoin you, as my dying wish, not to regard anything as a partner with Allah, not to disregard the Sunnah of Muhammad \(h\)\.

Establish these two pillars and light these two lamps\. You will then be free from evil\. Yesterday, I was your companion\. Today, I am \(just\) a lesson for you, while tomorrow I shall be leaving you\. If I survive, I shall be the master of my blood \(to avenge or not to avenge it\), and if I die, then death is a promised event\. If I forgive, it is for me a means of nearness \(to Allah\) and for you a good deed\. Therefore, do forgive\. “What?\! Do not you love that Allah should forgive you?” \(Holy Quran, 24: 22\)\.

By Allah\! This sudden death is not an event that I dislike, nor is it an accident that I hate\. I am just like a night traveller who reaches the spring \(in the morning\), or like or seeker who secures \(his aim\): “And whatever is with Allah is the best for the righteous” \(Holy Quran, 3: 198\)\.

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “A portion of this statement has already appeared in the sermons, but I found it necessary to record it again because of some additional matter\.”
