**Letter 64**

**Replying to Mu\`awiyah**\.

Certainly, we and you were on amicable terms, as you mentioned, but differences arose between us and your own self the other day when we accepted belief \(iman\)while you rejected it\. Today, the status is that we are steadfast \(in our belief\) but you are creating mischief\. Those of you who accepted Islam did so reluctantly and that, too, took place when all the chief men had accepted Islam and joined the Messenger of Allah \(may Allah bless him and his descendants\)\.

contradictory behavior\. He also attempted to persuade him to carry out _jihad_ because on one hand, he used to say that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) was the

true Imam and allegiance to him was right while, on the other, he said that to support him in fighting against the Muslims was not right, that it was a mischief and it was necessary to keep off this mischief\. Thus, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

has referred to this contradictory view with the words “huwa laka wa’alayka” \(which go in your favor as well as against you\)\. The intention is that when Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) is the rightful Imam, how can fighting his enemy in his

own company be wrong? And if fighting on his side is wrong, then what is the meaning of saying that he is the rightful Imam? In any case, in spite of his reluctance to fight, the people of Kufa came out in large numbers to join Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s army and fully participated in the battle, giving such a defeat to the people of Basra that the latter never again dared to rebellion thereafter*\.*

<a id="page842"></a>You have stated that I killed Talhah and az\- Zubayr, forced Aisha out of her house and adopted residence between the two cities \(Kufa and Basra\)\. These matters are none of your concern, nor do they involve anything against you\. Therefore, no explanation about them is due to you\.

You also state that you are coming to me with a party of Muhajirun and Ansar, but hijra came to an end on the day your brother was taken prisoner\. If you are in a hurry, then wait a bit as I may come to meet you and that will be more befitting as it will mean that Allah has appointed me to punish you\. But if you come to me, it will be just as the poet of Banu Asad said: “They are advancing against summer winds which are hurling stones on them in the highlands and in the lowlands\.”

\(Remember that\) I still have the sword with which I dispatched your grandfather, mother’s brother and brother to one and the same place \(Hell\)\. By Allah, I know what you are\! Your heart is sheathed and your intelligence is weak\. It is better to say that you have ascended to where you view a bad scene which is against you, not in your favor, because you are searching a thing lost by someone else, you are tending someone else’s cattle and you are hankering after a thing which is not yours nor have you any attachment to it\. How remote your words are from your actions, and how closely you resemble your paternal and maternal uncles who were led by their wickedness and love for wrong to oppose Muhammad \(h\), consequently, they were killed as you know\. They

could not put up a defense against the calamity and could not protect their “safe haven” from the striking of swords which abound in the battle and which do not show weakness\.

You have said a lot about the killing of Othman\. You must first join what the people have joined \(i\.e\. allegiance\) then seek a verdict about \(the accused people\) from me and I shall settle the matter between you and them according to the Book of Allah, the Sublime\. But what you are aiming at is just the fake nipple given to a child in the first days of weaning\. Peace be on those who deserve it\.

Mu\`awiyah had written a letter to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) in

which he, having recalled mutual unity and amicability, laid on him the blame of killing Talhah and az\-Zubayr and getting Aisha out of her house with the objective to adopt Kufa as his seat of government in place of Medina\. In the end, he made a threat of war, saying that he was about to come out with a force of Muhajirun and Ansar to fight\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) wrote this letter in reply to him wherein he commented about

<a id="page843"></a>Mu\`awiyah’s claim for unity\. He meant to say the following: “There might have been unity between you and us, but with the advent of Islam, such a huge gap has developed between both of us that it is not possible to bridge it and such a separation has occurred which cannot be rejoined\. The reason for all of this is that we responded to the call of the Prophet \(h\) and hastened towards Islam while you were still an unbeliever and

living in ignorance, hence, we and you came to adopt separate ways\. But when Islam secured stability and the chief of Arabs entered its fold, you, too, felt obliged to do so \[with the threat of otherwise losing your life\]\. You secured protection of your lives by pretending to accept Islam, but you continued secretly to fan the mischief intended to shatter Islam’s foundations\. Since we had accepted Islam of our own free will and pleasure, we adhered to the right path\. At no stage did any faltering occur in our steadfastness\. Therefore, your acceptance of Islam could not make us agree with your views\.”

As regarding Mu\`awiyah’s accusation that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) engineered the killing of Talhah and az\-Zubayr, even if this blame is admitted as true, is it not a fact that they had both openly revolted against Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and had risen for war after

breaking their oath of allegiance to him? Therefore, if they were killed with regard to their rebellion, their blood would be wasted, and no blame would lie on the killer because the penalty for whoever rebellions against the rightful Imam is death and fighting against him is permissible, without any doubt\. The fact, however, is that this accusation is baseless because Talhah was killed by a man from his own party\. Thus, the historians write: Marwan ibn al\-Hakam shot Talhah with an arrow and, turning to Aban ibn Othman, said the following: “We have killed a killer of your father and relieved you of revenge” \(Ibn Sa\`d, Vol\. 3, part 1, p\. 159; Ibn Al\-Athir Vol\. 3, p\. 244; Al \-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 2, pp\. 766\-769; Usd al\-Ghaba, Vol\. 3, pp\. 60, 61; Al\-Isaba, Vol\. 2, p\. 230; Tahthib al\-Tahthib, Vol\. 5, p\. 21\)\.

As for az\-Zubayr, he was killed by Amr ibn Jurmuz as he was on his way back from Basra and there was no hand of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) in it\. Similarly, Aisha herself came out of her house as the head

of this rebellious group while Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) advised her

several times to realize her status and not to step out of her bounds, but these suggestions had no effect on her\.

<a id="page844"></a>Of the same note was his criticism that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) left Medina and adopted Kufa as the seat of his government because

Medina turned out bad people and threw away dirt\. The reply to this is only that Mu\`awiyah himself always retained Damascus as his capital, always staying away from Medina\.

In this way, what right can he have to object to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) changing his seat of government? Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

left Medina because of those rebellions which had cropped up from all directions\. In order to suppress them, only the selection of such a place as a capital, from where military assistance could be mobilized at any time, could be useful\. Thus, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had seen on the

occasion of the Battle of Jamal that a great majority of the people of Kufa had supported him\. By making it a base for the army, the defense of the Imam \(x\) against the enemy could be easily managed, while Medina was not appropriate for military mobilization, supplies or reinforcements\.

Finally, as for Mu\`awiyah’s threat that he will march with the Muhajirun and the Ansar, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) replied to this point

in a very subtle way: “How will you bring the Muhajirun now since the door for hijra was closed when your brother, Yazid ibn Abu Sufyan, was taken prisoner?” This man was taken prisoner on the day of the fall of Mecca\. There is no question of hijra after the fall of Mecca so as to enable anyone to be called a muhajir because of the Prophet’s saying: “There is no hijra after the victory over Mecca\.”
