**Letter 22**

**To Abdullah ibn Abbas\. Abdullah ibn Abbas used to say, “Apart from the Prophet’s statements, I did not derive a greater benefit from any other statement\.”**

Let it be known to you that sometimes a man gets pleased with securing a thing which he was not going to miss at all and gets displeased at missing a thing which he would not in any case get\. Your pleasure should be about what you secure with regard to your next life, and our grief for having lost you should be for what you miss in respect thereof\. Do not be very much pleased with what you secure from this world, nor should you get extremely grieved over what you miss of it\. Your worry should be about what is to come after death\.
