**Letter 13**

**To Two Officers in His Army**

1. have placed Malik1 ibn al\-Harith al\-Ashtar in command over you and over all those under you\. Therefore, follow his commands and take him as the armour and shield for yourselves because he is one of those from whom I have no fear of weakness nor any mistake, nor laziness where haste is more appropriate,nor haste where slackness is expected of him\.

When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) sent a vanguard contingent of

twelve thousand strong under the command of Ziyad ibn an\-Nadr al\-Harithi and Shurayh ibn Hani al\-Harithi to Syria, on the way, near Sur ar\-Rum, they encountered “Abul\-Awar” Amr ibn Sulayman al\-Salami who was camping there with a Syrian contingent\. Both of them informed Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) of this through al\-Harith ibn Jumhan al\-Ju’fi,

whereupon the Imam \(x\) sent Malik ibn al\-Harith al\-Ashtar as the Officer\-in\-Command and wrote this letter to notify them\. The brief but comprehensive words in which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) refers to

Malik al \-Ashtar in this letter gives an indication of his intelligence, sagacity, courage, daring, expanse and versatility in the art of war as well as his own personal greatness\.
