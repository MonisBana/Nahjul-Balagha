**Letter 60**

**To the Officers Through Whose Jurisdictions the Army**

**Passes**

From the servant of Allah, Ali ibn Abu Talib, to all the collectors of revenue and officers of the realm through whose area the army passes\.

I have sent an army that will pass by you, if Allah so wills\. I have instructed them about what Allah has made obligatory on them, namely

<a id="page837"></a>that they should avoid assault and shun harm\. I hold myself clear before you and those \(unbelievers\) who are under your protection from any annoyance committed by the army except when one is compelled by hunger and there is no other way to satisfy it\. If anyone of them takes anything by force, you should punish him\. None of you should be foolish enough to obstruct them or intervene in matters which we have allowed them by way of exception\. I myself am within the army\. So, refer to me their high\- handedness and any hardship which is caused by them and which you cannot avert except through Allah and through myself\. I shall then avert it with the help of Allah, if He so wills\.
