**Letter 7**

**To Mu\`awiyah**

I have received from you the packet of unconnected pieces of advice and an embellished letter\. You have written it because of your misguidance and dispatched it because of your lack of wisdom\. This is the letter of a man who has neither light to show him the way nor a leader to guide him on the right path\. Passion prompted him and he responded to it\. Misguidance led him and he followed it\. Consequently, he began to speak nonsense and went recklessly astray\.

**An Excerpt from the Same Letter:**

Because allegiance is once and for all, it is not open for reconsideration, nor is there any scope for fresh proceedings of an election\. Whoever remains out of it is deemed to be critical of Islam, while whoever remains argumentative about it is a hypocrite\.
