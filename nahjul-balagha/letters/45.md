**Letter 45**

**To Othman Ibn Hunayf al\-Ansari Who Was Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib’s Governor of Basra When He Came to Know That the People of Basra Had Invited Othman to a Banquet which He Attended**

<a id="page793"></a>O son of Hunayf\! I have come to know that a young man of Basra invited you to a feast and you leapt towards it\. Foods of different colors were being chosen for you and big bowls were being given to you\. I never thought that you would accept the feast of a people who turn the beggars out while inviting the rich\. Look at the morsels which you take\. Leave out that about which you are in doubt and take that about which you are sure that it has been secured lawfully\.

Remember that every follower has a leader whom he follows, and from the glory of whose knowledge he derives light\. Realize that your Imam is satisfied with two shabby pieces of cloth out of the \(comforts of the\) world and two loaves for his meal\. Certainly, you cannot do so, but at least support me in piety, exertion, chastity and uprightness because, by Allah, I have not treasured any gold out of your world nor amassed plentiful wealth nor collected any clothes other than these two shabby sheets\.

Of course, all that we had in our possession under this sky was Fadak, but a group of people felt greedy for it, and the other party withheld themselves from it\. Allah is, after all, the best arbiter\. What shall I do? Fadak or no Fadak, tomorrow this body is to go into the grave in the darkness of which it will be destroyed and \(even\) news of it will disappear\. It is a pit that, even if its width is widened or the hands of the digger make it broad and open, the stones and clods of clay will narrow it and the falling earth will close its opening\. I try to keep myself engaged in piety so that on the Day of Great Fear it will be peaceful and steady in slippery places\.

Had I wished, I could have taken the way leading to \(worldly pleasures like\) pure honey, fine wheat and silk clothes, but it cannot be that my passions lead me and greed takes me to choosing good meals while in the Hijaz or in Yamama there may be people who have no hope of getting bread or who do not have a full meal\. Shall I lie down with a satiated belly while around me there may be hungry bellies and thirsty livers? Or shall I be as the poet has said:

It is enough for you to have a disease that you lie with your belly full While around you people may be badly yearning for dried leather\.\.\.?

Shall I be content with being called Amr al \-Mu’minin \(Commander of the Faithful\), although I do not share with the people the hardships of the world? Or shall I be an example for them in the distresses of life? I have not been created to keep myself busy eating good foods

<a id="page794"></a>like a tied animal whose only worry is his fodder or like a loose animal whose activity is to swallow\. It fills its belly with its feed and forgets the purpose behind it\. Shall I be left uncontrolled to pasture freely, or draw the rope of misguidance or roam aimlessly in the paths of bewilderment?

I see as if one of you will say that if this is what the son of Abu Talib eats, then weakness must have made him unfit to fight his foes and encounter the brave ones\. Remember that the tree of the forest is the best timber, while green twigs have soft bark and the wild bushes are very strong for burning and slow in dying\. My relationship with the Messenger of Allah is that of one branch with another, or like the wrist with the forearm\. By Allah, if the Arabs join together to fight me, I will not run away from them, and if I get the opportunity, I will hasten to catch them by their necks\. I shall surely strive to relieve the earth of this man of perverse mind and uncouth body till the bits of earth are removed from the grain\.

**An excerpt from the same which is the end of the letter:**

Get away from me, O world\! Your rein is on your own shoulders as I have released myself from your clutches, removed myself from your snares and avoided walking into your slippery places\. Where are those whom you have deceived by your jokes? Where are those communities whom you have enticed with your embellishments? They are all confined to graves and hidden in burial places\. By Allah, if you had been a visible personality and a body capable of feeling, I will have awarded you the penalties fixed by Allah because of the people whom you received through desires, the communities whom you threw into destruction and the rulers whom you consigned to ruin and drove to places of distress after which there is neither going nor returning\. Indeed, whoever stepped on your slippery place slipped, whoever rode your waves was drowned, and whoever evaded your snares received inward support\. Whoever keeps himself safe from you does not worry even though his affairs may be straitened and the world to him is like a day which is near to expire\.

Get away from me for, by Allah, I do not bow before you so that you may humiliate me, nor do I let loose the reins for you so that you may drive me away\! I swear by Allah an oath wherein I, except if Allah wills otherwise, shall so train myself that it will feel joyed if it gets one loaf to eat and be content with only salt to season it\. I shall let my eyes empty themselves of tears like the stream whose water has flown away\. Should Ali eat whatever he has and fall asleep like the cattle who fill their stomachs from the pasture land then lie down, or as the grazing goats, eat

<a id="page795"></a>the green grass then go into their pen\! His eyes may die if he, after long years, follows the ways of loose cattle and pasturing animals\.

Blessed is whoever carries out his obligations towards Allah and endures his hardships, allows himself no sleep in the night but when sleep overpowers him, he lies down on the ground using his hand as a pillow, along with those who keep their eyes wakeful in fear of the Day of Judgement, whose bodies are ever away from beds, whose lips are humming in remembrance of Allah and whose sins have been erased through their prolonged beseeching for forgiveness\. They are the party of Allah; Be it known, “\.\.\. verily the part of Allah alone shall be the successful one” \(Holy Quran, 58: 22\)\. Therefore, O Ibn Hunayf, fear Allah and be content with your own loaves so that you may escape Hell\.

Fadak was a green fertile village near Medina in the Hijaz region, and it also had a fortress called ash\-Shumrukh \(Mu’jam al\-Buldan, Vol\. 4, p\. 238; Mu’jam Masta’jam, al\-Bakri, Vol\. 3, p\. 1015; Al\-Rawd al\-Mi’tar, al\-Himyari, p\. 437; Wafa’ al\-Wafa’, Vol\. 4, p\. 1280\)\. Fadak belonged to the Jews\. In the year 7 A\.H\., its ownership went from the Jews to the Prophet \(h\) under the terms of a peace settlement\. The reason for this

settlement was that after the fall of Khaybar, the Jews realized the real power of the Muslims, their martial aspirations were lowered\. Noting that the Prophet \(h\) had spared the lives of some Jews who sought his

protection, the Jews also sent a message of peace to the Prophet \(h\) and

expressed their desire that Fadak should be taken from them so that their area should not be turned into a battlefield\. Consequently, the Prophet \(h\) accepted their request and granted them amnesty\. This land became

his personal property wherein no one else had any right or claim, nor could there be any interest because the Muslims had a share only in those properties which they acquired as booty after jihad, whereas property acquired without jihad is called fay’ and only the Prophet \(h\) was

entitled to it\. No other person has a share in it\. Thus, Allah says the following: “And whatever Allah bestows on His Messenger from them, you did not stir any horse or a camel towards it, but Allah grants authority to whomsoever of His Messengers He pleases; and Allah over all things is all\-Powerful” \(Holy Quran, 59: 6\)\.

No one has ever disputed the fact that Fadak was secured without battle\. It was, therefore, the Prophet’s personal property to which no one else was entitled\. The Historians write:\.

<a id="page796"></a>“Fadak was personal to the Prophet \(h\) as the Muslims did not

use their horses or camels to acquire it” \(Tarikh, al\-Tabari, Vol\. 1, pp\. 1582\-583, 1589; Al\-Kamil, Ibn al\-Athir, Vol\. 2, pp\. 224\-225; As\-Sira, Ibn Hisham, Vol\. 3, p\. 368; Tarikh, Ibn Khaldun, Vol\. 2, part 2, p\. 40; Tarikh al\-Khamis, ad\-Diyar\-Bakri, Vol\. 2, p\. 58; Al\-Sira al\-Halabiyya, Vol\. 3, p\. 50\)\.

The historian and geographical scholar, Ahmed ibn Yahya al\-Baladhiri \(d\. 279/892\), writes the following: “Fadak was the personal property of the Prophet \(h\) as the Muslims had not used their horses nor camels for its acquisition” \(Fath al\-Buldan, Vol\. 1, p\. 33\)\.

Umar ibn al\-Khattab had himself regarded Fadak as the unshared property of the Holy Prophet \(h\) when he declared the following: “The

property of Banu an \-Nadir was among that which Allah bestowed on His Messenger\. Against them \[its original Jewish owners\], neither horses nor camels were stirred\. It belonged to the Messenger of Allah specifically” \(Sahih, al\-Bukhari, Vol\. 4, p\. 46; Vol\. 7, p\. 82; Vol\. 9, pp\. 121\-122 Sahih, Muslim, Vol\. 5, p\. 151; Al\- Sunan, Abu Dawud, Vol\. 3, pp\. 139\-141; Al\-Sunan, al\-Nisa’i, Vol\. 7, p\. 132; Al\-Musnad, Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Vol\. 1,

1. 25, 48, 60, 208; Al\-Sunan al\-Kubra, al\-Bayhayqi, Vol\. 6, pp\. 296\-

299\)\.

It is also proven, in the accepted way, that the Prophet \(h\) had in his lifetime given this land \(Fadak\) to Fatima \(x\) as a gift\. It is narrated

through al \-Bazzar, Abu Ya\`li, Ibn Abu Hatim, Ibn Mardawayh and others from Abu Sa’id al\-Khudri and through Ibn Mardawayh from Abdullah ibn Abbas that when the verse: “And give to the near of kin his due\.\.\.” \(Holy Quran, 17: 26\) was revealed, the Holy Prophet \(h\) called Fatima \(x\) and

gave her Fadak as a gift” \(Al\-Durr al\-Manthur, al\-Sayyuti, vol, 4, p\. 177; Majma’ al\-Zawa’id, al\-Haythami, vol, 7, p\. 46; Kanz al\-Ummal, al\-Muttaqi al\-Hindi, Vol\. 3, p\. 439; Ruh al\-Ma’ani, al\-Alusi, Vol\. 15, p\. 62\)\.

When Abu Bakr assumed power then, in view of reaping some benefits for his government, he turned Fatima \(x\) out of Fadak and took it from her possession\. Thus, the historians write: “Certainly, Abu Bakr snatched Fadak from Fatima \(x\) \(Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Ibn Abul\-Hadid,

Vol\. 16, p\. 219; Wafa’ul\-Wafa’, as\-Samhudi, Vol\. 3, p\. 1000; Al\-Sawa’iq al\-Muhriqa, Ibn Hajar, p\. 32\)\.

<a id="page797"></a>Fatima \(x\) raised her objection against such an injustice\. Protesting to Abu Bakr, she said, “You have taken over the possession of Fadak although the Prophet \(h\) had given it to me as a gift during his lifetime\.” To this, Abu Bakr asked her to produce a witness for the gift\. Consequently, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and Umm Ayman testified in her favor\. Umm Ayman was the freed bondmaid and the dry nurse of the Holy Prophet \(h\)\. She was the mother of Usamah ibn Zayd ibn al\-Harithah\. The Holy Prophet \(h\) used to say, “Umm Ayman is my mother

after my own mother” \[Al\- Mustadrak, Vol\. 4, p\. 63; al\- Tabari, Vol\. 3, p\. 3460; Al\-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 4, p\. 1793; Usd al\-Ghaba, Vol\. 5, p\. 567\. The Holy Prophet \(h\) testified that she is among the people of Paradise \(Ibn Sa\`d,

Vol\. 8, p\. 192; Al\-Isaba, Vol\. 4, p\. 432\)\. But this testimony was held inadmissible by Abu Bakr, and Fatima’s claim was rejected as being based on a false statement\. About this, al\-Baladhiri writes the following: “Fatima \(x\) said to Abu Bakr, ‘The Messenger of Allah had appropriated Fadak to me\. Therefore, give it to me\.’ He asked her for a witness other than Umm Ayman, saying, ‘O daughter of the Prophet \(h\)\! You know

that testimony is not admissible except by two men or one man and two women\.”

After these facts, there remains no possibility of denying that Fadak was the personal property of the Prophet \(h\) and that he had

completed its gifting to her by handing over possession in his own lifetime\. But Abu Bakr took over its possession and dislodged her from it\. In this regard, he rejected the testimony of Ali and Umm Ayman on the ground that the requirement of testimony was not completed when only one man and one woman testify\. Besides them, Imam Hassan and Imam Hussain \(x\), too, testified in support for Fatima \(x\), but their testimony,

too, was rejected on the ground that the testimony of the offspring and “minors” was not acceptable in favor of their parents\. Then Rabah, slave of the Holy Prophet \(h\), was also produced as a witness in support for

the claim of Fatima \(x\), brining the number of witnesses to five\. But the

testimony of the virtuous Rabah, too, was rejected \(Fath al\-Buldan, al\-Baladhiri, Vol\. 1, p\. 35; Tarikh, al\- Ya\`qubi, Vol\. 3, p\. 195; Muruj al\-Dhahab, al\- Mas\`udi, Vol\. 3, p\. 237; Al \-Awa’il, Abu Hilal al\-Askari, p\. 209; Wafa’ al\-Wafa’, Vol\. 3, pp\. 999, 1000\-1001; Mu’jam al\- Buldan, Yaqut al\-Hamawi, Vol\. 4, p\. 239; Sharh, Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 16, pp\. 216, 219\-220, 274; Al\-Muhalla, Ibn Hazm, Vol\. 6, p\. 507; Al\-Sira al\-Halabiyya, Vol\. 3, p\. 361; At\-Tafsir, al\-Fakhr ar\-Radi, Vol\. 29, p\. 284\)\.

<a id="page798"></a>At this stage, the question arises that when Fatima’s possession of Fadak is admitted, as Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) also clarifies in this letter by saying, “We had Fadak in our possession,” what was the meaning of asking Fatima \(x\) to produce testimony in support for her

claim since the onus of proof does not lie on the person with the claim of ownership? The onus of proof lies on the person filing a counter claim, an objection, because possession itself constitutes a proof\. As such, it was Abu Bakr who was required to produce a proof to the lawfulness of his own taking the contested land from its owner\. In the case, if he is unable to do so, Fatima’s possession will mean an testimony of her lawful ownership\. As such, it will be wrong to ask her to produce some more proof or testimony on her own\.

It is strange that when other claims of this nature came before Abu Bakr, he arbitrated them in favor of the claimant merely on the basis of the claim: The claimant is neither asked to provide proof of his claim nor to produce witnesses\. Why did Abu Bakr apply a different standard in the case of “Sayyidatu Nisaa’ al\-‘Aalameen”? Did he hold the daughter of the Prophet \(k\) as a liar? Or did he have other political objectives in

mind when he treated her with such injustice? In this regard, the traditionists write the following: “It is related from Jabir ibn \`Abdillah al\-Ansari that he said that the Messenger of Allah \(k\) had said that when

the booty from Bahrain arrived, he would allow him such\-and\- such of it, but the booty did not arrive till the Prophet’s death\. When it arrived during the days of Abu Bakr, he went to the latter to claim it\. Abu Bakr made the announcement that whoever had a claim against the Messenger of Allah or against whomsoever he had made a promise should come for his claim\. So, I went to him and told him that the Prophet \(h\) had

promised to give me such \-and\- such property out of the booty from Bahrain whereupon he gave me all of that” \(Sahih, al \-Bukhari, Vol\. 3, pp\. 119, 209, 236; Vol\. 4, p\. 110; Vol\. 5, p\. 218; Sahih, Muslim, Vol\. 7, pp\. 75\- 76; Al\-Jami’ al\-Sahih, al\-Tirmidhi, Vol\. 5, p\. 129; Al \-Musnad, Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Vol\. 3, pp\. 307\-308; Al\-Tabaqat al\-Kubra, Ibn Sa\`d, Vol\. 2, part 2, pp\.88\-89\)\.

In the annotations of this tradition, Shihabud\-Din Ahmed ibn Ali \(Ibn Hajar\) al\-Asqalani ash\-Shafi’i \(773/1372\-852/1449\) and Badrud\-Din Mahmud ibn Ahmed al\-Ayni al\-Hanafi \(762/1361\-855/1451\) have written the following: “This tradition leads to the conclusion that the testimony of one equitable companion can be admitted as full testimony \[equal to two or more\] even though it may be in his own personal favor because Abu Bakr did not ask Jabir to produce any \[other\] witness to prove his claim\.

<a id="page799"></a>\(Fath al\-Bari fi Sharh Sahih al\-Bukhari, Vol\. 5, p\. 380; Umdatul\-Qari fi Sharh Sahih al\-Bukhari, Vol\. 12, p\. 121\)\.

If it is lawful to grant property to Jabir on the basis of good impression about him without calling for witness or testimony anyone at all, then what stopped allowing Fatima’s claim on the basis of similar good impressions? Or was Abu Bakr ’s impression of the Head of the Women of Mankind not good at all? If good impression could exist in the case of Jabir to such an extent that he would not benefit by speaking a lie, then why should there not be the good belief about Fatima \(x\) that she

would not attribute a false saying to the Prophet \(h\) just for a piece of

land? Firstly, her admitted truthfulness and honesty was enough for holding her truthful in her claim\. Moreover, the testimony of Ali and Umm Ayman in her favor was also available besides other evidences\. It has been said that the claim could not be decided in favor of Fatima \(x\)

on the basis of these two witnesses because the Holy Quran lays down the principle of testimony that: “\.\.\. \.then call to witness two witnesses from among your men and if there not be two men, then a man and two men” \(Holy Quran, 2: 282\)\.

If this principle is universal and general, then it should be taken into regard on every occasion, not selectively\. But on some occasions, it is found not to have been followed at all\. For example, when an Arab had a dispute with the Prophet \(h\) about a camel, Khuzaymah ibn Thabit al\-

Ansari gave testimony in favor of the Prophet \(h\), and this one single

witness was deemed to be equal to two because there was no doubt in the honesty and truthfulness of this individual in whose favor the testimony was led\. It was for this reason that the Holy Prophet \(h\) granted him the

title of “Dhul\-Shahadatayn” \(i\.e\. one whose testimony is equivalent to that of two\) \(al\-Bukhari, Vol\. 4, p\. 24; Vol\. 6, p\. 146; Abu Dawud, Vol\. 3, p\. 308; al\-Nisa’i, Vol\. 7, p\. 302; Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Vol\. 5, pp\. 188, 189, 216; Al\-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 2, p\. 448; Usd al\-Ghaba, Vol\. 2, p\. 114; Al \-Isaba, Vol\. 1, pp\. 425\-426; Al\-Musannaf, as\-Sanani, Vol\. 8, pp\. 366\-368\)\.

Consequently, neither was the generality of the verse about testimony affected by this action, nor was it deemed to be against the cannons of testimony\. So, if here, in view of the Prophet’s truthfulness, one testimony in his favor was deemed to be equal to two, then could not the testimony of Ali and Umm Ayman be regarded sufficient Fatima \(x\)

in view of her moral greatness and truthfulness? Besides, this verse does not show that there can be no other way of establishing a claim other than

<a id="page800"></a>these two methods\. In this regard, judge Nurullah al \-Mar’ashi at\-Tustari \(956/1549\-1019/1610\) has written the following in Ihqaq \-al\-Haqq, chapter on al\-Mata’in: “The view of the contention that Umm Ayman’s testimony remained incomplete is wrong on the grounds that from certain traditions, it is seen that it is lawful to give a decision on the basis of one single witness, and it does not necessarily mean that the injunction of the Holy Quran has been violated because this verse means that a decision can be given on the strength of the testimony of two men or one man and two women and that their testimony is enough\. From this, it does not appear that if there are some other grounds besides the testimony of witnesses that are unacceptable and that verdict cannot be given on its basis, unless it is argued that this is the only meaning for this verse\. But since every meaning is not a final argument, this notion can be brushed aside, particularly because the tradition clearly points to a contrary notion and ignoring the notion does not necessarily mean violating the verse\. Secondly, the verse allows a choice between the testimony of two men or that of one man and two women\. If, by virtue of the tradition, a third choice is added, namely that a verdict can be passed by means of other testimony as well, then how does it necessitate that the Quranic verse should stand violated?\!”

In any case, from this reply, it is clear that a claimant is not obligated to produce the testimony of two men or that of one man and two women in support for the claim\. This is so because if there is one witness and the claimant swears an oath, he can then be taken to have legitimacy in his claim and a decision can be given in his favor\. In this regard, it has been narrated by more than twelve companions of the Holy Prophet \(h\)

that the Messenger of Allah \(h\) used to decide cases on the strength of one single witness and the taking of an oath\.

It has been explained by some companions of the Prophet \(h\)

and by some scholars of jurisprudence that this decision is specially related to rights, property and transactions, and this decision was practiced by the three caliphs: Abu Bakr, \`Umar and Othman \(Muslim, Vol\. 5, p\. 128; Abu DawÅ d, Vol\. 3, pp\. 308\- 309; al\-Tirmidhi, Vol\. 3, pp\. 627\- 629; Ibn Majah, Vol\. 2, p\. 793; Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Vol\. 1, pp\. 248, 315, 323; Vol\. 3, p\. 305; Vol\. 5, p\. 285; Malik ibn Anas, Al\-Muwatta’, Vol\. 2, pp\. 721 \-725; al\-Bayhaqi, Al\-Sunan al\-Kubra, Vol\. 10, pp\. 167\-176; Al\-Sunan, al\-Dar Qutni, Vol\. 4, pp\. 212\-215; Majma’az\-Zawa’id, Vol\. 4, p\. 202; Kanz al\-\`Ummal, Vol\. 7, p\. 13\)\.

<a id="page801"></a>When decisions were issued based on the strength of one witness and one oath, then even if in Abu Bakr’s view the requirement of testimony was incomplete, he should have asked her to swear an oath then give a decision in her favor\. But here the very objective was to tarnish the image of truthfulness of Fatima \(x\) so that in the future the question of

her testimony should not arise\.

However, when Fatima’s claim was rejected in this manner and Fadak was not accepted as the Prophet’s gift to her, she claimed it on the basis of inheritance saying: “If you do not agree that the Prophet \(h\) had

gifted it to me, you cannot at least deny that Fadak and the revenues of Khaybar as well as the lands around Medina were the Prophet’s personal properties and I am his only heir\.” Yet she was deprived of her inheritance on the basis of a tradition related by Abu Bakr himself that the Holy Prophet \(h\) said, “We, prophets, have no successors, and whatever

we leave behind constitutes charity” \(al\-Bukhari, Vol\. 4, p\. 96; Vol\. 5, pp\. 25\-26, 115, 117; Vol\. 8, p\. 185; Muslim, Vol\. 5, pp\. 153 \-155; al\-Tirmidhi, Vol\. 4, pp\. 157 \-158; Abu Dawud, Vol\. 3, pp\. 142\- 143; al\-Nisa’i, Vol\. 7, p\. 132; Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Vol\. 1, pp\. 4, 6, 9, 10; al\-Bayhaqi, Vol\. 6, p\. 300; Ibn Sa\`d, Vol\. 2, part 2, pp\. 86\-87; al\-Tabari, Vol\. 1, p\. 1825; Tarikh al\-Khamis, Vol\. 2, pp\. 173\-174\)\.

Besides Abu Bakr, nobody else had any knowledge of this statement which was presented to the public as a tradition of the Prophet \(h\), nor had anyone from among the companions heard it at all\. Who is

the truthful one, Fatima \(x\) or Abu Bakr? Thus, Jalalu’d\-Din \`Abd ar\-

Rahman ibn Abu Bakr al\-Sayyuti ash\-Shafi’i \(849/1445\-911/1505\) and Shihabud\-Din Ahmed ibn Muhammad \(Ibn Hajar\) al\-Haytami ash\- Shafi’i \(909/1504\-974/1567\) have written the following: “After the death of the Prophet \(h\), there was a difference of opinion about inheritance and no

one had any information in this matter\. Then, Abu Bakr said that he had heard the Messenger of Allah saying, ‘We, prophets, leave no successors, and whatever we leave behind constitutes charity’” \(Tarikh al\-Khulafa’, p\.73; Al\-Sawa’iq al\-Muhriqa, p\. 19\)\.

The mind refuses to believe that the Prophet \(h\) should not tell

those individuals who could be deemed as his successors that they would not inherit and inform a third party that did not have even the most remote kinship to him, that there would be no heir/successor to him\. Is not AbÅ Bakr considered as a “successor” of the Prophet \(k\) by many people?\! Is there no contradiction here?\! Then this story was made public only when

<a id="page802"></a>the issue of Fadak was raised in the court of Abu Bakr who himself constituted the contesting party\! In such circumstances, how can his presenting in his own support a tradition which no one else at all had ever heard be deemed permissible? If it is argued that this tradition should be relied upon in view of the greatness of the status of Abu Bakr, then why can Fatima’s claim to the said gift not be relied upon because of her honesty and truthfulness, more so when the testimony of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and that of Umm Ayman, as well as of others as well, was

also in her favor? If necessity was felt to call more witnesses in her case, then testimony can also be called for regarding this alleged unheard\-of “tradition”, particularly since this “tradition” contradicted the general instructions of the Holy Quran relevant to the issue of succession and inheritance\. How can a tradition which is weak in the manner of its relating and altered and the authenticity of which is questioned on the basis of facts to the contrary be deemed to specify a generality of the Quranic injunction on inheritance/succession because the question of the inheritance of the prophets is clearly mentioned in the Holy Quran\. In this regard, Allah says the following: “\.\.\. And Solomon inherited David” \(Holy Quran, 27: 16\)\. So, prophets do leave heirs/successors\.\.\.

At another place, the following is stated by prophet Zakariyya: “\.\.\. Grant me from Yourself an heir who shall inherit me and inherit the family of Jacob” \(Holy Quran, 19: 5\-6\)\. So, prophets do leave heirs/successors\.\.\.

In these verses, succession refers to inheriting estates, etc\. To take it in its figurative meaning of succession in prophetic knowledge would not only be absurd but also against established facts because knowledge and Prophethood are not objects of succession, nor do they possess the quality of transmission through inheritance, for in that case, all the descendants of the prophets would have been prophets\. There is no sense in making a distinction that the progeny of some prophets may inherit Prophethood while others should remain deprived of it\. It is strange that the theory of transmission of Prophethood through inheritance is propagated by those who have always laid the objection against the Sh\`as that they regard the Imamate and the caliphate as an objective of inheritance and confined to one family only\. Would not Prophethood become an objective of inheritance by taking succession in this verse to mean succession to the Prophethood?

If, in Abu Bakr’s view, by virtue of this tradition, there could be no successor of the Prophet \(h\), then where was this tradition when a

<a id="page803"></a>document had been written admitting Fatima’s claim for succession? Thus, Nurud\-Din Ali ibn Ibrahim al\-Halabi ash\-Shafi’i \(975/1567\-1044/1635\) quotes Shamsu’d\-Din Yusuf \(Sibt ibn al\-Jawzi\) al\-Hanafi \(581/1185\-654/1256\) narrating the following: “Abu Bakr was on the pulpit when Fatima \(x\) came to him and said, ‘O Abu Bakr\! The Holy

Quran should allow your daughter to inherit you, yet I am not to inherit my father\!’ Abu Bakr started weeping and descended from the pulpit\. Then he wrote her a statement about Fadak\. At that time, Umar arrived and inquired what the written sheet was all about\. Abu Bakr replied, ‘It is a document which I have written for Fatima \(x\) about the inheritance

from her father\.’ Umar said, ‘What will you spend on the Muslims while the Arabs are waging war against you, as you see?’ Then Umar took the document and tore it to pieces” \(Al\-Sira al\-Halabiyya, Vol\. 3, pp\. 361\-362\)\.

Every sensible person who takes note of this behavior can easily reach the conclusion that this tradition is concocted and wrong\. It was fabricated only to secure possession of Fadak and other inheritances\. Consequently, Fatima \(x\) refused to accept it and expressed her anger in

this way: She made a will about Abu Bakr and \`Umar that the two should not participate in her funeral prayers\. Aisha narrated the following: “Fatima \(x\), the daughter of the Holy Prophet \(h\), sent for Abu Bakr

\(after he became caliph following the death of the Holy Prophet \(h\) claiming from him her inheritance left for her by the Messenger of Allah from what Allah had bestowed \(specifically\) upon him in Medna and Fadak and what was left from the fifth \(khums\) of the income from Khaybar\. Abu Bakr refused to hand over anything from it to Fatima \(x\)\.

Then, Fatima \(x\) became angry with Abu Bakr and forsook him and did

not talk to him till the end of her life\. When she died, her husband, Ali ibn Abu Talib, buried her at night\. He did not inform Abu Bakr about her death and performed the funeral prayers for her personally” \(al\-Bukhari, Vol\. 5, p\. 177; Vol\. 8, p\. 185; Muslim, Vol\. 5, pp\. 153\- 155; al\-Bayhaqi, Vol\. 4, p\. 29; Vol\. 6, pp\. 300\-301; Ibn Sa\`d, Vol\. 2, part 2, p\. 86; Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Vol\. 1, p\. 9; al\-Tabari, Vol\. 1, p\. 1825; Ibn Kathir, Tarikh, Vol\. 5, pp\. 285\-286; Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 6, p\. 46 and Wafa’ al\-Wafa’,Vol\. 3, p\. 995\)\.

In this regard, Umm Ja\`far, the daughter of Muhammad ibn Ja\`far, narrated the following about the request of Fatima \(x\), who was

nearing her death, to Asma’ daughter of \`Umays: “When I die, I want you and Ali to wash me and do not allow anyone to go into my house\.”

<a id="page804"></a>When she died, Aisha came to enter, but Asma’ said to her, “Do not enter\.” Aisha complained to Abu Bakr \(her father\) saying, “This Khath’amiyya \(woman from the tribe of Kath’am\) intervenes between us and the daughter of the Messenger of Allah \(h\)\.” Abu Bakr came out, stood at the door and said, “O Asma’\! What makes you prevent the wives of the Prophet \(h\) from entering to see the daughter of the Messenger of

Allah?” Asma’ replied, “She had herself ordered me not to allow anyone to enter\.” Abu Bakr said, “Do what she has ordered you” \(Hilyat al\-Awliya’, Vol\. 2, p\. 43; Al\-Sunan al\-Kubra, Vol\. 3, p\. 396; Vol\. 4, p\. 334; Ansab al\-Ashraf, Vol\. 1, p\. 405; Al\-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 4, pp\. 1897\-1898; Usd al\-Ghaba, Vol\. 5, p\. 524; Al\-Isaba, Vol\. 4, pp\. 378\-379\)\.

Fatima \(x\) had also made a request to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

that she must be buried at night, that no one should come to her, that Abu Bakr and Umar should not be notified about her death and burial, and that Abu Bakr should not be allowed to perform the funeral prayer for her\.

When she died, Ali washed and buried her in the dark of the night without notifying Abu Bakr and Umar\. So, these two were not aware of her burial\.

Muhammad ibn Umar al\-Waqidi \(130/747\-207/823\) said the following: “It has been proven to us that Ali \(x\) performed her funeral

prayers and buried her at night accompanied by al\-Abbas \(ibn Abdul\-Muttalib\) and \(his son\) al\-Fadl and did not notify anyone\.”

It was for this reason that the burial place of Fatima \(x\) is hidden

and is unknown, none alive is sure about it \(Al\-Mustadrak, Vol\. 3, pp\. 162\- 163; Al\-Musannaf, Vol\. 4, p\. 141; Ansab al\-Ashraf, Vol\. 1, pp\. 402, 405; Al\-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 4, p\. 1898; Usd al\-Ghaba, Vol\. 5, pp\. 524\-525; Al\-Isaba, Vol\. 4, pp\. 379\-380; al\-Tabari, Vol\. 3, pp\. 2435\-2436; Ibn Sa\`d, Vol\. 8, pp\. 19\-20; Wafa’ al\-Wafa’, Vol\. 3, pp\. 901\-902, 904, 905; Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 16, pp\. 279\-281\)\.

To attribute this displeasure of Fatima \(x\) to sentiments and

thereby to lower its importance does not prompt a correct sentiment: If this displeasure had been the result of sentiments, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) would have stopped her from this out\-of\-place displeasure, but

there is no historical record showing that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) took this displeasure to be as such\. Besides, how could her displeasure be

<a id="page805"></a>the result of personal feelings or sentiments since her pleasure or displeasure always agree with Allah’s will? The Prophet’s following saying is a proof of this: “O Fatima \(x\)\! Surely Allah is angered when you are angered and is pleased when you are pleased” \(Al\-Mustadrak, Vol\. 3,

1. 153; Usd al\-Ghaba, Vol\. 5, p\. 522; Al\-Isaba, Vol\. 4, p\. 366; Tahthib al\-Tahthib, Vol\. 12, p\. 441; Al\-Khasa’is al\-Kubra, Vol\. 2, p\. 265; Kanz al\-Ummal, Vol\. 13, p\. 96; Vol\. 16, p\. 280; Majma’ al\-Zawa’id, Vol\. 9, p\. 203\)\.

**A short history of Fadak after the death of Fatima \(x\):**

The motive which prompts us to pursue the history of Fadak and to extract the series of events after it for a period of three centuries from the texts of historical books is to clarify three issues:

a\. The truth about the rule of annulment of inheritance from prophets allegedly made by the Holy Prophet \(h\); in other words, the claim that property of the Holy Prophet \(h\) is a part of the public

treasury and belongs to all Muslims\. This was claimed by the first caliph, Abu Bakr, and was rejected by his successors, by both next caliphs \(\`Umar and Othman\), by the Umayyads and the Abbassids\. We must consider that the lawfulness and rightfulness of their caliphate depended upon the “correctness” and “lawfulness” of the caliphate of the first caliph and his actions\.

b\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and the descendants of Fatima \(x\) never had any hesitation regarding the rightfulness and justification of their claim\. They emphasized and confirmed that Fatima \(x\) had always

been right and that Abu Bakr’s claim had always been rejected; they did not yield to the false claim\.

c\. Whenever one of the caliphs made a decision to put Allah’s command into effect, with regard to Fadak, to observe justice and equity and to restore the right to the entitled one in conformity with Islamic rules, he used to return Fadak to the descendants of Fatima \(x\)\.

\`Umar ibn al\-Khattab was the most harsh person in keeping

Fatima \(x\) from Fadak and her inheritance as he himself confessed:

“When the Messenger of Allah died, I came along with Abu Bakr to Ali ibn Abu Talib and said, ‘What do you say about what has been left by the Messenger of Allah?’ He replied, ‘We have the most rights with the Holy

<a id="page806"></a>Prophet \(h\)\.’ I \(Umar\) said, ‘Even those properties of Khaybar?’ He

said, ‘Yes, even those of Khaybar\.’ I said, ‘Even those of Fadak?’ He replied, ‘Yes, even those of Fadak\.’ Then I said, ‘By Allah\! We say NO even if you cut our necks with saws’” \(Majma’ al\-Zawa’id, Vol\. 9, pp\. 39\-40\)\.

As it has been mentioned before, \`Umar then took the document \(title of ownership\) of Fadak and tore it up\. But when Umar became caliph \(13/634\-23/644\), he gave Fadak back to inheritors of the Holy Prophet \(h\)\. Yaqut al\-Hamawi \(574/1178\-626/1229\), the famous

historian and geographer, following the event of Fadak, said the following: “Then, when \`Umar ibn al \-Khattab became caliph and gained victories and the Muslims secured abundant wealth \(i\.e\. the public treasury satisfied the caliphate’s needs\), he made his judgement contrary to that of his predecessor\. He gave it \(Fadak\) back to the Prophet’s heirs\. At the time, Ali ibn Abu Talib and Abbas ibn Abdul\-Muttalib disputed about Fadak\.”

Ali said that the Holy Prophet \(h\) had bestowed it on Fatima \(x\) during his lifetime\. Abbas denied this and used to say, “This was in the possession of the Holy Prophet \(h\) and I have a share in this

inheritance\.” They were disputing this with each other and asked Umar to settle the case\. He refused to judge between them and said, “Both of you are more conscious and aware of your problem; but I only give it \[Fadak\] to you” \(Mu’jam al\-Buldan, Vol\. 4, pp\. 238\-239; Wafa’ al\-Wafa’, Vol\. 3,

1. 999; Tahthib al\-Lughah, Vol\. 10, p\. 124; Lisan al\-Arab, Vol\. 10, p\. 473; Taj al\-Arus, Vol\. 7, p\. 166\)\.

The reason why Umar and Abu Bakr were trying to seize Fadak was economic and political, not merely a religious one, as the previous episode shows\. When the economic and political condition of the caliphate improved, and when there was no need for the income obtained from Fadak, Omer changed his own decision\.

The last part of this historic event has been inserted afterwards to demonstrate the matter of inheritance by the brother or paternal uncle of the deceased when the latter had no sons\. This problem is a matter of dispute among Islamic sects\. The judicial and jurisprudential discussion is separate from our own goal in the writing of this book\. We are only discussing the matter historically\.

<a id="page807"></a>Abbas had no claim in this case because he had not proven that he had a share in this property, nor did his descendants consider it to be among their own assets even when they \[the Abbasides\] became caliphs and were ruling the Islamic lands\. They either considered themselves as owners of this estate in their capacity as caliphs, or they used to return it to the descendants of Fatima \(x\) when they had decided to be just

governors\.

When Othman ibn Affan became caliph, following the death of Umar \(23/644\-35/656\), he granted Fadak to Marwan ibn al\-Hakam, his cousin \(Al\-Sunan al\-Kubra, Vol\. 6, p\. 301; Wafa’ al\-Wafa’, Vol\. 3, p\. 1000; Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 1, p\. 198\) and this was one of the causes of hostile feelings among the Muslims against \`Othman \(Al\-Ma’arif, Ibn Qutaybah, p\. 195; Al\-Iqd al \-Farid, Vol\. 4, pp\. 283, 435; Tarikh, Abul\-Fida’, Vol\. 1, p\. 168; Tarikh, Ibn al\-Wardi, Vol\. 1, p\. 204\) which ended in the rebellion against him and in his murder\. “While previously Fatima \(x\)

used to claim it, sometimes as her inheritance and sometimes as a gift \(from her father\), she was driven away from it \(Fadak\) as Ibn Abul\-Hadid said” \(Sharh Nahjul\- Balagha\)\. In this way, Fadak fell into the possession of Marwan\. He used to sell its crops and products for at least ten thousand dinars per year\. If in some years its income decreased, this drop was not made public\. This was its usual profit till the time of the caliphate of Umar ibn Abdul\-Aziz \(in 100/718\) \(Ibn Sa\`d, Vol\. 5, pp\. 286, 287; Subh al\-A’sha, Vol\. 4, p\. 291\)\.

When Mu\`awiyah ibn Abu Sufyan became caliph \(41/661\-60/680\), he became partner with Marwan and others in Fadak\. He allotted one third to Marwan, one third to Amr son of Othman ibn Affan and one third to his own son Yazid\. This was after the death of al\-Hassan ibn Ali \(x\)\. “In order to cause the anger of the progeny of the Holy Prophet \(h\),

as al\-Ya\`qubi states on p\. 199, Vol\. 2 of his Tarikh, it remained in the possession of the three above\-mentioned persons tlil Marwan became caliph \(64/684\-65/685\); he took full possession of it\. Then he doled it out to his two sons, Abdul\-Malik and Abdul\-Aziz\. Then Abdul\-Aziz doled out his share to his son \(\`Umar ibn Abdul\-Azz\)\.

When Umar ibn Abdul\-Aziz became caliph \(99/717\-101/720\), he delivered a sermon once in which he said, “Verily, Fadak was among the things that Allah had bestowed on His Messenger and no horse, nor camel was stirred for it\.” He mentioned the history of the case of Fadak during the past caliphates till he said the following: “Then Marwan \[ibn al\-Hakam\] gave it \(Fadak\) to my father and to Abdul\-Malik\. It became mine

<a id="page808"></a>as well as al\-Walid’s and Sulayman’s \(two sons\)\. When al\-Walid became caliph \(86/705\- 96/715\), I asked him for his share and he gave it to me\. I also asked for Sulayman’s share and he, too, gave it to me\. Then I gathered the three parts and I then possessed no property more dear to me than it\. Testify that I returned it to its original condition\.” He wrote to his governor of Medina \(Abu Bakr ibn Muhammad ibn Amr ibn Hazm\) ordering him to carry out what he had declared in the sermon which he had delivered\. Then Fadak went back to the possession of the children of Fatima \(x\)\. “This was the first removal of oppression by returning it

\(Fadak\) to the children of Ali” \(Al\-Awa’il, Abu Hilal al\-Askari, p\. 209\)\.

They possessed it during the reign of this caliph \[Umar ibn Abd al\-Aziz\]\.

When Yazid ibn Abdul\-Malik became caliph \(101/720\-105/724\), he seized Fadak and they \(the children of Ali\) were again dispossessed\. It fell into the possession of the children of Marwan as it had been previously\. They passed it from one to another tlil their caliphate expired; it was then that it passed away to Banu al\-Abbas\.

When “Abul\-Abbas” Abdullah as\-Saffah became the first caliph of the Abbasid dynasty \(132/749\-136/754\), he gave Fadak back to the children of Fatima \(x\), handing it over to Abdullah ibn al\-Hassan ibn al\-Hassan \[known as al\-Hassan al\-Muthanna or al\-Hassan II\] ibn Ali ibn Abu Talib\(x\)\. When “Abu Ja\`far” Abdullah al\-Mansur ad\-Dawaniqi \(136/754\-158/775\) became caliph, he seized Fadak from the children of al\-Hassan \(x\)\. When Muhammad al\-Mahdi, son of al\-Mansur, became caliph \(158/775\-169/785\), he returned Fadak to the children of Fatima \(x\)\. Then Musa al\-Hadi ibn al\-Mahdi \(169/785\-170/786\) and his brother Harun ar\-Rashid \(170/786\-193/809\) confiscated it from the descendants of Fatima \(x\), and it found itself in the possession of Banu al\-Abbas till the time when al\-Ma’mun became caliph \(193/813\-218/833\)\. Al\-Ma’mun al\-Abbasi gave it back to the descendants of Fatima \(x\) \(210/826\)\. It is

narrated through al\-Mahdi ibn Sabiq that al\- Ma’mun one day sat to hear the complaints of the people and to judge in their disputes\. The first complaint which he received caused him to weep upon considering it\. When he asked where the attorney for the children of Fatima \(x\)

daughter of the Holy Prophet \(h\) was, an old man stood up and came

forth\. He argued with him about Fadak, and al\-Ma’mun, too, argued till he won the argument over al\- Ma’mun \(Al\-Awa’il, p\. 209\)\. Al \-Ma’mun summoned the Islamic faqihs and questioned them about the claim of Banu Fatima \(x\)\. They narrated to al\-Ma’mun saying that the Holy

<a id="page809"></a>Prophet \(h\) gave Fadak to Fatima \(x\) as a gift and that after the death of the Holy Prophet \(h\), Fatima \(x\) demanded Abu Bakr to return Fadak to

her\. He asked her to bring witnesses to her claim regarding this gift\. She brought Ali, al\-Hassan, al\-Hussain and Umm Ayman as her witnesses\. They testified in the case in her favor\. Abu Bakr rejected their testimony\. Then al\-Ma’mun asked the Islamic faqihs: “What is your view about Umm Ayman?” They replied, “She is a woman to whom the Holy Prophet \(h\) testified that she is a resident of Paradise\.” Al\-Ma’mun

disputed at length with them and forced them to accept his argument\. They finally confessed that Ali, al\-Hassan, al\-Hussain and Umm Ayman had testified only to the truth\. When they unanimously adopted this stand, he restored Fadak to the descendants of Fatima \(x\) \(Tarikh, al\-Ya\`qubi, Vol\. 3, pp\. 195\-196\)\.

Then al\-Ma’mun ordered the estate \(of Fadak\) to be registered among the property \(of the descendants of Fatima \[x\]\), and it was

registered; al\-Ma’mun signed it\. Then he wrote a letter to his governor in

Medina, namely Qutham ibn Ja\`far, as follows:

Be informed that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), exercising the authority vested upon him by the divine religion as the Caliph, successor and kinsman of the Holy Prophet \(h\), has considered himself more deserving to follow the precedent of the Holy Prophet \(h\) and to carry out his commands\. And \(the chief is more entitled\) to restore to the rightful persons any endowment gifted by the Holy Prophet \(h\) or anything which the Holy Prophet \(h\) had gifted to anyone\. The success and safeguarding of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) is done by Allah, and he is particularly anxious to act in a way which would win the pleasure of the Almighty for him\. Verily, the Holy Prophet \(h\) had gifted the estate of Fadak to his daughter Fatima \(x\)\. He had transferred its ownership to her\. It is a clear and an established fact\. None of the kindred of the Holy Prophet \(h\) have any difference of view in this regard\. Fatima \(x\)

always claimed that which was more deserving \(to be justified\) than the person \(Abu Bakr\) whose word was accepted\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(xn \) considers it right and proper to restore Fadak to the heirs of Fatima

\(x\)\. He would hereby win nearness to Allah Almighty by establishing His justice and right\. It will win the appreciation of the Holy Prophet \(h\) by carrying into effect his commandments\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib

<a id="page810"></a>\(x\) has commanded that this restoration of Fadak should duly be registered\. This command should be transmitted to all the officials\.

Then, if, as it was a custom to proclaim on every hajj gathering \(every year\), following the death of the Holy Prophet \(h\), that anyone to whom the Holy Prophet \(h\) had promised by way of a gift or a present should come forward, his statement will be accepted and the promise will thus be fulfilled\. Certainly, Fatima \(x\) had a superior right to have her statements accepted in the matter of the gifting of Fadak by the Holy Prophet \(h\) to her\.

Verily, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has commanded his slave Mubarak al\-Tabari to restore Fadak to the descendants of Fatima \(x\) the daughter of the Holy Prophet \(h\) with all its borders, rights and slaves attached thereto, cereal crops and other things\.

The same has been restored to Muhammad ibn Yahya ibn al\-Hassan ibn Zayd ibn Ali ibn al\-Hussain ibn Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and Muhammad ibn \`Abdullah ibn al\-Hassan ibn Ali ibn al\-Hussain ibn Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\.

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has appointed both of them as the agents representing the owners of the lands: the heirs of Fatima \(x\)\. Be then informed that this is the view of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and that Allah has inspired him to obey the order of Allah and to win His pleasure and the pleasure of the Holy Prophet \(h\)\. Let also your

subordinates know this\. Behave towards Muhammad ibn Yahya and Muhammad ibn Abdillah in the same manner as you used to behave towards Mubarak al \-Tabari\. Help them both to everything which has anything to do with its flourishing and prosperity, its improvement in abundance of cereals by Allah’s will, and that is the end of the matter\.

Written this Wednesday, two nights past Dhul\-Qi\`dah, in the year 210 \(February 15, 826 A\.D\.\)\.

During the period of al\-Ma’mun’s caliphate, Fadak was in the possession of Fatima’s descendants\. This continued during the caliphate of al\-Mu’tasim \(218/833\-227/842\) and that of al\-Wathiq \(227/842\-232/847\)\.

<a id="page811"></a>When Ja\`far al\-Mutawakkil became caliph \(232/847\-247/861\), the one among them who was marked as an arch\-enemy of the progeny of the Holy Prophet \(h\), both of those alive and of those dead, gave the

order to re\-seize Fadak from the descendants of Fatima \(x\)\. He seized it

and gave it to Harmalah al\-Hajjam \(the cupper\)\. After the death of al\-Hajjam, he gave it to al \-Bazyar \(the falconer, a native of Tabaristan\) \(Kashf al\-Ghumma, Vol\. 2, pp\. 121 \-122; Bihar al\-Anwar, \[1st ed\.\], Vol\. 8, p\. 108; Safinat al\-Bihar, Vol\. 2, p\. 351\)\. Abu Hilal al\-‘Askari mentioned that his name was \`Abdullah ibn \`Umar al\-Bazyar and added: “\.\.\. And there were in it \(Fadak\) eleven date\-palm trees which the Holy Prophet \(h\) had planted with his own hands\. The descendants of Abu

Talib used to gather these dates\. When pilgrims \(hujjaj\) entered Medina, these descendants donated the dates to them\. Through this, they received a considerable return\. This news reached al\-Mutawakkil\. He ordered Abdullah ibn Umar to gather the fruits and to squeeze the juice from them\. Abdullah ibn Umar sent a man named Bishr ibn Umayyah ath\-Thaqafi who squeezed the fruits\. It was reported that he made it into wine\. It had not reached Basra \(on its way to the caliph\) before it decayed, and by then al\-Mutawakkil was killed \(Al\-Awa’il, p\. 209\)\. When al\-Mutawakkil was killed and al\-Muntasir \(his son\) succeeded him \(247/861\-248/862\), the latter gave the order to restore Fadak to the descendants of al\-Hassan and al\-Hussain \(x\) and delivered the donations

of Abu Talib to them; this was in 248/862\. \(Ref\. Nos\. 3\-13, Fath al\-Buldan, Vol\. 1, pp\. 33\-38; Mu’jam al\- Buldan, Vol\. 4, pp\. 238\-240; Tarikh, al\-Ya\`qubi, Vol\. 2, p\. 199; Vol\. 3, pp\. 48, 195\-196; Al \-Kamil, Ibn al\-Athir, Vol\. 2, pp\. 224\-225; Vol\. 3, pp\. 457, 497; Vol\. 5, p\. 63; Vol\. 7,

1. 116; Al\-\`Iqd al\-Farid, Vol\. 4, pp\. 216, 283, 435; Wafa’ al\-Wafa’, Vol\. 3, pp\. 999\-1000; Al\-Tabaqat al\-Kubra, Vol\. 5, pp\. 286\-287; Tarikh al\-Khulafa’, pp\. 231\-232, 356; Muruj al\-Dhahab, Vol\. 4, p\. 82; Sirat Umar ibn Abdul\-Aziz, Ibn al\-Jawzi, p\. 110; Subh al\-A’sha, Vol\. 4, p\. 291; Jamharat Rasa’il al\-\`Arab, Vol\. 2, pp\. 331\-332; Vol\. 3, pp\. 509\-510; A’lam an\-Nisa’, Vol\. 3, pp\. 1211\-1212; Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 16, pp\. 277\-278; Al\-Awa’il, p\. 209; Kashf al\-Ghumma, Vol\. 2, pp\. 120\-122; Bihar al\-Anwar, Vol\. 8, pp\. 107\-108\)\.

It seemed that Fadak was re\-seized from the descendants of Fatima \(x\) after the death of al\-Muntasir \(248\-862\) because “Abul\-Hassan” Ali ibn Isa al\-Irbili \(d\. 692/1293\) stated that al\-Mu’tadid \(279/892\-289/902\) returned Fadak to the descendants of Fatima \(x\)\. Then he mentioned that al\-Muqtafi \(289/902\-295/908\) seized it from them\. It is

<a id="page812"></a>said also that al\-Muqtadir \(295/908\-320/932\) returned it to them \(the descendants of Fatima \[x\]\) \(Kashf al\-Ghumma, Vol\. 2, p\. 122; Bihar al\-Anwar, Vol\. 8, p\. 108; Safina, Vol\. 2, p\. 351\)\.

After this long period of re\-seizing and restoring, Fadak was returned to the possession of the usurpers and their heirs\. It seems there is no further mention that such changing hands was ever made in history, and the curtain fell\. “Is it then that the judgement of \(the times of pagan\) ignorance that they desire? And who \(else\) can be better than Allah to judge for a people of assured faith?” \(Holy Quran, 5: 50\)\.
