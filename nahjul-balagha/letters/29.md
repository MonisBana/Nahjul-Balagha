**Letter 29**

**To the people of Basra**

Whatever disunity and schism you have is not hidden from you\. I have forgiven your wrongdoers and I have held back my sword from those who ran away\. I received everyone who came to me from among you\. If devastating matters and wrong and silly views are prompting you to break the pledge to me and to oppose me, then listen\! I have readied and saddled my horses, and if you force me to advance towards you, I shall come down in such a manner that before it the Battle of Jamal will appear like the last licking of the tongue\. At the same time, I know the high status of the obedient among you and the right of the sincere ones without confusing the sinless with the offenders of the faithful with the pledge\-breakers\.
