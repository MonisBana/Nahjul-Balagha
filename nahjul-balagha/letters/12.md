**Given to Ma\`qil Ibn Qays ar\-Riyahi as He Was Dispatched to Syria at the Command of a Vanguard Contingent of Three Thousand Strong\.**

<a id="page748"></a>Fear Allah before Whom attendance is inevitable and with other than Whom there is no meeting\. Do not fight except those who fight you\. Travel in the two cool periods \(i\.e\. morning and evening\)\. Let the men have a midday sleep\. March easily and do not travel during the early night for Allah has made it for resting and has ordained it for staying, not for journeying\. Therefore, give rest to your body in the night and let your beasts of burden also rest\. When you are sure that the morning has approached, and when dawn has drawn nigh, start your journey with Allahâ€™s blessings\. If you face the enemy, stand in the midst of your comrades\. Do not get too near to the enemy like one who wants to commence the fighting, nor should you remain too distant like one who is afraid of action, till you receive my orders\. Hatred for them should not lead you to fight before inviting them \(to guidance\) and exhausting your pleas before them\.
