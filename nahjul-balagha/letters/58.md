**Written to the People of Various Localities Describing What Took Place Between Him and the People of Siffin**

It all began thus: We and the Syrians met in an encounter although we believe in one and the same God and follow the same Prophet \(h\) and our message in Islam is the same\. We did not want them to add anything to the belief in Allah or to acknowledging His Messenger \(k\), nor did they want us to add any such things\. In fact, there was a

complete unity except that we differed on the question of shedding Othmanâ€™s blood although we were not involved in it\. We suggested to them to appease the situation by calming the temporary irritation and

<a id="page836"></a>pacifying the people till matters settled down and stabilized when we would gain strength to put matters right\.

They, however, said that they would settle it by war\. Thus, they refused our offer and consequently war spread its wings and came to stay\. Its flames rose and gained momentum\. Once the war had bitten us as well as them and pierced its talons into us as well as into them, they accepted what we had proposed to them\. So, we agreed to what they suggested and hastened to meet their request\. In this way, the plea became clear to them and no excuse was left to them\. Now, whoever among them adheres to this will be saved by Allah from ruin, and whoever shows obstinacy and insistence \(on wrong\) is the opposite: one whose heart has been blinded by Allah and evils will surround his head\.
