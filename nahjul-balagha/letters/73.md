**Letter 73**

**To Mu\`awiyah**:

In exchanging replies and listening to your letters \[as someone reads them for me\], my view has been weak and my intelligence has been erring\. When you refer your demands to me and expect me to send you written replies, you are like one who is in deep slumber while his dreams contradict him, or one who stands perplexed and overwhelmed, not knowing whether what comes to him is for him or against him\. You are not such a man but he is \(to some extent\) like you \(as you are worse than him\)\. I swear by Allah that, had it not been for \(my\) giving you time, you would have faced from me a catastrophe that would have crushed the bones and removed the flesh\. Be informed that Satan has prevented you from turning to good actions and from listening to the words of counsels\. Peace be upon those who deserve it\.
