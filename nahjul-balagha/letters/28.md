**Letter 28**

**In Reply to Mu\`awiyah, One of His Most Elegant Writings**:

Now, your letter has reached me wherein you recall that Allah chose Muhammad \(h\) for His religion and helped him through those

companions who assisted him\. Strange things about you have remained concealed \(by theirony of fate\) from us, since you have started telling us of Allah’s trials for us and His bounties through \[the kinship to\] our Prophet \(h\)\. In this regard, you are like one who carries dates to Hajar, or who challenges his own master to a duel in archery\.

<a id="page765"></a>You think that so\-and\-so are the most distinguished persons in Islam\. You have said such a thing with which, were it true, you have nothing to do, but if it is not so, then the defect in it will not affect you\. And what are you going to do with the question of who is better and who is worse, or who is the ruler and who is the ruled? What do the freed ones and their sons have to do with distinguishing between the first Muhajirun and determining their status or defining their ranks? What a pity\! The sound of an arrow is being produced by what is not a real arrow, and he against whom the judgement is to be passed is seated to judge\! O mankind\! Why do you not see your own lameness and thus remain within the bounds, and why do you not realize the shortness of your measure and stay back where destiny has placed you?\! You have no concern with the defeat of the defeated or with the victory of the victor\.

You are wandering in bewilderment, straying from the right path\. Do you not realize it? I am not giving you any news: I am just recounting Allah’s bounty, namely that a number of people from among the Muhajirun \(immigrants from Mecca\) and the Ansar \(helpers\) fell as martyrs in the way of Allah the Sublime and that each of them is distinguished \(on that account\)\. But when one of us secures martyrdom, he is named the chief of martyrs, and the Messenger of Allah grants him the special honor of saying seventy takbir \(Allahu Akbar\) during his funeral prayer\. Do you not know that a number of people lost their hands in the way of Allah and that everyone is distinguished \(on that account\)? But when the same thing takes place to one of us \[such as Ja’fer al\-Tayyar\], he is given the title “the flier in Paradise” and “the two\-winged one”? Had not Allah forbidden self \-praise, the writer would have mentioned numerous distinctions which the believer knows fully well and which the ears of the listeners do not wish to forget\.

Better leave those whose arrows miss themark\. We \[Ahl al\-Bayt \(x\)\] are the direct recipients of our Lord’s favors while others receive

favors from us after that\. In spite of our established honor and well\-known superiority over people, we did not stay away from mingling with you, intermarrying with you like equals although you are not so\. And how could you be so when \(our status is that\) among us is the Prophet \(h\)

while among you is his opponent, among us is the lion of Allah while among you is the lion of the opposing groups, among us are the two masters of the youths of Paradise while among you are the children of Hell, among us is the choicest of all the women of the worlds while among you is the bearer of firewood, any many more distinctions on our side while shortcomings \[abound\] on yours?\!

<a id="page766"></a>Our Islam is well\-known and our \(greatness in the \) pre\-Islamic period too cannot be denied\. Whatever remains has been mentioned in the words of Allah, the most Glorified One, the Sublime: “\.\.\. blood relatives have the better claim with regard to one another according to the Book of Allah” \(Holy Quran, 33: 6\)\.

He \(Allah\) the Sublime, also says the following: “Verily, of men the nearest to Abraham are surely those who followed him and this Prophet \(Muhammad \[h\]\) and those who believe, and verily, Allah, is the Guardian of the faithful” \(Holy Quran, 3: 68\)\.

Thus, we are superior firstly because of kinship and, secondly, because of obedience \[of the Almighty\]\. At the saqifa \(of Banu Sa’idah\), the Muhajirun contended kinship with the Messenger of Allah against the Ansar, scoring over them\. If that success was based on kinship, then the right will be ours better than yours; otherwise, the Ansar’s contention stands\.

You think that I have been jealous of every caliph and have revolted against them all\. Even if this is so, it is not an offence against you and, therefore, I owe you no explanation\. This is a matter for which no blame comes to you\.

You have said that I was dragged like a camel with a nose string to swear the oath of allegiance \(to Abu Bakr\) \. By the Eternal One \(Allah\), you had intended to revile me, but you have instead praised me, and you intended to humiliate me but have your own selves been humiliated\. What humiliation does it mean for a Muslim to be the victim of oppression so long as he does not entertain any doubt in his religion, nor any misgiving in his firm belief?\! This argument of mine is intended for others, but I have stated it to you only in so far as it is appropriate\.

Then you recalled my status vis\-a\-vis Othman\. In this regard, an answer is due to you because of your own kinship to him\. So \(now tell me\), which of us was more inimical to Othman and who did more to bring about his killing?\! Who offered him his support and made him sit down, stopping him? Whose help was solicited but turned his face away from the solicitor, drawing his\[Othman’s\] death near till his fate overtook him? No, no; by Allah\.

“Indeed, Allah knows those who hinder others from among you and those who say to their brethren: ‘Come here to us’ and they do not go to fight but a little” \(Holy Quran, 33: 18\)\.

<a id="page767"></a>I am not going to offer my excuse for reproaching him \[Othman\] for \(some of\) his innovations, for if my good counsel and guidance to him was \[considered by you as\] a sin, then very often a person who is blamed is no sinner at all, and sometimes the only reward a counselor reaps is suspicion \(of being an evildoer\)\. I desired naught but reform whatever I am able to \(reform\)\. “My guidance is only with Allah; On Him \(alone\) do I rely and to Him \(alone\) do I turn” \(Holy Quran, 11: 88\)\.

You have mentioned that for me and for my followers you have only the sword\.\.\. This makes even a weeping person laugh\. Did you ever see the descendants of \`Abdul\-Muttalib running away from battle, or being frightened by swords?\! “Wait a little till Hamal joins the battle shortly\.”210And my sword appeased me by killing Hudhayfah\. Then whoever you are seeking will seek you, and whoever you think to be far away will approach you\. I am \(shortly\) speeding towards you with a force of MuhajirÅn and Ansar and those who follow them in virtue\. Their number will be great and their dust will spread all around\. They will be wearing their shrouds, and their most coveted desire is to meet Allah\. They will be accompanied by the descendants of those who took part in the battle of Badr\. They will have Hashemite swords whose splitting you have already seen in the case of your brother, maternal uncle, grandfather and kinsmen\. “\.\.\. nor are they far distant from the unjust ones” \(Holy Quran, 11: 83\)\.

This letter of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib is in reply to Mu\`awiyah’s letter which he sent to Kufa through Abu Umamah al\-Bahili\. It also contains replies to some points which Mu\`awiyah had raised in his letter sent through Abu Muslim al\-Khawlani\.

210This line is a poetic reference to one Hamal ibn Badr\. The full couplet runs thus:

_Wait a little bit till Hamal reaches the battlefield;_

_How pretty death is when it comes\!_

The story behind it is that Malik ibn Zuhayr threatened Hamal ibn Badr with battle and in reply the latter recited this couplet then attacked Malik and killed him\. When Malik’s brother saw this, he killed Hamal and his brother Hudhayfah in revenge\. Then he described this incident in the following couplet:

_I appeased my heart by killing Hamal ibn Badr_

<a id="page768"></a>In Ibn Abu Umamah’s letter, Mu\`awiyah had mentioned the deputation of the Prophet \(h\) and his ascension to revelation and wrote in such a manner as though it was a matter not known to or not understood by Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and that he was in need of

being informed of it\. This is just like a stranger who may draw the map of a house for the guidance of those who dwell in it and apprize them of things already known to them\. This is why Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

has compared him to the man who carried dates to Hajar which was itself noted for abundant growth of dates\.

This is a proverb employed when someone begins to tell a person matters which he already knows better\. The basis of this proverb is that a man of Hajar, which is a town near Bahrain \(in the Persian Gulf\), went to Basra to sell goods and make purchases\. Having finished the sale, he looked about the market to make his purchases and found nothing cheaper than dates\. He, therefore, decided to purchase dates\. When he reached Hajar with his load of dates, their plentitude and cheap price there did not leave him any alternative but to store them so as to sell them later when their price would rise\. The price, however, continued to decline day after day till all the dates became rotten\. This left him nothing except their stones\. In short, after making a reference to the Prophet’s ascension to Prophethood, Mu\`awiyah recounted the distinction and merits of the three caliphs according to his view and wrote the following:

“The most distinguished among the companions and the most high ranking in the view of the Muslims was the first caliph who gathered all the Muslims under one voice, removed their disunity and fought those who were forsaking Islam\. After him is the second caliph who won victories, founded cities and humiliated the unbelievers\. Then came the third caliph who was the victim of oppression\. He propagated religion and spread the word of Allah far and wide” \(Siffin, al\-Minqari, pp\. 86\-87; Al\-Iqd al\-Farid, Vol\. 4, pp\. 334\-335; Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 15, p\. 186\)\.

Mu\`awiyah’s purpose behind bringing up this pointless warbling was to injure Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s feelings and to rouse his temper so as to make him produce such words through his tongue or pen which would so disparage the caliphs and so that he would instigate the people of Syria and Iraq against him by exploiting them\. In fact, he had already set it in the minds of these people that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had

instigated the people against Othman, had got Talhah and az\-Zubayr killed, had turned Aisha out of her house and shed the blood of thousands of Muslims\. Being unaware of the real facts, they were convinced of these

<a id="page769"></a>baseless allegations, yet to strengthen the opposition, Mu\`awiyah thought it advisable to make them believe that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) did not

recognize the achievements of the three caliphs and bore enmity and malice towards them to produce Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s writing as testimony and to use it for rousing the people of Iraq because their majority was much impressed with the environment created by the caliphs and with their greatness\. But Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) realized his

intention and gave him such a reply which put a knot in his tongue\. So, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) exposed the man’s lowliness by referring to

his enmity to Islam and to his acceptance of subjugation under force, advising him to stay within his own bounds, warning him against fixing grades of distinction among those Muhajirun who were in any case superior to him in so far as they had been in the vanguard of those who participated in the hijra \(migration from Mecca to Medna\), whereas since then, Mu\`awiyah himself was only one of those whose life had been spared \(on the day when Mecca fell in the hands of the Muslims\), he did not have the most remote respect among the MuhajirÅn\. Consequently, in the matter under discussion, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had put

Mu\`awiyah’s status as that of a false arrow among real arrows\. This is a proverb which is employed when a man boasts over persons among whom he enjoys no regard\. As regarding his statement that so\-and\-so is greater in distinction, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has, by using the

phrase “you think”, shown that it is his personal opinion which does not have the most remote regard to the truth because this word is used when a false or an unreal statement is made\.

Having refuted this claim of being the most distinguished, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) refers to these qualities and distinctions of Banu

Hashim which conspicuously demonstrate the high degree of their achievements\. Thus, the people who took part in jihad with the Prophet \(h\) and secured martyrdom attained high positions, but the distinction that fell to Hamzah by virtue of his high performance was not secured by anyone else\. The Prophet \(h\) gave him the title of “master of the

martyrs” and performed his funeral prayer fourteen times, thus raising the number of takbirs \(Allahu Akbar\) rose to seventy\. Similarly, in various battles, the hands of the fighters were cut off\. For example, in the battle of Badr, the hands of Khubayb ibn Isaf al\-Ansari and Mu’ath ibn Jabal, and in the battle of Uhud, those of \`Amr ibn al\-Jamuh as\-Salami and \`Ubayd \(Atik\) ibn at\-Tayyihan \(brother of Abul\-Haytham at\-Tayyihan\) were cut off\. But when, in the battle of Mu’tah, the hands of Ja\`far ibn Abu Talib

<a id="page770"></a>were cut off, the Prophet \(h\) singled him out by naming him “the flier in Paradise” and the “two\-winged” resident of Paradise\.

Having recounted the particular achievements of Banu Hashim, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) refers to his own attainments with which the

books of chronicles and traditions are replete and which could not be tarnished with doubts and misgivings\. Thus, traditionists like Ahmed ibn Hanbal\(164/780 \- 241/855\), Ahmed ibn Ali an Nisa’i \(215/830 \- 303/915\) and others say that: “The number of traditions which have been related through reliable sources with regard to the distinctions of Ali ibn AbÅ Talib have not been related about any other companion of the Prophet \(h\)” \(Al\-Mustadrak, Vol\. 3, p\. 107; Al\-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 3, p\. 1115; Tabaqat

al\-Hanabilah, Vol\. 1, p\. 319; Al\-Kamil, Vol\. 3, p\. 399; Tahthab al\-Tahthib, Vol\. 7, p\. 339; Fath al\-Bari, Vol\. 7, p\. 57\)\.

An important distinction out of these particular distinctions of Ahl al\-Bayt \(x\) is the one to which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) refers in

these words: “We are the direct recipients of Allah’s favors while others receive favors from us\.” This is the height of distinction that even the highest personality cannot reach its sublimity on its own, and every other distinction looks small before it\. Acknowledging the greatness and supremacy of this sentence, Ibn Abul\-Hadid writes the following: “Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) intends to convey that we \[Ahl al\-Bayt \(x\)\] are not

obligated to any person since Allah has bestowed all blessings on us directly, there being no intermediary between us and Allah, while all other people are under our obligation and protection, being the intermediary between them and Allah, the Glorified One\. This is a high status indeed\. Its apparent meaning is what the words show but its real sense is that Ahl al\-Bayt \(x\) are the obedient servants of Allah and the

people must be their obedient followers” \(Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 15, p\. 194\)\.

Now, since these people are the first recipients of the bounties of Allah and the source of bounties for the rest of the people, no one from among the people can be compared with them, nor can anyone be regarded as their equal on the basis of social contacts with them, much less than those individuals who were in direct contrast to the attainments and to the characteristics of these people and who used to oppose the truth and anything right on every occasion\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) places

both sides of the picture before Mu\`awiyah and says the following: ‘The Prophet \(h\) was one of us, while your father, Abu Sufyan, was among

<a id="page771"></a>the foremost in opposing him\. Hamzah was one of us, and the Prophet \(h\) gave him the title of Lion of Allah, while your maternal grandfather, Utbah ibn Rabi\`ah, was proud of being the lion of swearers \(against the Prophet \[h\]\)’”\.

When, in the battle of Badr, Hamzah and Utbah ibn Rabi\`ah came to face each other, Hamzah said, “I am Hamzah son of Abdul\-Muttalib; I am the lion of Allah and the lion of His Prophet \(h\)”, whereupon \`Utbah

said, “I am the lion of swearers \(against the Prophet \[h\]\)”\. In another

version, the word “asadul\-ahlaf” is recorded\. The meaning is that he was the chief of the allied parties\.

The story of swearing is that when Banu Abd Manaf acquired a distinct status among the Arab tribes, they thought they should take over from Banu Abdid \-Dar the offices relevant to the Ka\`ba and to strip them off these offices\. In this regard, Banu Abd Manaf made alliances with themselves and with these tribes: Banu Asad ibn Abdil \-Uzza, Banu Taym, Banu Zuhrah and Banu al\-Harith\. They concluded an agreement with all of them\. In order to solemnize this agreement, they drenched their hands in teeb \(perfume\) and swore that they would help each other to death\. For this reason, these tribes were called: “tribes of sworn chaste parties”\. On the other side, the tribes of Banu Abdid\-Dar, Banu Makhzum, Banu Sahm and Banu Adiy also swore that they would resist Banu Abd Manaf and their allies\. These tribes are called simply the allies\. \`Utbah has deemed himself the head of the allied parties\. Some commentators have taken the word “sadul\-ahlaf” to imply Abu Sufyan because he made different tribes swear against the Prophet \(h\) in the battle of the Trench \(Khandaq\),

while some commentators take it to mean Asad ibn Abdil\-Uzzah\. But the latter interpretation does not carry any weight because here Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) is addressing Mu\`awiyah and this interpretation does not hit Mu\`awiyah since Banu Abd Manaf were a party to this alliance\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) says, “They have among themselves the masters of

the youths of Paradise, referring to the Prophet’s saying, al\-Hassan and al\-Hussain are the masters of the youths of Paradise, while the youths of the other party are in Hell’\. This reference is to the sons of Uqbah ibn Abu Mu’eet to whom the Prophet \(h\) once said, ‘For you and your sons is

Hell’\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) says that among them is the chief of all the women of the worlds, namely Fatima az\-Zahra \(x\), while in the other party is the bearer of the wood, namely Umm Jamil, sister of Abu Sufyan\. This woman used to throw thorns in the path of the Prophet \(h\)\. She has

<a id="page772"></a>been referred to in the Holy Quran, along with Abu Lahab, in these words:

“In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful

“May both the hands of Abu Lahab perish, and may he perish, too\. His wealth will not avail him aught nor what he earns\. Soon shall he burn in the flaming Fire\. And his wife is the bearer of the firewood\. Upon her neck shall be a halter of twisted rope” \(Holy Quran, 111: 1\-5\)\.

It is narrated from Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), Umar ibn al\-Khattab, Hudhayfah ibn al\-Yaman, Abu Sa’id al\-Khudri, Abu Hurayra and others that the Holy Prophet \(h\) said the following: “Verily, Fatima \(x\) is the Supreme Lady of the women of Paradise, and al\-Hassan and al\-

Hussain are the two Supreme Youths of Paradise\. But their father \(Ali\) is Superior to them” \(Al\-Jamias\-Sahih, al\-Tirmidhi, Vol\. 5, pp\. 656, 661; Al\-Musnad, Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Vol\. 3, pp\. 3, 62, 64, 82; Vol\. 5, pp\. 391, 392; Al\-Sunan, Ibn Majah, Vol\. 1, p\. 56; Al\-Mustadrak, al\-Hakim, Vol\. 3,

1. 167; Majma’az\-Zawa’id, Vol\. 9, pp\. 183, 184, 201; Kanz al\-Ummal, al\-Muttaqi, Vol\. 13, pp\. 127, 128; Al\-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 4, p\. 1895; Usd al\-Ghaba, Vol\. 5, p\. 574; Tarikh Baghdad, Vol\. 1, p\. 140; Vol\. 6, p\. 372; Vol\. 10, p\. 230; Tarikh, Ibn Asakir, Vol\. 7, p\. 365\)\.

It is also narrated from Imran ibn al\-Hussain and Abu Tha’labah al\-Khushni that the Holy Prophet \(h\) said the following to Fatima \(x\):

“O my daughter\! Are you not satisfied that you are verily the Supreme Lady of all women of the worlds?” She said, “O father\! Then what about Maryam \(Mary\) daughter of Imran?” He said, “She was the Supreme Lady of her time while you are the Supreme Lady of all ages\. Truly, by Allah, I married you off to one who is a master in this world and in the hereafter\. No one hates him save a hypocrite” \(Hilyat al\-Awliya’, Vol\. 2, p\. 92; Al\-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 4, p\. 1895; Al\-Isaba, Vol\. 4, p\. 275\)\.

Also, Aisha narrated that the Holy Prophet \(h\) said the following: “O Fatima \(x\)\! Will you not be satisfied to be the Supreme

Lady of the women of the worlds \(or\) the Supreme Lady of all women of this umma \(community\) or of the women believers?” \(al\-Bukhari, Sahih, Vol\. 8, p\. 79; Muslim, Sahih, Vol\. 7, pp\. 142\-144; Ibn Majah, Al\-Sunan, Vol\. 1, p\. 518; Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Al\-Musnad, Vol\. 6, p\. 282; al\-Hakim, Al\-Mustadrak Ala Sahihayn, Vol\. 3, p\. 156\)\.

<a id="page773"></a>The person who goes too far in counselling others will be thought to have his personal ends in so doing, even though his counsel may well be based on sincerity of intention and selflessness\. A poetic couplet runs as follows:

How often a good counsel did I offer you, but sometimes The only reward a counsellor reaps is suspicion\.
