**Letter 20**

**To Ziyad Ibn Abih1,when Abdullah Ibn Abbas Was the Governor of Basra, the Suburbs of Ahwaz, Pars and Kirman, While Ziyad Was His Deputy in Basra\.**

207These people were Magians \(majus, Zoroastrian\)\. This is why the treatment of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s officer of them was not the same as it was with Muslims\. Disgusted with this \[discrimination\], they wrote a letter of complaint to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and spoke of the officer’s harshness\. In

reply, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) wrote to his officer that he should mete out

treatment to them in which there should be neither harshness nor such leniency which they may exploit to creating mischief\. This is so because if they are let loose, they get involved in schemes against the government, thus disturbing the country’s administration by creating one mischief or another, while a wholly repressive policy cannot be justified because they are counted as subjects and their rights as such cannot be ignored\.

208“Ibn Abih” means: “son of his \[unknown\] father”\.

<a id="page758"></a>I truthfully swear by Allah that if I come to know that you have misappropriated the funds of the Muslim, small or big amounts, I shall inflict upon you such punishment that would leave you empty\-handed, heavy backed and humiliated, and that is the end of the matter\.
