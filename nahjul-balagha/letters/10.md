**Letter 10**

**To Mu\`awiyah**

What would you do when the coverings of this world in which you are wrapped are removed from you? The world attracted you with its embellishments and deceived you with its pleasures\. It called you, and you responded to it\. It led you, and you followed it\. It commanded you, and you obeyed it\. Shortly an informer will inform you of things against which there will be no shield \(to protect you\)\. Therefore, keep off from this affair, take heed of the accounting \(on the Day of Judgement\), get ready for death that will soon overtake you, and do not lend your ears to those who have gone astray\. If you do not do so, I shall recall to you whatever you have forgotten because you are a man living in ease and luxury205\. Satan has taken you in his clutches, secured his wishes in you and taken complete control of you like your soul and blood\.

O Mu\`awiyah\! When were you ever a protector of the subjects and a guardian of the affairs of the people without granting some people distinction \(over others\)? We seek Allah’s protection against the befalling of previous misfortunes, and I warn you lest you should continue being deceived by desires and your outer appearance becomes different from your inner self\.

You have called me to war\. It is better if you left the people on one side and you yourself came out to meet me \(on the battleifield\) and thus spare both our parties having to fight\. It will then be known which one of us has a rusted heart and covered eyes\. I am the father of al\-Hassan who killed your grandfather \(\`Utbah ibn Rab\`ah\), your brother \(Hanzalah ibn Abu Sufyan\) and your uncle \(Al\-Walid ibn \`Utbah\) by cutting them to pieces on the day of Badr\. The same sword is with me, and I meet my adversary with the same heart\. I have not altered the religion, nor do I follow any new prophet\. I am surely treading on that very highway which you had willingly forsaken then was forced to adopt\.

205This is in reference to the following verse: “We sent no warner into any city except that its men who lived in ease \(and luxury\) said, ‘We disbelieve in the message with which you have been sent’” \(Holy Quran, 34: 34\)\.

<a id="page745"></a>You think that you have come out seeking revenge for Othman’s blood\. Certainly, you know how Othman’s blood was shed\. If you want to avenge it, avenge it there\. It is as though I see that when war is cutting you with its teeth, you cry like camels moaning under heavy loads\. And it is as though I see your party bewildered by the incessant striking of the swords, the occurrence of death, and the falling of bodies after bodies, calling me towards the Holy Quran although they would themselves be either unbelievers, deniers of the truth or renegades of allegiance after having sworn it\.

This previous prediction of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) is about

the battle of Siffin\. Herein, he has depicted the whole picture in very few words\. Thus, on one side Mu\`awiyah was bewildered on account of the attacks of the Iraqis and was thinking to run away while, on the other, his army was crying under the constant onslaught of death\. Eventually, when there was no way to escape, they raised the Holy Quran on the spears and shouted for peace\. By this device, the remaining persons saved their lives\.

This prediction, as ibn Abul\-Hadid al\-Mu’tazili says, “is either a true prophetic keen eye of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), which signifies a

great power, or it is an information through knowledge of the unknown \(ilmul\-ghayb\) which is the most significant and wonderful\. However, both cases are in the state of extreme significance and beauty\.

Ibn Abul\-Hadid has further quoted the same prediction from other letters of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) to Mu\`awiyah \(Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 15, pp\. 83\-85\)\.

This prediction cannot be attributed to imagination, to guessing or to the drawing of inference from events, nor can these details be ascertained by wit or far\-sightedness\. Only he could disclose them whose source of information is either the Prophet’s own revelation\-bearing tongue or the Divine inspiration\.
