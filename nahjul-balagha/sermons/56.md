**Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) Said the Following to his Companions about Mu\`awiyah:**

138After Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr had been killed, Mu\`awiyah sent Abdullah ibn Amir al\-Hadrami to Basra to exhort the people of Basra to avenge Othman’s blood because the natural inclination of most of the inhabitants of Basra and particularly Banu Tamim was towards Othman\. Consequently, he stayed with Banu Tamim\. This was the time when Abdullah ibn Abbas, the governor of Basra had gone to Kufa for condolence about Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr, leaving Ziyad ibn Ubayd \(Abih\) as his substitute\. When the atmosphere in Basra began to deteriorate, Ziyad informed Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) of all the facts\. Amir al\-

Mu’minin \(x\) tried to get Banu Tamim of Kufa ready but they kept complete silence and gave no reply\. When Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) saw this weakness and shamelessness on their part he said, “During the days of the Prophet \(h\) we did not

see whether those killed at our hands were our kith and kin, but whoever collided with Right, we were prepared to collide with him\. If we too had acted carelessly or been guilty of inaction like you then neither religion could have taken root nor could Islam prosper\. The result of this shaking was that A’yan ibn Dabi’ah al\-Mujashi’i prepared himself but on reaching Basra he was killed by the swords of the enemy\. Thereafter, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) sent off Jariyah ibn Qudamah as\-

Sa\`di with fifty men of Banu Tamim\. First he tried his best to canvass his own tribe but instead of following the right path they stooped to abusing and fighting\. Then Jariyah called Ziyad and the tribe of Azd for his help\. Soon upon their arrival \(\`Abdullah\) ibn al\-Hadrami also came out with his men\. Swords were used from both sides for some time but eventually ibn al \-Hadrami fled with seventy persons and took refuge in the house of Sabil as\-Sa\`di\. When Jariyah saw no other way he set the house on fire\. When the flames arose, they came out in search of safety but could not succeed in running away\. Some of them were crushed to death under the wall while others were killed\.

<a id="page433"></a>Soon after me a man will be placed over you with a broad mouth and a big belly\. He will swallow whatever he gets and crave what he does not get\. You should kill him but \(I know\) you will not\. He will command you to abuse me and to renounce me\. As for abusing me, you will because that would mean purification for me and salvation for you\. As regarding renunciation, you should not renounce me because I have been born on the natural religion \(Islam\) and was foremost in \(accepting\) it as well as in Hijra \(migrating from Mecca to Medina\)\.

About the person to whom Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) has alluded in

this sermon some people hold that he is Ziyad ibn Abih; some hold that he is Mughirah ibn Shu\`bah\. But most of the commentators have held him to mean Mu\`awiyah and that is correct because the qualities that Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) has described prove true on him alone\. Thus, Ibn Abul\-Hadid has written about the gluttonous quality of Mu\`awiyah that once the Prophet \(h\) sent for him and he was informed that Mu\`awiyah was busy eating\. Then the second and the third time a man was sent to call him but he brought the same news\. Thereupon, the Prophet \(h\) said,

“May Allah never satisfy his belly\. The effect of this curse was that when he felt tired of eating he would say ATake the food away, for, by Allah I am not satiated but I am tired and disgusted\. Similarly, his abusing Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) and ordering his officers for it are accepted facts of history which cannot be denied\. In this connection such words were used on the pulpit that even Allah and the Prophet \(h\) were hit by them\. Thus, Umm al\-Mu’minin Umm Salamah wrote to Mu\`awiyah, “Certainly you people abuse Allah and the Prophet \(h\) as you hurl abuses on Ali and

those who love him, while I do testify that Allah and Prophet \(h\) did love him\.”139

Thanks to \`Umar ibn Abdul\-Aziz who put an end to it and introduced the following verse in place of the way abusive of Imam Ali \(x\) in the sermons:

Verily Allah enjoins justice and benevolence \(to others\) by giving to the kindred and forbids lewdness, evil and rebellion; He exhorts you that you may take heed \(Holy Quran, 16: 90\)\.

139*Al\-Iqd al\-Farid*, Vol\. 3, p\. 131\.

<a id="page434"></a>In this sermon, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) has ordered his killing on

the basis of the Prophet’s order that “When you \(O Muslims\) see Mu\`awiyah on my pulpit, kill him\.”140
