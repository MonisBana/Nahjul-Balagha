**Sermon 167**

**Having sworn allegiance to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), some people from among the companions of the Prophet \(h\) said to him\.**

**“You should punish the people who assaulted Othman,” whereupon he said the following :**

O Brethren\! I am not ignorant of what you know, but how do I have the power for it while those who assaulted him are in the height of their power? They have superiority over us, not we over them\. They are now in the status that even your slaves have risen with them and bedouin Arabs, too, have joined them\. They are now among you and are harming you as they please\. Do you see any way to be able to do what you aim at?

This demand is certainly that of the pre\-Islamic \(jahiliyya\) period, and these folks have support behind them\. When the matter is taken up, people will have different views about it\. One group will think as you do, but another will not think as you think, and there will be still another group that will be neither this way nor that\. Be patient till people quiet down and hearts settle in their places so that rights can be achieved for people easily\. Rest assured from me and see what is given to you by me\. Do not do anything which shatters your power, weakens your strength and engenders feebleness and disgrace\. I shall control this affair as far as possible, but if I find it necessary, the last treatment will, of course, be branding with a hot iron \(through fighting\)\.
