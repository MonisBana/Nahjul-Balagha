**Praising Allah and Lauding His Prophets:**

Exalted is Allah Whom heights of daring cannot approach and fineness of intelligence cannot find\. He is such First that there is no extremity for Him so that He be contained within it, nor is there an end for Him where He will cease \(being Existent\)\.

<a id="page490"></a>**Part of the Same Sermon about the Prophet \(h\):**

Allah kept the Prophets in the best place and made them stay in the best of way\. He moved them in succession from distinguished forefathers to the wombs of chaste women\. Whenever a predecessor from among them died, the follower stood up for the cause of the religion of Allah\.

**About the Holy Prophet \(h\) and his Descendants \(Itra\):**

\.\.\. until this elevation of status by Allah, the Glorified One, reached Muhammad \(h\)\. Allah brought him out of the most

distinguished sources of origin and the most honorable places of planting, namely from the same \(lineal\) tree from which He brought forth other Prophets and from which He selected His trustees\. Muhammad’s descendants are the best descendants, his kinsmen the best of kin and his lineal tree the best of trees\. It grew in esteem and rose in distinction\. It has tall branches and unapproachable fruits\.

He is the leader \(Imam\) of all who are steadfast in your fear \(of Allah\) and the light for all those who seek guidance\. He is a lamp whose flame is burning, a meteor whose light is shining and a flint whose spark is bright\. His conduct is upright, his behavior is guiding, his speech is decisive and his decision is just\. Allah sent him after an interval from the previous Prophets when people had fallen into errors of action and ignorance\. May Allah have mercy on you\.

May Allah shower His mercy on you\! Do act according to the clear signs because the way is straight and leads to the house of safety while you are in the place of seeking Allah’s favor and have time and opportunity\. The books \(of your doings\) are open and pens \(of angels\) are busy \(to record your actions\) while your bodies are healthy, tongues are free, repentance is accepted and deeds are accorded recognition\.
