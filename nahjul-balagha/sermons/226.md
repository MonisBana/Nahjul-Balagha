**About a Companion Who Passed Away from this World Before the Occurrence of Troubles**

May Allah reward such\-and\-such man who straightened the curve, cured the disease, abandoned mischief and established the Sunnah\. He departed \(from this world\) with untarnished clothes and few

<a id="page718"></a>shortcomings\. He achieved the goodness \(of this world\) and remained safe from its evils\. He adhered to Allah’s obedience and feared Him as He deserves to be feared\. He went away leaving the people in dividing ways wherein the misled cannot obtain guidance and the guided cannot attain certainty\.

Who is this man to whom the Imam \(x\) is referring? Ibn Abul\-

Hadid has written \(in Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 14, pp\. 3\-4\) that reference here is to another \`Umar \[not to caliph \`Umar\] and that these sentences have been uttered in his praise as indicated by the word \`Umar’ written under the phrase ‘such\-and\-such’ in Sayyid ar\- Radi’s own handwriting in the manuscript of Nahjul\-Balagha which he wrote\. This man is identified in Abul\-Hadid’s statement, but it is to be seen that if Sayyid ar\-Radi had written the word \`Umar’ by way of explanation it should have existed, as other explanations by him have so remained, in those versions which have been copied from his manuscript\. Even now, there exists in Mosul University, Iraq, the oldest manuscript of Nahjul\-Balagha written by the famous calligraphist Yaqut al\-Musta’simi\. But nobody has afforded any clue to this explanation of Sayyid ar\-Radi\! Even if the view of Ibn Abul\-Hadid is accepted, it will be viewed as representative of the personal opinion of Sayyid ar\-Radi which may serve as a supplementary argument in support of an original argument\. But this personal view cannot be accorded any significance\.

It is strange how two and a half centuries after the demise of Sayyid ar\-Radi, that is, in the seventh century A\.H\., Ibn Abul Hadid should make the statement that the reference here is to \`Umar and that Sayyid ar \-Radi himself had so indicated\. The result: Some other annotaters also followed the same line\. But the contemporaries of Sayyid ar\-Radi who also wrote about Nahjul\-Balagha have given no such indication in their writings although, as contemporaries, they should have had better information about Sayyid ar\-Radi’s writing\. Thus, allama Ali ibn Nasir, who was a contemporary of Sayyid ar\-Radi and who wrote an annotation of Nahjul\-Balagha under the title A’lam Nahjul\-Balagha, writes the following with regard to this sermon: “Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has praised one of his own companions for his good conduct\. The man

had died before the troubles that arose following the death of the Prophet of Allah \(k\)\.”

This is supported by the annotations of Nahjul\-Balagha written by allama Qutbu’d\-Din ar\-Rawandi \(d\. 573 A\.H\.\)\. Ibn Abul\-Hadid \(Vol\. 14, p\. 4\) and ibn Maytham al\-Bahrani \(in Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 4, p\.

<a id="page719"></a>1. have quoted his following view: “By this man, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) refers to one of his own companions who died before the mischief and disruption that occurred following the death of the Prophet of Allah \(k\)\.”

Allama al\-Hajj al\-Mirza Habibullah al\-Khoei is of the opinion that the person under discussion is Malik ibn al\-Harith al\-Ashtar\. He bases his view on the ground that after the assassination of Malik, the situation of the Muslim community was such as Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) explains in this sermon\.”

Al\-Khoei adds that: “Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has praised

Malik repeatedly such as in his letter to the people of Egypt sent through Malik when he \[Malik\] was appointed \[by Commander of the Faithful Ali \(x\)\] as the provincial governor of Egypt\. It is similar to his utterances

when the news of Malik’s assassination reached him\. He then said the following: ‘Malik?\! Who is Malik? If Malik was a stone, he was hard and solid; if he was a rock, he was a great rock which had no parallel\. Women have become barren to give birth to such as Malik\.’ Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had even expressed in some of his utterances that ‘Malik was to

me as I was to the Holy Prophet \(h\)\.’ Therefore, one who possesses such

a status certainly deserves such attributes and even beyond that” \(Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 14, pp\. 374\-375\)\.

If these words had been about \`Umar, and if there was some trustworthiness about it, Ibn Abul\-Hadd will have recorded the authority or tradition, and it will have existed in history and been known among the people\. But here nothing is found to prove the statement except a few self \-concocted events\. Thus, about the pronouns in the words “khayraha and sharraha”, he takes them to refer to the caliphate and writes that these words can apply only to one who enjoys power and authority because without authority it is impossible to establish the Sunnah or prevent the innovation\. This is the gist of the argument which he has advanced on this occasion, although there is no proof to establish that the antecedent of this pronoun is the caliphate\. It can rather refer to the world \(when Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \[x\] says:\) “He achieved good \[of this world\] and remained

safe from its evils,” and this will be in accord with the context\. Again, to regard authority as a condition for the safeguarding of people’s interest and the propagation of the Sunnah means to close the door to prompting others to good and dissuading them from evil, although Allah has assigned this duty to a group of the people without the condition of

<a id="page720"></a>authority: “There should be among you a group \[umma\] who calls people to virtue and enjoin what is good and forbid wrong, and these shall be the successful ones” \(Holy Quran, 3: 104\)\.

Similarly, it is transmitted that the Prophet \(h\) said, “So long as

people go on promoting righteousness and dissuading evil and assisting each other in virtue and piety, they will remain in righteousness\.”

Again, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), in the course of a will, says

the following in general terms: “Establish the pillars of the Unity of Allah and the Sunnah, and keep both these lamps \[of guidance\] aflame\.”

In these sayings, there is no hint that this obligation cannot be discharged without authority\. Facts also tell us that \(despite army, force, power and authority\) the rulers could not prevent evil, nor could they propagate virtue to the extent to which some unknown godly persons were able to inculcate moral values by imprinting their morality on heart and minds, although they were not backed by any army or force, and they did not have any tools of power save their way of living in destitution\. Undoubtedly, authority and control can bend heads down before it, but it is not necessary that it should also pave the way for virtue in hearts\. History demonstrates that most of the rulers destroyed the features of Islam\. Islam’s existence and progress have been possible, thanks to the efforts of those helpless persons who possessed nothing save poverty and destitution\.

If it is emphasized that the reference here should only be to a ruler\. But why should it not be taken to refer to a companion of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) who had been a provincial governor, such as Salman al\-

Farsi for whose burial Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) made the trip all the way to al\-Mada’in, and why is it not possible that Imam Ali ibn AbÅ Talib \(x\) might have uttered these words after the burial as a comment on

his life and way of governing Mada’in? However, to believe that they are about Umar \[ibn al\-Khattab\] is without any proof whatsoever\. In the end, Ibn Abul \-Hadid quotes the following statements of \(the historian\) al\-Tabari to back his hypothesis: “It is related from al\-Mughirah ibn Shu’bah that when Umar died, Ibn Abu Khath’amah said crying, ‘O Umar\! You were the man who straightened the curve, removed the ills, destroyed mischief, revived the Sunnah, remained chaste and departed without entangling \[yourself\] in evils’\.” According to al\- Tabari, al \-Mughirah related saying, “When Umar was buried, I came to Ali and I wanted to hear something from him about \`Umar\. So, on my arrival, Imam Ali ibn

<a id="page721"></a>Abu Talib \(x\) came out in this state: He was wrapped in one cloth after

bathing and was jerking the hair of his heard and beard\. He had no doubt that the Caliphate would come to him\. On this occasion he said, ‘May Allah have mercy on Umar ibn Abu Khath’amah\. He has correctly said that he enjoyed the good things of the Caliphate and remained safe from its evils\. By Allah\! He did not say it himself but was made to say it” \(al\-Tabari, Vol\. 1, p\. 2763; Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 12, p\. 5; Ibn Kathir, Vol\. 7, p\. 140\)\.

The relater of this event is al\-Mughirah ibn Shu’bah who was saved from the penalty of having committed adultery with Umm Jamil by \`Umar \[ibn al\-Khattab\] despite the testimony against him\. His openly abusing Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) in Kufa under Mu\`awiyah’s behest

are admitted facts of history\. On this ground, what weight his statements can carry is quite clear\. From the factual point of view also, this story cannot be accepted\. Al\-Mughirah’s statement that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had no doubt about his Caliphate runs contrary to the facts\.

What were the factors from which he made this assumption when the actual facts were to the contrary? If the Caliphate was certain for anyone at the time, Othman was then the caliph\. Thus, at the Consultative Committee, Abd ar\-Rahman ibn \`Awf said to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), “O Ali\! Do not create a situation against yourself, for I have observed

and consulted the people and they all want Othman” \(al\-Tabari, Vol\. 1, p\.

2786; Ibn al\-Athir, Vol\. 3, p\. 71; Abul\-Fida’, Vol\. 1, p\. 166\)\.

Consequently, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) was sure not to be

made the caliph as has already been stated on the authority of al\-Tabari’s Tarikh, under the sermon of the Camel’s Foam \(ash\-Shaqshaqiyya\)\. In other words, on seeing the names of the members of the Consultative Committee, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) told al\-Abbas ibn \`Abdul\-

Muttalib that the caliphate could not be given to anyone except to Othman since all the powers had been given to Abd ar\-Rahman ibn \`Awf who was Othman’s brother\-in\-law \(sister’s husband\) and Sa\`d ibn Abu Waqqas was a relative and tribesman of \`Abd ar\-Rahman\. These two would collaborate to give the caliphate to him\.

At this stage, the question arises as to why al\-Mughirah urged Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) to say something about \`Umar\. If he knew that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had good impressions about Umar, he should have also known his own\. But if he thought that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) did not entertain good impressions about him, then the purpose

<a id="page722"></a>of his asking Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) to do so would be none other

than that whatever he might say he would\. By speaking his mind, an atmosphere against him would be created, and he would make the members of the Consultative Committee suspicious of him\. The views of the members of the Consultative Committee are well understood from the very fact that by putting the condition of following the conduct of the first two Caliphs for electing the caliph, they thus demonstrated their adherence to and preference of both men\. In these circumstances, when al\-Mughirah tried to play this trick, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said just

by way of relating a fact that \`Umar achieved the good \(of this world\) and remained safe from its evil\. This sentence has no connotation of praise or censure\. \`Umar did in his days enjoy all kinds of advantages, while his period was free from the mischief that cropped up soon thereafter\. Having recorded this statement, Ibn Abul\-Hadid writes the following: “From this event, the belief gains momentum that in this utterance, the allusion is towards Umar\.”

If the utterance refers to the statement of Ibn Abu Khat’amah about which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has said that they were not the

heart’s voice of the man but he was made to utter them, then there is no doubt that the reference was to \`Umar\. But the view that these words were uttered by Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) in praise of \`Umar \[ibn al\-Khattab\]

is not at all established\. Rather, from this incident, it is evidently proven that these words were uttered by Ibn Abu Khath’amah\. Allah alone knows on what ground the words of Ibn Abu Khath’amah are quoted\. Yet some people dare to argue that these words were uttered by Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) about \`Umar\.\.\.\!

It seems that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had uttered these words

about someone on some occasion, then Ibn Abu Khath’amah used similar words on Omer’s death\. Yet even then, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s words were taken to be in praise of Umar\! Otherwise, no mind except a deranged one can argue that the words uttered by Ibn Abu Khath’amah should be interpreted as being said by Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) in

praise of \`Umar\. Can it be expected, after \(a glance at\) the sermon of the Camel’s Foam, that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) might have uttered these words? Again, it is worth considering whether these words had been uttered by Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) on \`Omer’s death, then at the

Consultative Committee, when he refused to follow the conduct of the \(first\) two Caliphs, it should have been said to him that only the other day he has said that \`Umar had established the Sunnah and put an end to

<a id="page723"></a>innovations\. So, since his conduct was in agreement with the Sunnah, what was the sense in accepting the Sunnah but refusing to follow his own conduct?\!
