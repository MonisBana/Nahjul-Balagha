**About Calamities Befalling Kufa:**

O Kufa\! It is as though I see you being drawn like the tanned leather of \`Ukazi 135 in the market\. You are being scraped by calamities and being ridden by severe troubles\. I certainly136 know that if any tyrant intends evil for you Allah will afflict him with worry and fling him with a killer \(set someone on him to kill him\)\.
