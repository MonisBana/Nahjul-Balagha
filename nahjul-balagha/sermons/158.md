**Good Conduct with People, Ignoring Their Faults**

<a id="page581"></a>I lived like a good neighbor to you and tried my best to look after you\. I freed you from the snare of humbleness and the fetters of oppression through my gratefulness for the little good \(from your side\)\. I closed my eyes to your many misdeeds which my eyes had observed and my body had witnessed\.
