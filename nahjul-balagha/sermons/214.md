**A Prayer Which Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Often Recited**

Praise be to Allah Who made me such that I have not died nor am I sick, nor have my veins been infected with disease, nor have I been hauled up for my evil deeds, nor am I without progeny, nor have I forsaken my religion, nor do I disbelieve in my Lord, nor do I feel estranged with my faith, nor is my intelligence affected, nor have I been punished with the punishment of peoples before me\. I am a slave in Your possession, Lord, yet I have been guilty of excesses regarding my own soul\. You have exhausted Your pleas in my regard and I have no plea \(before You\) \. I have no power to take except what You give me, and I cannot evade except what You save me from\.

O Lord\! I seek Your protection from becoming destitute despite Your riches, from being misguided despite Your guidance, from being assaulted in Your realm and from being humiliated while authority rests with You\.

O Lord\! Let my soul be the first of the good things that You take from me and the first trust out of Your favors held in trust with me\.

O Lord\! We seek Your protection against turning away from Your command or rebellioning against Your religion, or being led away by our desires instead of by guidance that comes from You\.
