**Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Advising His Companions about Prayers**

Pledge to uphold prayers and to remain steady on it; offer prayer as much as possible and seek nearness \(to Allah\) through it because it is \(imposed\) upon the believers as a timed ordinance \(Holy Quran, 4:103\)\. Have you not heard the reply of the people of Hell when they are asked: “What has brought you into hell?” They shall say: “We were not of those who offered regular prayers\!” \(Holy Quran, 74: 42\-43\)\. Certainly, prayer drops out sins like the leaves of trees drop and removes them as ropes are removed from the necks of cattle\. The Messenger of Allah \(h\) likened it

to a flowing river at the doorstep of a person who takes a bath in it five times a day\. Will then any dirt remain on him?

Its obligation is recognized by those believers whom neither the adornment of property nor the coolness of the eyes produced by children can turn away from it\. Allah, the Glorified One, says the following: “\.\.\.

men whom neither merchandise nor any diversion distracts them from the remembrance of Allah and constancy in prayer and paying the zakat \(Qur;an, 24: 37\)\.

<a id="page678"></a>Even after receiving assurance of Paradise, the Messenger of Allah \(k\) used to exert himself for the prayers because of the command

of Allah, the Glorified One\. “\.\.\. enjoin prayer on your followers and adhere thereto steadfastly” \(Holy Quran, 20: 132\)\.

Then the Holy Prophet \(h\) used to enjoin his followers to pray and exert himself for its sake\.

**About the Islamic Tax of Zakat**

Then Islamic tax has been laid down along with prayers as a sacrifice \(to be offered\) by the followers of Islam\. Whoever pays it by way of purifying his spirit, it serves as a purifier for him, a protection and a shield against the fire \(of Hell\)\. No one, therefore, \(who pays it\) should feel attached to it afterwards, nor should he feel grieved\. Whoever pays it without the intention of purifying his heart, expecting through it to gain more \[material rewards\], he is certainly ignorant of the Sunnah; he is allowed no reward for it; his action goes to waste, and his hope for repentance is excessive\!

**Fulfillment of Trust**

As regarding the fulfillment of trust, whoever does not pay attention to it will be disappointed\. It was placed before the mighty skies, the vast earth and the high mountains, but none was found to be stronger, more vast, or higher than it\. If anything could be unapproachable because of height, vastness, power or strength, they will have been unapproachable\. But they felt afraid of the evil consequences \(of failing in fulfilling a trust\) and noticed what a weaker person did not realize it, and this was man\. “Verily, he \[man\] was \(proven\) unjust, ignorant” \(Holy Quran, 33: 72\)\.

Surely, Allah, the Glorified One, the Sublime, nothing is hidden from Him of whatever people do in their nights or days\. His knowledge encompasses all things\. Your limbs are a witness \[against you\], the organs of your body constitute an army \(against yourself\), your inner self serves Him as eyes \(to watch over your sins\) and your loneliness is open to Him\.
