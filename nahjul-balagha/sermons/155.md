**About the Malice Borne by Aisha, and Warning the People of Basra about What Was to Occur**

Whoever can at this time keep himself clinging to Allah should do so\. If you follow me I shall certainly carry you, if Allah so wills, on the path of Paradise, even though it may be full of severe hardship and of bitter taste\.

As regarding a certain woman, she is in the grip of womanly views and malice is boiling in her bosom like the furnace of the blacksmith\. If she were called upon to deal with others as she is dealing with me she will not have done it\. \(As for me\), even hereafter she will be allowed her original respect, while the reckoning \(of her misdeeds\) is an obligation of Allah\.

**Part of the same sermon:**

This path is the lightest course and the brightest lamp\. Guidance towards virtuous actions is sought through faith while guidance towards faith is achieved through virtuous actions\. Knowledge is made to prosper through faith and death is feared because of knowledge\. This world comes

<a id="page575"></a>to an end with death, while the next world is secured \(by virtuous actions\) in this world\. For people there is no escape from resurrection\. They are heading for this last end in its appointed course\.

**Part of the same sermon:**

They have got up from the resting places in their graves and have set off for the final objectives\. Every house has its own people\. They are not changed nor shifted from the re\. Commanding for good and refraining from evil are two characteristics of Allah, the Glorified\. They can neither bring death near nor lessen sustenance\.

You should adhere to the Book of Allah because it is the strong rope, a clear light, a benefiting cure, a quenching for thirst, protection for the adherent and deliverance for the attached\. It does not curve so as to need straightening and does not deflect so as to be corrected\. Frequency of its repetition and its falling on ears does not make it old\. Whoever speaks according to it, speaks truth and whoever acts by it is forward \(in action\)\.

A man stood up and said the following: “O Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\! Tell us about this disturbance and whether you inquired about it from the Holy Prophet \(h\)\.” Thereupon, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said the following:

When Allah, the Glorified sent down the verse: “Aleef laam meem \(A\.L\.M\.\) What?\! Do people imagine that they will be let off on \(their\) saying: ‘We believe\!’ and they will not be tried?\!” \(Holy Quran,

1. 1\-2\), I came to know that the disturbance will not befall us so long as the Prophet \(k\) is among us\. So I said, “O Prophet of Allah \(k\)\! What is

this disturbance of which Allah, the Sublime, has informed you?” He replied, “O Ali\! My people will create trouble after me\.” I said, “O Prophet of Allah \(k\)\! On the day of Uhud, when people had fallen

martyrs and I was not among them, and this had been very much annoying me, did you not say to me, \`Cheer up, for martyrdom is yours later on’?” The Prophet \(h\) replied, “Yes it is so, but what about you

enduring the present?” I said, “O Prophet of Allah \(k\)\! This is not an occasion for endurance, but rather an occasion for cheering up and gratitude\.” Then he said the following: “O Ali \(x\)\! People will fall into

mischief through their wealth, will show obligation to Allah on account of their faith, will expect His mercy, will feel safe from His anger and regard

<a id="page576"></a>His unlawful matters as lawful by raising false doubts and by their misguiding desires\. They will then hold lawful \(the use of\) wine by calling it barley water, a bribe by calling it a gift and taking of usurious interest by calling it sale\.” I said, “O Prophet of Allah \(k\)\! How should I

deal with them at the time, whether to hold them to have gone back in heresy or just in rebellion?” He said, “In rebellion\.”

There is no denying the fact that Aisha’s behavior towards Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) was throughout inimical and very often her heart’s

turbidity expressed itself on her face and her hatred and dislike became quite apparent, so much so that if in connection with some affair Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s name came up a frown appeared on her forehead and she did not relish pronouncing it with her tongue\. For example, when Ubaydullah ibn \`Abdillah ibn \`Utbah mentioned to Abdullah ibn Abbas thenarration by Aisha namely that Ain his death\-illness the Prophet \(h\),

taking support on al\-Fadl ibn Abbas and another person, came to her \(Aisha’s\) house, Abdullah ibn Abbas said the following: “Do you know who this Other man’ was?” He said, “No\.” Then he said, “Ali \(x\) ibn Abu

Talib, but she is averse to name him in a good context” \(Ahmed ibn Hanbal Al\-Musnad, Vol\. 6, pp\. 34, 228; Ibn Sa\`d, Al\-Tabaqat al\-Kubra, Vol\. 2, part 2, p\. 29 al\-Tabari, Tarikh, Vol\. 1, pp\. 1800\-1801\. Al\-Baladhiri, Ansab al\-Ashraf, Vol\. 1, pp\. 544\-545; al\-Bayhaqi, Al\-Sunan al\-Kubra, Vol\. 3, p\. 396\)\.

One cause for this hatred and malice was the presence of Hadrat Fatima \(x\) whose wholesome dignity and esteem pricked her heart like a thorn\. Her jealousy towards the other wives \(of the Prophet \(h\)\) did not allow her to let the Prophet \(h\) love the daughter of his other wife to

such a degree that he should stand on her approach, seat her in his own place, declare her most honorable of all the women of the world and bear such love towards her children as to call them his own sons\. All these things pained her much and naturally her feelings on such an occasion were that if she had borne children they will have been the Prophet’s sons and they will have been the pivot of the Prophet’s affection instead of Ima m Hassan and Imam Hussain\. But she was not gifted with any issue and she gratified her own desire to be a mother by adopting the surname of Umm Abdillah \(mother of the slave of Allah\) after her sister’s son\. In short all these things created the passion of hatred in her heart, as a result of which she off and on complained to the Prophet \(h\) against Fatima \(x\)

but could not succeed in diverting the Prophet’s attention from her\. News about this mortification and estrangement also reached the ears of Abu

<a id="page577"></a>Bakr\. That will only perturb him as he too could do nothing, except that his verbal sympathies were with his daughter\. At last the Prophet \(h\) left

this world and the reins of Government fell into Abu Bakr’s hands\. Now was the opportunity for him to avenge as best as he could and to perpetrate whatever violence he had in mind\. Consequently, the first step he took was that, in order to deprive Fatima \(x\) of inheritance, he denied

the principle of inheritance in the case of the prophets and held that neither do the prophets inherit nor are they inherited, but the property left by them belongs to the State\. Fatima \(x\) was so affected that she gave up

speaking to him and passed away from this world with these very feelings\. Aisha did not even take the trouble to express any sorrow at her tragic death\. Thus ibn Abul\-Hadid has written\.

When Fatima \(x\) expired all the wives of the Prophet \(h\) came

to Banu Hashim in condolence except Aisha\. She did not come and showed herself sick and words from her reached Ali which displayed her joy\. \(Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, p\. 198, Vol\. 9\)\.

As long as she bore so much malice against Fatima \(x\), how

could Fatima’s spouse be spared similar enmity and malice\. Particularly when such events also occurred which worked like a fan and roused her feeling of hatred, such as the incident of ifk when Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said to the Prophet \(h\): “She is no better than the buckles of

your shoe, leave her and divorce her\. On hearing this Aisha must have felt miserable in her bed and must have developed the severest feeling of hatred against him\. There were also moments when distinction was conferred on Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) in preference to Abu Bakr\. For instance, in connection with the dispatch of the Quranic verses on Bara’ah \(innocence\), the Prophet \(h\) removed Abu Bakr from the job, recalled

him and assigned it to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) saying that he had been commanded by Allah to take it himself or send it through a member of his family\. Similarly the Prophet \(h\) closed all the doors opening into

the mosque including that of Abu Bakr but allowed the door of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s house to continue to open\.

Aisha could not relish Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s distinction over her father and whenever there was any occasion for such distinction she did her best to undo it\. When in his last days the Prophet \(h\) ordered the

contingent under Usamah ibn Zayd to march and ordered Abu Bakr and Umar also to go under his command, they received a message from the

<a id="page578"></a>wives of the Prophet \(h\) that his condition was serious and, therefore,

the contingent should come back instead of proceeding further\. This was because their far\-reaching sight had realized that their only purpose in getting Medina vacated by the Muhajirun and the Ansar could be that after the death of the Prophet \(h\) no one should stand in Imam Ali ibn

Abu Talib’s way and that he should get the caliphate without any trouble\.

On receipt of this message the contingent under Usamah came back\.

When the Prophet \(h\) learned this he again ordered Usamah to march

with the contingent and even said, “Allah may curse him who keeps away from the contingent, whereupon they again set off, but they were again called back till the Prophet’s illness assumed serious proportions, but Usamah’s contingent did not go out as it did not want to\. After this Abu Bakr was sent word through Bilal that he should deputize the Prophet \(h\)

in leading the prayers in order to pave the way for his Caliphate\. Accordingly keeping this in view he was first shown as the Prophet’s caliph \(deputy\) in prayers and eventually was accepted as his caliph for all purposes\. Thereafter matters were so contrived that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) could not get the Caliphate\. However, after the reign of the third

caliph circumstances took such a turn that people were obliged to swear the oath of allegiance to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s hand\. On this occasion Aisha was present in Mecca\. When she learned about Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s caliphate her eyes began emitting flames and rage and anger perturbed her mind and her hatred for Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

assumed such seriousness that she rose against him on the excuse of avenging blood of the same man \(Othman\) whom she had herself proclaimed fit to be killed and openly declared war as a result of which so much bloodshed occurred that the whole land of Basra was smeared with the blood of those killed and the door of disunity was opened for good, according to Sharh, Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 9, pp\. 190\-200\.
