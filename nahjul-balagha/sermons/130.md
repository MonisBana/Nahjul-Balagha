**Grounds for Accepting the Caliphate and the Qualities of a Ruler and Governor**

O \(people of\) differing minds and divided hearts, whose bodies are present but wits are absent\. I am leading you \(amicably\) towards truthfulness, but you run away from it like goats and sheep running away from the howling of a lion\. How hard it is for me to uncover for you the secrets of justice, or to straighten the curve of truthfulness\.

O Lord\! You knows that what we did was not to seek power nor to acquire anything from the vanities of the world\. We rather wanted to restore the signs of Your religion and to usher prosperity into Your cities so that the oppressed among thy creatures might be safe and Your forsaken commands might be established\. O Lord\! I am the first who leaned \(towards You\) and who heard and responded \(to the call of Islam\)\. No one preceded me in prayer \(salat\) except the Prophet \(h\)\.

You certainly know that he who is in charge of honor, life, booty \(enforcement of\), legal commandments and the leadership of the Muslims should not be a miser as his greed will aim at their wealth\. Nor should he be ignorant as he will then mislead them with his ignorance, nor be of rude behavior who will estrange them with his rudeness\. Nor should he

<a id="page545"></a>deal unjustly with wealth thus preferring one group over another, nor should he accept a bribe while taking decisions, as he will forfeit \(othe rs\) rights and hold them up without finality, nor should he ignore Sunnah as he will ruin the people\.
