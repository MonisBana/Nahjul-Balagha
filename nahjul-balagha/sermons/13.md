**Sermon 13**

**Condemning the People of Basra**

You were the army of a woman and in the command of a quadruped\. When it grumbled you responded and when it was wounded \(hamstrung\) you fled away\. Your character is low and your pledge is broken\. Your faith is hypocrisy\. Your water is brackish\. He who stays with you is laden with sins and he who forsakes you secures Allah’s mercy\. As though I see your mosque prominent, resembling the surface of a boat, while Allah has sent chastisement from above and from below it and everyone who is on it is drowned\.

**Another version of the same sermon:**

By Allah\! Your city would certainly be drowned so much so that as though I see its mosque like the upper part of a boat or a sitting ostrich \(or, in another version of his statement\) like the bosom of a bird in the deep sea\.

**Yet Another Version States the Following:**

Your city is the most stinking of all the cities as regarding its clay, the nearest to water and remotest from the sky\. It contains nine tenths of evil\. He who enters it is surrounded with his sins and he who is out of it enjoys Allah’s forgiveness\. It seems as though I look at this habitation of yours that water has so engulfed it that nothing can be seen of it except the highest part of the mosque appearing like the bosom of a bird in the deep sea\.

Ibn Maytham writes that when the Battle of Jamal ended, three days thereafter, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) said the morning prayer in the

central mosque of Basra\. After finished it he stood on the right side of the prayer place reclining against the wall and delivered this sermon wherein he described the lowness of character of the people of Basra and they

<a id="page369"></a>slyness, namely that they got inflamed at others’ instigation without anyone of their own and making over their command to a woman clung to a camel\. They broke away after swearing allegiance and exhibited their low character and evil nature by being double\-faced\. In this sermon, the woman implies Aisha and the quadruped implies the camel \(Jamal\) after which this battle has been named the Battle of the Jamal\. This battle originated in this way\. During the lifetime of Othman, Aisha used to oppose him and had left for Mecca leaving him in siege and as such, she had a share in his assassination details of which would be stated at some suitable place but when on her return from Mecca toward Medina, she heard from Abdullah ibn Salamah that Othman’s allegiance had been paid to Ali \(as Caliph\) she suddenly exclaimed, “If allegiance has been paid to Ali, I wish the sky had burst on the earth\. Let me go back to Mecca\.” Consequently, she decided to return to Mecca and began saying, “By Allah, Othman has been helplessly killed\. I shall certainly avenge his blood\.” On seeing this wide change in the state of affairs, Abu Salamah said, “What are you saying as you yourself used to say ‘Kill this Na’thal; he had turned unbeliever’\.” Thereupon, she replied, “Not only I but everyone used to say so; but leave these things and listen to what I am now saying, that is better and deserves more attention\. It is so strange that first he was called upon to repent but before giving him an opportunity to do so, he has been killed\.” On this Abu Salamah recited the following verses addressing her:

You started it and now you are changing and raising storms of wind and rain\. You ordered for his killing and told us that he had turned unbeliever\. We admit that he has been killed but under your orders and the real killer is the one who ordered it\. Nevertheless, neither the sky fell over us not did the sun and moon fall into eclipse\. Certainly people have paid allegiance to one who can ward off the enemy with power and grandeur, does not allow swords to come near him and loosens the twist of the rope, that is, subdues his enemy\. He is always fully armed for combat and the faithful is never like the traitor\.

However, when she reached Mecca with a passion for vengeance she began rousing the people to avenge Othman’s blood by circulating stories of his having been victimized\. The first to respond to this call was Abdullah ibn Amir al\-Hadrami, who had been the governor of Mecca in Othman’s reign and with him Marwan ibn al\-Hakam, Sa’id ibn al\-As and other Umayyads rose to support her\. On the other side, Talhah ibn Ubaydillah and az\-Zubayr ibn al\-Awwam also reached Mecca from Medina\. From Yemen Ya\`li ibn Munabbih who had been governor there during Othman’s caliphate and the former governor of Basra, Abdullah

<a id="page370"></a>ibn Amir ibn Kurayz also reached there and joining together began preparing their plans\. The battle had been decided upon but the discussion was about he venue of confrontation\. Aisha’s opinion was to make Medina the venue of the battle but some people opposed and held that it was difficult to deal with Medinites and that some other place should be chose as the venue\. At last after much discussion it was decided to march towards Basra as there was no dearth of men to support the cause\. Consequently on the strength of Abdullah ibn Amir’s countless wealth and the offer of six hundred thousand Dirhams and six hundred camels by Ya\`li ibn Munabbih they prepared any army of three thousand and set off to Basra\. There was a small incident on the way of account of which Aisha refused to advance further\. What happened was that at a place she heard the barking of dogs and inquired from the camel driver the name of the place\. He said it was Haw’ab\. On hearing this name, she recalled the Prophet’s admonition when he ha said to his wives, AI wish I could know at which of you the dogs of Haw’ab would bark\. So when she realized that she herself was the one, she got the camel seated by patting and expressed her intention to abandon themarch\. But the device of her companions saved the deteriorating situation\. Abdullah ibn az\-Zubayr swore to assure her that it was not Haw’ab, Talhah seconded him and for her further assurance, also sent for fifty persons to testify to it\. When all of the people were on one side, what could a single woman do by opposing\. Eventually they were successful and Aisha resumed her forward march with the same enthusiasm\.

When this army reached Basra, people were first amazed to see the riding animal of Aisha\. Jariyah ibn Qudamah came forward and said, “O, Mother of the faithful, the assassination of \`Othman was one tragedy but the greater tragedy is that you have come out on this cursed camel and ruined your honor and esteem\. It is better that you should get back\. But since neither the incident at Haw’ab could deter her nor could the Quranic injunction: “Keep sitting in your houses \(33: 33\) stop her,” what effect could these voices produce\. Consequently, she disregarded all of this\.

When the army tried to enter the city, the governor of Basra Othman ibn Hunayf came forward to stop them and when the two parties came face\-to\-face, they drew their swords out of the sheaths and pounced upon each other\. When a good number had been killed from either side, Aisha intervened on the basis of her influence and the two groups agreed that until the arrival of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\), the existing administration

should continue and Othman ibn Hunayf should continue on his post\. But only two days had elapsed when they made a nightly attack on Othman ibn Hunayf, killed forty innocent persons, beat Othman ibn Hunayf,

<a id="page371"></a>plucked every hair of his bread, took him in their custody and shut him u, p\. Then they attacked the public treasury and while ransacking it, killed twenty persons on the spot and beheaded fifty more after arresting them\. Then they attacked the grain store whereupon an elderly noble of Basra, Hukaym ibn Jabalah, could not control himself and reaching there with his men said to Abdullah ibn az\-Zubayr, ASpare some of this grain for the city’s populace\. After all there should be a limit to oppression\. You have spread killing and destruction all around and put Othman ibn Hunayf in confinement\. For Allah’s sake, keep off these ruining activities and release Othman ibn Hunayf\. Is there no fear of Allah in your hearts? ibn az\-Zubayr said, “This is vengeance of Othman’s life\. Hukaym ibn Jabalah retorted, AWere those who have been killed assassins of Othman? By Allah, if I had supporters and comrades I should have certainly avenged the blood of these Muslims whom you have killed without reason\. Ibn az\-Zubayr replied, “We shall not give anything out of this grain, nor will Othman ibn Hunayf be released\. At last, the battle raged between these two parties but how could a few individuals deal with such a big force? the result was the Hukaym ibn Jabalah, his son al\-Ashraf ibn Hukaym ibn Jabalah, his brother ar\-Ri’l ibn Jabalah and seventy persons of his tribe were killed\. In short, killing and looting prevailed all around\. Neither anyone’s life was secure nor was there any way to save one’ honor or property\.

When Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) was informed of themarch to Basra,

he set out to stop it with a force which consisted of seventy of those who had taken part in the battle of Badr and four hundred out of those companions who had the honor of being present at the Allegiance of Ridwan \(The Divine Pleasure\)\. When he stopped at the stage of Khaqar, he sent his son Hassan \(x\) and “\`Ammar ibn Yasir to Kufa to invite its

people to fighting\.” Consequently, despite interference of Abu Musa al\-Ash\`ari seven thousand combatants from there joined Amir al\-Mu’minin’s army\. He left that place after placing the army under various commanders\. Eye witnesses state that when his force reached near Basra first of all a contingent of Ansar appeared foremost\. Its standard was held by Abu Ayyub al\-Ansari\. After it appeared, another contingent of 1,000 whose commander was Khuzaymah ibn Thabit al\-Ansari\. Then another contingent came in sight\. Its standard was borne by Abu Qatadah ibn ar\-Rabi’\. Then a crowd of a thousand old and young persons was seen\. They had signs of prostration on their foreheads and veils of fear of Allah on their face\. It seemed as if they were standing before the Divine Glory of the Day of Judgment\. Their commander rode a dark horse, was dressed in white, had a black turban on his head and was reciting the Holy Quran

<a id="page372"></a>loudly\. This was \`Ammar ibn Yasir\. Then another contingent appeared\. Its standard was in the hand of Qays ibn Sa\`d ibn Abadah\. Then an army came to sight\. Its leader wore white outfit and hade a black turban on this head\. He was so handsome that all eyes centered around him\. This was Abdullah ibn Abbas\. Then followed a contingent of the companions of the Prophet \(h\)\. Their standard bearer was Othman ibn Abbas\. Then after

the passing of a few contingents, a big crowd was seen wherein there was such a large number of spears that they were overlapping and flags of numerous colors were flying\. Among them, a big and lofty standard was seen with a distinctive status\. Behind it was seen a rider guarded by sublimity and greatness\. His sinews were well\-developed and his eyes were cast downwards\. His awe and dignity was such that no one could look at him\. This was the ever victorious Lion of Allah namely Ali, Ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\. On his right and left were Hassan and Hussain \(peace be

upon them\)\. In front of him Muhammad ibn al\-Hanafiyya walked in slow steps carrying the banner of victory and glory and on the back were young men of Banu Hashim, the people of Badr and \`Abdullah ibn Ja\`far ibn Abu Talib\. When this army reached the place az\-Zawiyah, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) alighted from the horse\. After performing a four rak’at

prayer, he put his cheeks on the ground\. When he lifted his head, the ground was drenched with tears and his tongue was uttering these words:

O Sustainer of earth, heaven and the high firmament\! This is Basra\. Fill our lap with its good and protect us from its evil\.

Then proceeding forward he got down in the battlefield of Jamal where the enemy was already camping\. First of all, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)

announced in his army that no one should attack another nor take the initiative\. Saying this he came in front of the opposite army and said to Talhah and az\-Zubayr, “You ask Aisha by swearing in the name of Allah and His Prophet \(h\) whether I am not free from the blame of Othman’s

blood and whether I used the same words for him which you used to say and whether I pressed you for allegiance or you swore it of your own free will\.” Talhah got exasperated at these words but az\-Zubayr relented\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) turned back after it and giving the Holy Quran to Muslim

\(a young man from the tribe of Abd Qays sent him toward them to pronounce to them the verdict of the Holy Quran\. But people took both of them within aim and covered this godly man with their arrows\. Then Ammar ibn Yasir went to canvass and convince them and caution them with the consequences of war but his words were also replied by arrows\.

<a id="page373"></a>Until now, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) had not allowed an attack as a result of

which the enemy continued feeling encouraged and went on raining arrows constantly\. At last, with the dying of a few valiant combatants consternation was created among Amir al\- Mu’minin’s ranks and some people came with a few bodies before him and said, “O Commander of the Faithful\! You are not allowing us to fight while they are covering us with arrows\. How long can we let them make our bosoms the victim of their arrows and remain hand folded at their excesses? At this, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) did show anger but acting with restraint and endurance

came to the enemy in that very form without wearing armor or any arm and shouted, “Where is az\-Zubayr?\!” At first az\-Zubayr hesitated to come forward but he noticed that Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) had no arms so he

came out\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) said to him “O az\-Zubayr\! You must remember that one day the Prophet \(h\) told you that you would fight with me and wrong and excess would be on your side\.” Az\-Zubayr replied that he had said so\. Then Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) inquired AWhy

have you come then?” He replied that his memory had missed it and if he had recollected it earlier he would not have come that way\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) said, “Well now you have recollected it” and he replied,

“Yes\.” Saying this he went straight to Aisha and told her that he was leaving\. She asked him the reason and he replied, “Ali has reminded me a forgotten matter\. I had gone astray, but now I have come on the right path and would not fight Ali ibn Abu Talib at any cost\.” Aisha said, “You have caught the fear of the swords of the sons of \`Abdul\-Muttalib\.” He said, “No” and saying this, he turned the reins of his horse\. However, it is gratifying that some consideration was accorded to the Prophet’s saying, for at Haw’ab even after recollection of the Prophet’s words no more than a transient effect was taken of it\. On returning after this conversation, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) observed that they had attacked the right and left

flanks of his army\.” Noticing this, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) said, “Now the plea has been exhausted\. Call my son Muhammad\.” When he came Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) said, “My son, attack them now\. Muhammad bowed his

head and taking the standard proceeded to the battlefield\.” But arrows were falling in such exuberance that he had to stop\. When Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) saw this, he called out at him, “Muhammad\! Why do not you advance?” He said, “Father, in this shower of arrows, there is not way to proceed\. I will wait till the violence of arrows subsides\.” The Imam \(x\)

said, “No, thrust yourself in the arrows and Muhammad ibn al\-Hanafiyya advanced a little surrounded him that he had to hold his steps\. On

spears and attack\.” but the archers so seeing this a frown

<a id="page374"></a>appeared on Amir al\-Mu’minin’s forehead and said, “This is the affect of your mother’s veins\. Saying this he took the standard from his hands and folded up his sleeves and made such an attack that a tumult was created in the enemy’ ranks from one end to the other\. To which ever row he turned, it became clear and to whatever side he directed himself, bodies were seen falling and heads rolling in the hoofs of horses\. When after convulsing the rows, he returned to his status and said to Muhammad ibn al\-Hanafiyya, “Look, my son\! Battles are fought like this\.” Saying this, he gave the standard to him and ordered him to proceed\. Muhammad advanced toward the enemy with a contingent of Ansar\. The enemy also came out moving and balancing their spears\. But the brave son of the valiant father convulsed rows over rows while the other warriors made the battlefield glory and left heaps of dead bodies\.

From the other side, there was a full demonstration of the spirit of sacrifice\. Dead bodies were falling one over the other, but they continued sacrificing their lives devotedly around the camel\. Particularly, the condition of Banu Dabbah was that although their hands were being severed from the elbows for holding the reins of the camel and bosoms were being pierced yet they had the following battle song on their tongues:

To us, death is sweeter than honey\. We are Banu Dabbah, camel rearers\. We are sons of death when death comes\. We announce the death of Othman with the edges of spears\. Give us back our chief and there is an end to it\.

The low character and ignorance from faith of these Banu Dabbah can be well understood by that one incident which al\-Mada’ini has narrated\. He writes that in Basra there was a man with a mutilated ear\. He asked him its reason when he said, “I was watching the sight of dead bodies in the battlefield of Jamal when I saw a wounded man who sometimes raised his head and sometimes dashed it back on the ground\. I approached near\.” Then, the following two verses were on his lips:

Our mother pushed us into the deep waters of death and did not get back till we had thoroughly drunk\.

By misfortune, we obeyed\. Banu Taym who are none but slave men and slave girls\.

I told him it was not the time to recite verses; he should rather recall Allah and recite the kalima \(shahada\) \(verse of testimony\)\. On my

<a id="page375"></a>saying this he gave me an angry look and uttering a sever abuse said, “You are asking me to recite the kalima, get frightened at the last moment and show impatience? I was astonished to hear this and decided to return without saying anything further\. When he saw me returned he said, “Wait, for your sake I am prepared to recite, but teach me\. I drew close to teach him the kalima when he asked me to get closer\. When I got closer, he caught my ear with his teeth and did not leave it till he tore it from the root\. I did not think it proper to assault a dying man and was about to get back abusing and cursing him when he asked me to listen to one more thing\. I agreed to listen lest he had an unsatisfied wish\. He said that when I should get to my mother and she inquired who had bitten my ear, I should say that it was done by \`Umayr ibn al\-Ahlab ad\-Dabbi who had been deceived by a woman aspiring to become the commander of the faithful \(head of state\)\.

However, when the dazzling lightning of swords finished the lives of thousand of persons and hundreds of Banu Azd and Banu Dabbah were killed for holding the rein of the camel\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)

ordered, “Kill the camel, for it is Satan\.” Saying this, he made such a severe attack that the cries of ‘Peace\!’ and ‘Protection\!’ rose from all around\. When he reached near the camel he ordered Bujayr ibn Buljah to kill the camel at once\. Consequently, Bujayr hit it with such might that the camel fell in agony on the side of its bosom\. No sooner than the camel fell, the opposite army took to heels and the carrier holding Aisha was left lonely and unguarded\. The companions of Amir la\-Mu’minin took control of the carrier and under orders of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\), Muhammad ibn

Abu Bakr escorted Aisha to the house of Safiyya daughter of al\-Harith\.

This encounter commenced on the 10th of Jumada II, 36 A\.H\. in the afternoon and came to and end the same evening\. In it from Amir al\-Mu’minn’s army of twenty two thousand, one thousand and seventy or according to another version, five hundred persons were killed as martyrs while from Aisha’s army of thirty thousand, seventeen thousand persons were killed and the Prophet’s saying, “That people who assigned their affairs \(of state\) to a woman would never prosper was fully corroborated\.” \(Al\-Imama wal\-Siyasa; Muruj al\-Dhahab; al\-\`Iqd al\-Farid; al\-Tabari’s Tarikh\)\.

1. Ibn Abul\-Hadid has written that as prophesied by Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\), Basra got under the floods twice, once during the days of

al\-Qadir Billah, and once during the reign of al\-Qa’im bi Amrillah\. The condition of flooding was such that the whole city was submerged, but the

<a id="page376"></a>top ends of the mosque were seen about in the surface of the water and looked like a bird encroaching on its bosom’s side\.
