**When Amir Al\-Mu’minin \(x\) Announced His Intention to**

**Fight the Kharijites, He Was Told That They Had Crossed the Bridge of Nahrawan and Gone over to the Other Side\. It Was Then That Amir Al\-Mu’minin \(x\) Said the Following:**

Their falling place is on this side of the river\. By Allah, not even ten of them will survive while from your side not even ten will be killed\.142
