**Treason and Treachery of Mu\`awiyah and the Fate of Those Guilty of Treason**

By Allah, Mu\`awiyah is not more shrewd than I am, but he deceives and commits evil deeds\. Had I not been hateful of deceitfulness, I will have been the most cunning of all men\. But \(the fact is that\) deceit is a sin and sin is disobedience \(of Allah\)\. Every deceitful person will have a banner by which he will be recognized on the Day of Judgement\. By Allah, I cannot be made forgetful by strategy, nor can I be overpowered by hardships\.

People who are ignorant of religion and its ethics, free from the shackles of religious laws and unaware of the concept of punishment and reward find abundance of excuses, methods and means for the achievement of their objectives\. They can find ways to succeed at every stage\. But when they find the dictates of humanity, or Islam, or the limitations imposed by ethics and religious laws as impeding their designs, their chances of devising and finding vile means become narrow and the possibility of their action becomes limited\. Mu\`awiyah’s influence and control was the result of these devices and ways in which he knew no impediment nor any obstacle of what is lawful or unlawful, nor did the fear of the Day of Judgement prevent him from acting defiantly\. Describing the character of Mu\`awiyah, allama ar\-Raghib al\-Isfahani writes the following: “His aim was always to achieve his objective whether lawful or unlawful\. He did not care for religion, nor did he ever think of the Divine chastisement\. Thus, in order to maintain his power, he resorted to false statements and concoctions, practiced all sorts of deceit and contrivance\. When he saw that success was not possible without entangling Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) in war, he roused Talhah

and az\-Zubayr against him\. When success could not be achieved by this means, he instigated the Syrians, bringing about the civil war of Siffin\. And when the status of his rebellion became exposed through the killing of Ammar, he at once duped the people by saying that Ali was responsible for killing him as he had brought him into the battlefield\. And on another occasion, he interpreted the words ‘rebellious party’ in the hadith of the Prophet \(h\) to mean ‘avenging party’, trying desperately to prove that

Ammar would be killed by the group that would seek revenge of Othman’s blood, although the next portion of this statement, that is, ‘he will call them towards Paradise while they will call him to Hell’, does not leave any room for interpretation\. When there was no hope of victory

<a id="page680"></a>even by these cunning means, he contrived to raise the Holy Quran on the spears, although in his view neither the Holy Quran nor its commandments carried any weight\. If he had really aimed at deriving a decision from the Holy Quran, he should have put this demand before the commencement of the battle\. When it became known to him that the decision had been secured by \`Amr ibn al\-As by deceiving Abu Musa al\-Ash\`ari and that it did not have even a remote connection with the Holy Quran, he should not have accepted it and should have punished \`Amr ibn al\-As for this cunning or at least warned and rebuked him\. But on the contrary, the latter’s performance was much appreciated and, in reward, he was made the Governor of Egypt\.

In contrast to this outrage, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s conduct was a high specimen of religious law and ethics\. He kept in view the requirements of truth and righteousness even in adverse circumstances and did not allow his virtuous life to be tarnished by the views of deceit and contrivance\. If he wished, he could face cunning by cunning and Mu\`awiyah’s shameful activities could have been answered by similar measures\. For example, when he posted guards on the Euphrates and stopped the supply of its water \(to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s men\), then the supply of water could have been cut off from them also on the grounds that since they had occupied the Euphrates, it was lawful to retaliate\. In this way, they could be overpowered by weakening their fighting power\. But Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) could never tarnish his

hands with such an inhuman deed which was not permitted by any law or code of ethics, although common people regard such deeds against the enemy as lawful and call this duplicity of character for the achievement of success as a normal policy and administrative ability\. But Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) could never think of strengthening his power by fraud or

duplicity of behavior on any occasion\. Thus, when people advised him to retain the officers who had been appointed during the government of Othman and to befriend Talhah and az\-Zubayr by assigning them governorship of KÅfa and Basra and make use of Mu\`awiyah’s ability in administration by giving him the government of Syria\.\.\., Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) rejected this advice and preferred the commandments of the

religious law over worldly expediency and openly declared about Mu\`awiyah as follow: “If I allow Mu\`awiyah to retain what he already has, I will be one who takes those who lead \(people\) astray as helpers” \(refer to Holy Quran, 18: 51\)\.\.

Those who look at apparent successes do not care to find out by what means the success has been achieved\. They support anyone whom

<a id="page681"></a>they see as succeeding by means of cunning and deception, and they begin to regard him an administrator, a man of intelligence, a politician, an intellectually brilliant man \.\.\., and so on, while whoever does not deploy cunning and fraudulent methods due to his adherence to Islamic commandments and the Divine instructions and prefers failure over success secured through wrong methods is regarded as ignorant of politics and weak in foresight\. They do not feel it necessary to think what difficulties and impediments exist in the way of a person who adheres to principles and laws which prevent him from proceeding forward even after approaching near success\.
