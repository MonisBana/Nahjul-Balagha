**About Steadfastness on the Battlefield**

In the company of the Prophet of Allah \(h\), we used to fight our

parents, sons, brothers and uncles\. This continued us in our faith, in submission, in our following the right path, in endurance over the pangs of pain and in our fight against the enemy\. A man from our side and one

<a id="page432"></a>from the enemy would pounce upon each other like energetic men contesting as to who would kill the other; sometimes our man gets over his adversary and sometimes the enemyâ€™s man gets over ours\.

When Allah had observed our truth He sent ignominy to our foe and sent His succor to us till Islam was established \(like the camel\) with its neck on the ground and resting in its place\. By my life, if we had also behaved like you, no pillar of \(our\) religion could have been raised, nor the tree of faith could have borne leaves\. By Allah, certainly you will now milk our blood \(instead of milk\) and eventually you will face shame\.138
