**About Those Who Give up Supporting Right**

O Lord\! Whoever listens to our utterance, which is just and which seeks the prosperity of religion and the worldly life, and who does not seek mischief, but rejects it after listening, then he certainly turns away from Your support and desists from strengthening Your religion\. We implore You to be the witness over him, and You are the greatest of all witnesses, and we make all those who inhabit Your earth and skies witness over him\. Thereafter, You alone can make us needless of his support and question him about his sin\.
