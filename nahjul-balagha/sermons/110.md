**Cautioning about this World :**

So now, certainly I frighten you from this world for it is sweet and green, surrounded by lusts and liked for its immediate enjoyments\. It excites wonder with small things, is ornamented with \(false\) hopes and decorated with deception\. Its rejoicing does not last and its afflictions cannot be avoided\. It is deceitful, harmful, changing, perishable, exhaustible, liable to destruction, gnawing and destructive\. When it reaches the extremity of desires of those who incline towards it and feel happy with it, the status is just what Allah, the most Glorified One, says \(in the Holy Quran\):

\.\.\. like water which We send down from the heavens and the herbage of the earth mingles with it, then it becomes dry stubble which the winds scatter; for Allah over all things has power\. \(Holy Quran, 18: 45\)

Nobody rejoices about this world except that tears come to him after it, and no one enjoys its comforts except that he has to face hardships in thereafter\. No one receives the light rain of ease in it but the

<a id="page511"></a>heavy rain of distress pours upon him\. It is worthy of this world that in the morning it supports a man but in the evening it does not recognize him\. If one side of it is sweet and pleasant the other side is bitter and distressing\.

No one secures enjoyment from its freshness but he has to face hardship from its calamities\. No one will pass the evening under the wing of safety but that his morning will be under the feathers of the wing\-tip of fear\. It is deceitful and all that is the rein is deception\. It is perishable and all that is on it is to perish\. There is no good in its provisions except in piety\. Whoever takes little from it collects much of what will give him safety, while one who takes much from it takes much of what will ruin him\. He will shortly depart from his collection\. How many people relied on it but it distressed them; \(how many\) felt peaceful with it but it made them tumble; how many were prestigious but it made them low and how many were proud but it made them disgraceful\.

Its authority is changing\. Its life is dirty\. Its sweet water is bitter\. Its sweetness is like myrrh\. Its food are poisons\. Its means are weak\. The living in it are exposed to death; the healthy in it are exposed to disease\. Its realm is \(liable to be\) snatched away\. The strong in it are \(liable to be\) defeated and the rich are \(liable to be\) afflicted with misfortune\. The neighbor in it is \(liable to be\) plundered\.

Are you not \(residing\) in the houses of those before you, who were of longer ages, better traces, had bigger desires, were more in numbers and had greater armies? How they devoted themselves to the world and how they showed preference to it\! then they left it without any provision that could convey them through, or the back \(of a beast for riding\) to carry them\.

Did you get the news that the world was ever generous enough to present ransom for them, or gave them any support or afforded them good company? It rather inflicted them with troubles, made them languid with calamities, assaulted them with catastrophes, threw them down on their noses, trampled them under hoofs and helped the vicissitudes of time against them\. You have observed its strangeness towards those who went near it, acquired it and appropriated it, till they departed from it for good\. Did it give them any provision other than starvation, or make them stay in other than narrow places, or give them light other than gloom, or give them in the end anything other than repentance? Is this what you ask for so much or remain satisfied with, or towards which you feel greedy? How bad is this abode for him that he did not suspect it \(to be so\) and did not entertain fear from it?

<a id="page512"></a>You should know, as you do know, that you have to leave it and depart from it\. While in it, take lesson from those Awho proclaimed “who is more powerful than us?’ \(Holy Quran, 41: 15\), but they were carried to their graves, though not as riders\. They were then made to stay in the graves, but not as guests\. Graves were made for them from the surface of the ground\. Their shrouds were made from earth\. Old bones were made their neighbor\. They are neighbors who do not answer a caller nor ward off trouble, nor pay heed to a mourner\.

If they get rain they do not feel happy and if they face famine they do not get disappointed\. They are together but each one apart\. They are close together but do not see each other\. They are near but do not meet\. They are enduring and have no hatred\. They are ignorant and their malice has died away\. There is no fear of trouble from them and no hope of their warding off \(troubles\)\. They have exchanged the back \(surface\) of the earth with its stomach \(interior\), vastness with narrowness, family with loneliness and light with darkness\. They have come to it \(this world\) as they had left it with bare feet and naked bodies\. They departed from it with their acts towards the continuing life and everlasting house as Allah has said the following:

\.\.\. As we caused the first creation, so will We cause its return\. \(It is\) a promise binding Us, verily We were doing it\. \(Holy Quran, 21: 104\)
