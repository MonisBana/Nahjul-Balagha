**Sermon 143**

**Deputation of the Prophet \(h\)**

Allah deputed prophets and distinguished them with His revelation\. He made them as pleas for Him among His creation, so that there should not remain any excuse for people\. He invited people to the right path through a truthful tongue\. You should know that Allah fully knows creation\. Not that He was not aware of what they concealed from among their hidden secrets and inner feelings, but in order to try them as to whom from among them performs good deeds, so that there is reward with regard to good deeds and chastisement with regard to evil acts\.

<a id="page558"></a>**The status of Ahl al\-Bayt \(x\) \(the Household of the Holy Prophet \[h\]\)**

Where are those who falsely and unjustly claimed that they are deeply versed in knowledge, as against us, although Allah raised us in status and kept them down, bestowed upon us knowledge but deprived them and entered us \(in the fortress of knowledge\) but kept them out\. With us guidance is to be sought and blindness \(of misguidance\) is to be changed into brightness\. Surely Imams \(the Divine leaders\) will be from the tribesmen of Quraish\. They have been planted in this line through Hashim\. It will not suit others nor will others be suitable as heads of affairs\.

**Part of the same sermon about those who are against Ahl al\-Bayt \(x\)\.**

They have adopted this world and abandoned the next world; left clean water and drunk stinking water\. I can almost see their wicked one1 who committed unlawful acts, associated himself with them, befriended them and accorded with them till his hair became gray and his nature acquired their tinge\. He proceeded onward emitting foam like a torrential stream not caring whom he drowned, or, like fire in straw, without realizing what he burnt\.

Where are the minds which seek light from the lamps of guidance and the eyes which look at minarets of piety? Where are the hearts dedicated to Allah and devoted to the obedience of Allah? they are all crowding towards worldly vanities and quarreling over unlawful issues\. The ensigns of Paradise and Hell have been raised for them but they have turned their faces away from Paradise and proceeded to Hell by dint of their performances\. Allah called them but they showed dislike and ran away\. When Satan called them they responded and proceeded \(towards him\)\.

The reference stated above is to Abdul\- Malik ibn Marwan who committed extreme atrocities through his officer al\-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf ath\-Thaqafi\.
