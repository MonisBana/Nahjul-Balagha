**When Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Appointed Muhammad Ibn Abu Bakr as the Ruler of Egypt, and the Latter Was Overpowered and Killed, Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Said the Following:**

He had intended to send Hashim ibn Utbah to Egypt and had I done so he would have neither made a way for the opponents nor given them time \(to get hold of him\)\. This is without reproach to Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr as I loved him and had raised him\.

Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr’s mother was Asma’ daughter of Umays whom Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) married after Abu Bakr’s death\. Consequently, Muhammad \(h\) lived and was brought up under the care of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and he imbibed his ways and manners\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) loved him and regarded him as his son, saying, “Muhammad \(h\) is my son from Abu Bakr\. He was born in the journey during the last Hajj \(of the Prophet \(h\)\) and died as a martyr in 38 A\.H\. at the age of twenty eight years\.

On accession to the Caliphate, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had

selected Qays ibn Sa\`d ibn Abadah as the Governor of Egypt but circumstances developed so that he had to be removed\. Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr was then sent there as Governor\. The policy of Qays there was that he did not want to take any serious step against the Othman group but Muhammad’s view was different\. After the lapse of a month he sent them word that in case they did not obey him their existence there would be impossible\. Upon this these people organized a front against him and engaged themselves in secret wire pulling, but became conspicuous soon\. After arbitration they started creating trouble with the slogan of vengeance\. This polluted the atmosphere of Egypt\. When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) came to know these deteriorated conditions he gave the

governorship of Egypt to Malik ibn al\- Harith al\- Ashtar and sent him off there in order that he might suppress insurgent elements and save the administration from getting worse\. Yet, he could not escape the evil designs of the Umayyads and was killed by poison while on his way\. Thus, the governorship of Egypt remained with Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr\.

<a id="page445"></a>On this side, the performance of Amr ibn al\-As in connection with the arbitration made Mu\`awiyah recall his own promise\. Consequently, he gave him six thousand combatants and set him off to attack Egypt\. When Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr knew of the advancing force of the enemy he wrote to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) for help\.

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) replied that he would be soon collecting help

for him but in the meantime he should mobilize his own forces\. Muhammad mobilized four thousand men under his banner and divided them into two formations\. He kept one part with himself and on the other he placed Kinanah ibn Bishr at\-Tujibi in command and ordered him to go forward to check the enemy’s advance\. When they settled down to camp before the enemy, various parties of the enemy began attacking them\. Yet, they faced them with courage and valour\. At last, Mu\`awiyah ibn Hudayj as\-Sikuni al\-Kindi made an assault with full force\. These people did not turn away from the enemy’s swords but faced them steadfastly and fell as martyrs in action\. The effect of this defeat was that Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr’s men got frightened and deserted him\. Finding himself alone, Muhammad fled and sought refuge in a deserted place\. The enemy however got news about him through someone and traced him out when he was dying with thirst\. Muhammad asked for water but these cruel men refused and butchered him thirsty\. Then they put his body in the belly of a dead ass and burnt it\.

Malik ibn Ka\`b al\-Arhabi had already left Kufa with two thousand men, but before he could reach Egypt it had been occupied by the enemy\.
