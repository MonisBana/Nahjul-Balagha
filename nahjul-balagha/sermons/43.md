**After Amir Al\-Mu’minin \(x\) Had Sent Jarir Ibn Abdillah Al\-**

**bajali to Mu\`awiyah \(For Securing His Oath of Allegiance\), Some of His Companions Suggested Preparation to Fight with Him\. Then He Said:**

My preparation for war with the people of Syria while Jarir ibn Abdillah al\-Bajali is still there would be closing the door on Syria and thereby preventing its people from a good action \(i\.e\. allegiance\) if that indeed was their intention\. However, I have fixed a time limit of Jarir after which he would not stay without either deception or in disobedience\.

<a id="page424"></a>My opinion is in favor of patience, so wait a while\. \(In the meantime\) I do not dislike your preparation\.

I have observed this matter thoroughly from all sides but I do not find any way except war or heresy\. Certainly, there was a ruler over the people \(before me\) who brought about new \(un\-Islamic\) things and compelled the people to speak out\. So they did speak, then rose and changed the whole system\.
