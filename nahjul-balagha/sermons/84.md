**About the Perfection of Allah and Counseling**

I testify that there is no god but Allah, He is One and there is no partner with Him\. He is the First, such that nothing was before Him\. He is the Last, such that there is no limit for Him\. Imagination cannot catch any

149Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) here refers to the incident when the

Conqueror of Egypt, Amr ibn al\-As, exhibited the “feat of his courage” by displaying his private parts\! What happened was that when in the battlefield of Siffin he and Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had an encounter, he rendered himself naked in order to ward off the blow of the sword\. At this Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) turned his face away and spared him his life\. The famous Arab poet al\-

Farazdaq said about it: “There is no good in warding off trouble by ignominy as was done one day by Amr ibn al\-As by exposing his private parts\.” Even in this ignoble act \`Amr ibn al\-As had not the credit of doing it himself, but had rather followed another who had preceded him because the man who first adopted this device was Talhah ibn Abu Talhah who had saved his life in the battle of Uhud by becoming naked before Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and so he showed this

way to the others\. Thus, besides Amr ibn al\-As trick was played by Bisr ibn Abu Arta’ah also to save himself from the sword of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\.

When after the performance of this notable deed Bisr went to Mu\`awiyah the latter recalled Amr ibn al\-As act as precedent in order to remove this man’s shamefulness and said, “O Bisr, no matter\. There is nothing to feel shameful about it in view of \`Amr ibn al\-As’s precedent before you\.”

**Part of the Same Sermon:**

O servants of Allah\! Take lesson from useful items of instruction and shining indications\. Be cautioned by effective items of warning\. Get benefit from preaching and admonition\. It is as though the claws of death are pressed in you, the connection of hope and desires has been cut asunder, hard affairs have befallen you and your march is towards the place where everyone has to go, namely death\. Hence, with every person there is a driver and a witness \(Holy Quran, 50: 21\)\. The driver drives him towards resurrection while the witness furnishes testimony about his deeds\.

**Part of the same sermon \(about Paradise\):**

In Paradise, there are high classes and different abodes\. Its boundary never ends\. He who stays in it will never depart from it\. He who is endowed with everlasting abode in it will not get old and its resident will not face want\.
