**Sermon 23**

**About Keeping Aloof from Envy and Good Behavior Towards Kith and Kin**

Verily the Divine orders descend form heaven to earth like drops of rain bringing to everyone what is destined for him whether plenty or paucity\. So if any one of you observes for his brother plenty of progeny or of wealth or of self, it should not be a worry for him\. So long as a Muslim does not commit such an act that if it is disclosed, he has to bend his eyes \(in shame\) and by which low people are emboldened he is like the gambler who expects that the first draw of his arrow would secure him gain and also cover up the previous loss\.

Similarly, the Muslim who is free from dishonesty expects one of the two good things; either a cal from Allah and in that case whatever is with Allah is the best for him or the livelihood of Allah\. He has already children and property while his faith and respect are with him\. Certainly, wealth and children are the plantations of this world while virtuous deeds are the plantation of the next world\. Sometimes, Allah joins all these in some groups\.

Beware of Allah against what He has cautioned you and keep afraid of Him to the extend that no excuse be needed for it\. Act without show or intention of being heard for if a man acts for some one else then Allah makes him over to that one\. We ask Allah to grant us\) the positions of the martyrs, company of the virtuous and friendship of the prophets\.

O people\! Surely no one \(even though he may be rich\) can do without his kinsmen and their support by hands or tongues\. They alone are his support from the rear and can ward off from him his troubles and they are the most kind to him when tribulations befall him\. The good

<a id="page393"></a>memory of a man that Allah retains among people is better than the property which others inherit from him\.

**In the same sermon, he says the following:**

Behold\! If any one of you finds your near ones in want or starvation, he should not desist from helping them with that which will not increase if this help is not extended nor decrease by thus spending it\. Whoever holds up his hand from \(helping\) his kinsmen, he holds only one hand, but at the same time of his need, many hands remain held up form helping him\. One who is sweet\-tempered can retain the love of his people for good\.

As\-Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “In this sermon, al\-ghafira means plenty or abundance and this is derived from the Arab saying, al\-jam\` al\-ghafir meaning thick crowd\. In some versions for al\-ghafira, the word afwatan appears\. Afwa means the good and selected part of anything\. It is said: akaltu afwata’t\-ta\`am, to mean ‘I ate a choice meal\.’” About Awa man yaqbid yadahu an’ashiratihi appearing towards the end, he points out how beautiful the meaning of this sentence is, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) implies that he who does not help his own kinsmen

withholds only his hand but when he is in need of their assistance and would be looking for their sympathy and support, then he would remain deprived of the sympathies and succor of so many of their extending hands and marching feet\.
