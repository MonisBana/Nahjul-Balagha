**Abdullah ibn Abbas says that when Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) set**

**out to fight the people of Basra, he came to his audience at Thi\-Qar and saw that Abdullah \[ibn Abbas\] was stitching his shoe\. Then Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) said to me, “What is the price of this shoe?” I said:**

**“It has no value now\.” He then said, “By Allah\! It should have been more dear to me than ruling over you except for the fact that I have established right and warded off wrong\.” Then the Imam \(x\) came out and spoke thus:**

<a id="page411"></a>Verily, Allah sent Muhammad \(h\) when none among the Arabs

read a book or claimed Prophethood\. He guided the people till he took them to their \(correct\) status and their salvation and their spears \(ie\. officers\) became straight and their conditions settled down\.

By Allah, surely I was in their lead till it took shape with its walls\. I did not show weakness or cowardice\. My existing march is also like that\. I shall certainly pierce the wrong till right comes out of its side\.

What \(cause of conflict\) is there between the tribesmen of Quraish and me? By Allah, I have fought them when they were unbelievers and I shall fight them when they have been misled\. I shall be the same for them today as I was for them yesterday\.

By Allah, the tribesmen of Quraish only take revenge against us because Allah has given us \(i\.e\. The Holy Prophet \(h\) and his progeny\)

preference over them\. So, we have allowed them into our domain, whereupon they have become as the former poet says the following:

By my life, you continued drinking fresh milk every morning, And \(continued\) eating fine stoned dates with butter;

We have given you the nobility which you did not possess before; And surrounded \(protected\) you with thoroughbred horses and tawny colored spears \(strong spears\)\.

The fact is that the poet’s aim here is to say that the condition of the addressee’s life, from the moral and material point of view, had been worse in the past and that the poet and his tribe had given him the best means of leading their lives\. But as the result of this improved condition the addressee has completely lost himself and forgotten his past condition and thinks that he had led this kind of life before\.

Now, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) wants to convey the same idea here to the tribesmen of Quraish as Fatima \(x\) the holy daughter of the Holy Prophet \(h\) said in her speech on Fadak:

\(O People\!\) You were on the brink of the pit of Hill Fire \(Holy Quran, 3: 103\)\. You were as worthless as themouthful of water\. You were of a minority like the handful of greedy and a spark of the hasty\. You were as down\-trodden as the dust under your feet\. You drank dirty water\.

<a id="page412"></a>You ate untanned skin\. You were abased and condemned\. But Allah has rescued you through my father Muhammad \(h\)\.
