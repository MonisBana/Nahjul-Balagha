**Importance of Fearing Allah, Desolateness of the Grave, Death of Those Who Love Ahl Al\-bayt \(x\) Similar to That of Martyrs**

I praise Him out of gratitude for His rewards and I seek His assistance in fulfilling my obligations to Him\. He has a strong host\. His dignity is grand\. I testify that Muhammad \(k\) is His slave and Prophet\.

He called \(people\) to His obedience and overpowered His enemies when fighting for His religion\. People’s joining together to falsify Him and their attempt to extinguish His light were of no avail\.

You should, therefore, be steadfast in your fear of Allah because it has a rope the knot of which is strong, its pinnacle is lofty and invulnerable\. Hasten towards death in its pangs \(by doing good deeds\) and be prepared for it before its approach because the ultimate end is the Day of Judgement\. This is enough admonishment for one who understands and suffices for a lesson for one who does not know\. What idea do you have, before reaching that end, about how narrow the grave is, about the hardship of loneliness, fear of the passage towards the next world, the pangs of fear, the shifting of ribs here and there \(due to narrowing of the grave\), the deafness of ears, the darkness of the grave, the fear of the promised punishment, the closing of the receptacle of the grave and the laying of the tomb stones?

So fear Allah, fear Allah, O servants of Allah, because the world is behaving with you in the usual way, and you and the Day of Judgement are in the same rope \(close to each other\), as though it has come with its signs, has approached with its pleas and has made you stand in its way\. It is as though it has come forward with all its quaking and has settled down with its chest on the ground while the world has parted from its people and turned them out of its lap\. It was like a day that has passed or a month that has gone by\. Its new things have become old and the fat ones have become thin\.

They are in a narrow place, in very complicated affairs and in a fire whose pain is intense, the cries are loud, the flames rise \[as high as mountains\], the sound causes a trembling, the burning is severe and abatement from all of this is quite remote\. Its fuel is burning, its threats are fearful, its hollows are hidden, its sides are dark, its vessels are aflame and everything about it is abominable\.

<a id="page646"></a>“Those who feared \(the wrath of\) their Master shall be conveyed in groups to the Garden” \(Holy Quran, 39: 73\)\. They are safe from chastisement, away from punishment and are kept aloof from the fire\. Their abode will be peaceful, and they will be pleased with their lodging and place of stay\. These are the people whose deeds in this world were pure, their eyes were tearful, their nights in this world were like days because of fearing \[Allah\], seeking \[His\] forgiveness, and their days were like nights because of feeling of loneliness and separation\. Therefore, Allah made Paradise the place of their \(eventual\) return, a reward in recompense\. They were most eligible and suitable for it \(Holy Quran, 48: 26\) in the eternal domain and everlasting bliss\.

Therefore, O servants of Allah, pay regard to all that by being mindful of which one will succeed and by ignoring which one will incur loss\. Hasten towards your death by means of your \(good\) deeds because you are bound by what you have done in the past, and you have to your credit only what \(good deeds\) you have sent before\. \(Behave in such a way\) as though the feared event \(death\) has come upon you, so you cannot return \(to do good deeds\) nor can you be cleared of evil deeds\. May Allah prompt us and you to be obedient to Him and to His Prophet \(h\), and may He forgive us and your own selves by His great mercy\.

Remain patient during trials and tribulations\. Do not move your hands and swords after the liking of your tongues, and do not make haste in matters in which Allah has not asked for haste: anyone of you who dies in his bed while having knowledge of the rights of Allah and the rights of His Prophet \(h\) and members of the Prophet’s house will die as a martyr\.

His reward is incumbent on Allah\. He is also eligible to the recompense of what good deeds he has intended to do, since his intention takes the place of drawing his sword\. Certainly, for everything there is a time and a limit\.
