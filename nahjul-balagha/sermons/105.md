**Sermon 105**

**About Islam :**

Praise be to Allah Who established Islam and made it easy for those who approach it and gave strength to its columns against any one who tries to overpower it\. So Allah made it \(a source of\) peace for whoever clings to it, safety for whoever enters it, argument for whoever speaks about it, witness for whoever fights with its help, light for whoever seeks light from it, understanding for whoever provides it, sagacity for whoever exerts, a sign \(of guidance\) for whoever perceives, sight for whoever resolves, lesson for whoever seeks advice, salvation for whoever testifies, confidence for whoever trusts, pleasure for whoever entrusts and a shield for whoever endures\.

It is the brightest of all paths and the clearest of all passages\. It has dignified minarets, bright highways, burning lamps, prestigious fields of activity and high objectives\. It has a collection of race horses\. It is

<a id="page503"></a>approached eagerly\. Its riders are honorable\. A testimony \(to Allah, Prophet \(h\), etc\.\) is its way, good deeds are its minarets, death is in

extremity, this world is its race \-course\. The Day of Judgement is its horses and Paradise is its point of approach\.

**Part of the same sermon About the Holy Prophet \(h\):**

The Prophet \(h\) lit flames for the seeker and put bright signs for

the impeded\. So he is Your trustworthy trustee, Your witness on the Day of Judgement, Your deputy as a blessing and Your messenger of truth as mercy\. May Allah distribute to him a share from Your Justice and award him multiples of good by Your bounty\. May Allah heighten his construction over the construction of others, honor him when he comes to You, dignify his status before You, give him honorable status and award him glory and distinction and bring us out \(on Day of Judgement\) among his party, neither ashamed, nor repentant, nor deviators, nor pledge\-breakers, nor strayers, nor misleading others, nor seduced\.

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “This sermon had already appeared earlier but we have repeated it here because of the difference between the two versions\.

**Part of the same sermon addressing his followers:**

By the bounty of Allah over you, you have acquired a status where even your slave maids are honored, your neighbors are treated well\. Even he over whom you enjoy no distinction or obligation honors you\. Even those people fear you who had no apprehension of attack from you or any authority over you\. You now see pledges of Allah being broken but do not feel enraged although you fret and frown on the breaking of traditions of your forefathers\. Allah’s matters have been coming back to you; but you have given your place to wrongdoers and thrown your responsibilities toward them\. You have placed Allah’s affairs in their hands\. They act in doubts and tread in \(fulfillment of\) desires\. By Allah, even if they disperse you under every star Allah will surely collect you on the day that will be worst for them\.
