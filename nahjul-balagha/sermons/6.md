**Sermon 6**

**Delivered on being advised not to chase Talhah ibn Ubaydillah and az\-Zubayr ibn al\-Awwam for fighting\. 121**

By Allah, I shall not be like the badger, which feigns sleep on the continuous \(sound of\) stone \-throwing till he who is in search of it find it or he who is on the look out for it overpowers it\. Rather, I shall ever strike the deviators from truth with the help of those who advance toward it and the sinner and doubters with the help of those who listen to me and obey, till my day \(of death\) comes\. By Allah, I have been continually deprived of my right from the day the Prophet \(h\) died until today\.
