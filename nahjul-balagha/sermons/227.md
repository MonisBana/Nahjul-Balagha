**Sermon 227**

**Allegiance to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) for the Caliphate\.**

**\(A similar sermon in somewhat different version has already been cited\.\)**

You drew out my hand towards you so you may swear the oath of allegiance to me, but I held it back\. And you stretched it again, but I contracted it\. Then you crowded over me as the thirsty camels crowd on the watering cisterns on their being taken there, so much so that shoes were torn, shoulder\-cloths fell away and the weak got trampled upon\. And the happiness of people on their allegiance to me was so manifest, small children felt joyful, the old staggered \(up to me\) for it, the sick, too, reached for it helter skelter and young girls ran for it even without veils\.
