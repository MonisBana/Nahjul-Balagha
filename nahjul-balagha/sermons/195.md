**Sermon 195**

**The Condition of the World at the Time of the Proclamation of Prophethood, the Transience of this World and the State of its Inhabitants \.**

Allah deputed the Prophet \(h\) when no sign of guidance existed, no beacon was giving light and no passage was clear\.

I admonish you, O servants of Allah, to fear Allah, and I warn you of this world which is a house from which departure is inevitable, and it is a place of discomfort\. Whoever lives in it has to depart, and whoever stays here has to leave\. It is drifting with its people like a boat which severe winds dash \(here and there\) in the deep sea\. Some get drowned and die, while others escape on the surface of the waves; winds push them with their currents and carry them towards their dangers\. So, whatever is drowned cannot be restored and whatever escapes is on the way to destruction\.

O servants of Allah\! You should know now that you have to perform \(good\) deeds because \(presently\) your tongues are free, your bodies are healthy, your limbs have movement, the area of your coming and going is vast and the course for your running is wide, before the loss of opportunity or the approach of death\. Take deathâ€™s approach as imminent and do not think it will come \(hereafter\)\.
