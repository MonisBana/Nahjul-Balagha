**Delivered During One of the Fighting Days of the Battle of**

**SiffÂ‰n:**

<a id="page504"></a>I have seen your flight and your dispersal from the lines\. You were surrounded by rude and low people and bedouins of Syria, although you are the chiefs of Arabs and the summit of distinction and you possess dignity as that of the high nose and the big hump of a camel\. The sigh of my bosom can subside only when I eventually see you surrounding them as they surrounded you and see you dislodging them from their status as they dislodged you, killing them with arrows and striking them with spears so that their forward rows might fall on the rear ones just like the thirsty camels who have been turned away from their place of drink and removed from their water\-points\.
