**Supplication**

O Lord\! You are the most attached to Your lovers and the most ready to assist those who trust in You\. You see them in their concealment, know whatever is in their conscience and are aware of the extent of their intelligence\. Consequently, their secrets are open to You and their hearts are eager from You\. If loneliness bores them, Your remembrance gives them solace\. If distresses befall them, they solicit Your protection because they know that the reins of affairs are in Your hands and that their movements depend upon Your commands\.

O Lord\! If I am unable to express my request or cannot see my needs, then guide me towards my betterment\. Take my betterment and my heart towards the sound goal\. This is not against \(the mode of\) Your guidance nor anything new against Your ways of support\.

O Lord\! Deal with me with Your forgiveness and do not deal with me according to Your justice\.
