**Sermon 51**

**During the Battle of Siffin, the men who were fighting on the side of Mu\`awiyah overpowered the men of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\), occupying the bank of the River Euphrates and preventing them from having access to its water\. It is then that Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) said the following:**

They are asking you for morsels of battle\. So, either you remain in ignominy and the lowest status or drench your swords with blood and quench your thirst with water\. Real death is living in subjugation, while real life is in dying as subjugators\. Beware, Mu\`awiyah is leading a small group of insurgents and has kept them in the dark about the true facts with the result that they have made their bosoms the targets of death\.

Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) had not reached Siffin when Mu\`awiyah

posted forty thousand of his fighting men on the bank of the river to close the way to the watering place, so that none except the Syrians could take the water\. When Amir al\- Mu’minin’s force alighted the re, they found that there was no watering place except for one possibility\. If it existed, it was difficult to reach due to crossing high hillocks\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)

sent Sa\`sa\`ah ibn Suhan al\-Abdi to Mu\`awiyah with the request to release control over the water\. Mu\`awiyah refused\. On this side Amir al\-Mu’minin’s army was troubled by thirst\. When Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)

noticed this status he said, “Get up and secure water by dint of the sword\.” Consequently, these thirsty persons drew their swords out of sheaths, put arrows in their bows and dispersing Mu\`awiyah’s men, went down toward the river, forcing his guards away\. They then took control of the watering place themselves\.

Now, Amir al\-Mu’minin’s men also desired that just as Mu\`awiyah had put restrictions on the water by occupation, the same treatment should be accorded to him and his men and no Syrian should be allowed water and everyone of them should be made to die of thirst\. But Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) said, “Do you want to take the same brutal step

which these Syrians had taken? Never prevent anyone from water\. Whoever wants to drink, may drink and whoever wants to take away may

<a id="page430"></a>take away\.” Consequently, despite occupation of the River by Amir al\-Mu’minin’s army, no one was prevented from the water and everyone was given full liberty to use it\.
