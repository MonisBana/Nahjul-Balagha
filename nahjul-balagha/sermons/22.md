**About Those Who Accused Him of \`Othman’s Killing**

Beware\! Satan has certainly started instigating his forces and has collected his army in order that oppression may reach its extreme ends and wrong may come back to its status\. By Allah, they have not put a correct blame on me, nor have they done justice between me and themselves\.

They are demanding of me a right which they have abandoned and a blood that they have themselves shed\. If I were a partner with them in it then they too have their share of it\. But if they did it without me they alone have to face the consequences\. Their biggest argument \(against me\) is really against their own selves\. They are suckling from a mother who is already dry and bringing into life innovation that is already dead\. How disappointing is this challenger 9to battle\) ? Who is this challenger and for what is he being responded to? I am happy that the reasoning of Allah has been exhausted before them and He knows \(all\) about them\. If they refuse \(to obey\) I will offer them the edge of the sword which is enough of a cure of wrong and supporter of right\.

It is strange that they send me word to proceed to them for spear\-fighting and to keep ready for fighting with swords\. May the mourning women mourn over them\. I have ever been so that I as never frightened

<a id="page391"></a>by fighting nor threatened by clashing\. I enjoy full certainty of belief from my Allah and have no doubt in my faith\.

When Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) was accused of \`Othman’s

assassination, he delivered this sermon to refute that allegation, wherein he says about those who blamed him that: “These seekers of vengeance cannot say that I alone am the assassin and that no one else took part in it\. Nor can they falsify witnessed events by saying that they were unconcerned with it\. Why then have they put me foremost for this avenging? With me they should include themselves also\. If I am free of this blame they cannot establish their freedom from it\. How can they detach themselves from this punishment? the truth of the matter is that by accusing me of this charge, their aim is that I should behave with them in the same manner to which they are accustomed\. But they should behave with them in the same manner to which they are accustomed\. But they should not expect from me that I would revive the innovations of the previous regimes\. As for fighting, neither was I ever afraid of it nor am I so now\. Allah knows my intention and He also knows that those standing on the excuse of taking revenge are themselves his assassins\. Thus, history corroborates that the people who managed his \(Othman’s\) assassination by agitation and had even prevented his burial in Muslims’ graveyard by hurling stones at his coffin were the same who rose for avenging his blood\. In this connection, the names of Talhah ibn Ubaydillah, az\-Zubayr ibn al\-Awwam and Aisha are at the top of the list since on both occasions their efforts come to sigh with conspicuity\. Thus ibn Abul\-Hadid writes that: “Those who have written the account f the assassination of Othman state that one ht day of his killing Talhah’s condition was that in order to obscure himself form the eyes of the people he had a veil on his face and was shooting arrows at Othman’s house\.”

And, in this connection about az\-Zubayr ideas he writes the following: “Historians have also stated that az\-Zubayr used to say: “Kill Othman\. He has altered your faith\.’129 People said, “Your son is standing at his door and guarding him and he replied, “Even my son my be lost, but Othman must be killed\. Othman will be lying like a carcass on the Sirat tomorrow” \(Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 9, pp\. 35\-36\)\.

129Az\-Zubayr here was echoing what his cousin, Aisha, used to say, that is, _Uqtulu Na\`thal faqad kafar _\(Kill Na\`thal \[a bad name whereby she called Othman\],\* \*for he has committed apostasy\)\. \_\_ Ed\.

<a id="page392"></a>About Aisha, Ibn Abd Rabbih writes the following: “Mughirah ibn Shu’bah came to Aisha when she said, “O Abu Abdullah, I wish you have been with me on the day of Jamal; how arrows were piercing through my hawdaj \(camel litter\) till some of them stuck my body\.’ Al\-Mughirah said, “I wish one of them should have killed you\.’ She said, “Allah may have pity on you; why so?’ He replied, “So that it would have been some atonement for what you had done against Othman’, according to Al\-Iqd al\-Farid, Vol\. 4, p\. 294\.
