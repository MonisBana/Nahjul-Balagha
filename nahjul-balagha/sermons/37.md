**Sermon 37**

**Amir Al\-Mu’minin’s Utterance Which Runs like a Sermon about His Own Steadfastness in Religion and Precedence in \(Acceptance of\) Conviction\.**

I discharged duties when others lost courage \(to do so\) and I came forward when others hid themselves\. I spoke when others remained mum\. I struck with the Divine light when others remained standing\. I was the quietest of them in voice but the highest in going forward\. I cleaved to its rein and applied myself solely to its pledge, like the mountain which neither sweeping wind could move nor storm could shake\. No one could find fault with me nor could any speaker speak ill of me\.

The low is in my view worthy of honor till I secure \(his\) right for him while the strong is in my view weak till I take their \(assumed\) right from them\. We are happy with the destiny ordained by Allah and have submitted to the command of Allah\. Do you think I would speak lies about the Prophet of Allah \(k\)? By Allah, I am surely the first to testify

of him, so I will not be the first to falsify him\. I looked at my affairs and found that my obedience should have precedence over my allegiance while my pledge to him is a burden on my neck\.
