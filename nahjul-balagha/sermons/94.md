**About the Condition of the People at the Time of the Prophet’s Proclamation and about His Actions Having to Do with the Dissemination of His Message:**

<a id="page491"></a>Allah sent the Prophet \(h\) at a time when the people were going

astray in perplexity and were moving here and there in mischief\. Desires had deflected them and self\-conceit had swerved them\. Extreme ignorance had made them foolish\. They were confounded by the unsteadiness of matters and the evils of ignorance\. Then the Prophet \(h\)

did his best in giving them sincere advice, himself trod on the right path and called \(them\) towards wisdom and good counsel\.
