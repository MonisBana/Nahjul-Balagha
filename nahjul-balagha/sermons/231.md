**On the Inability of Ja’dah Ibn Hubayrah Al\-Makhzumi1 to**

**Deliver a Sermon\. About Speaking the Truth **:

Be informed that the tongue is part of a man’s body\. If the man desists, speech will not cooperate with him, and when he dilates, speech will not give him time to stop\. Certainly, we are the masters of speech\. Its veins are fixed in us and its branches are hanging over us\.

Be informed, may Allah have mercy on you, that you are living at a time when those who speak about right are few, when tongues are loath to utter the truth and those who stick to what is right are humiliated\. The people of this time are engaged in disobedience\. Their youths are wicked, their old men are sinful, their learned men are hypocrites and their speakers are psychopathics\. Their youths do not respect their elders and their rich do not support the destitute\.

199Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) asked his nephew \(sister’s son\), Ja’dah

ibn Hubayrah al\-Makhzumi, once to deliver a sermon\. But when the man stood up to speak, his tongue faltered and he could utter nothing, whereupon Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) ascended the pulpit to speak and delivered a long sermon out of which a few sentences have been recorded here by Sayyid ar\-Radi\.
