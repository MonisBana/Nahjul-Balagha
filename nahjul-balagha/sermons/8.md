**About Az\-Zubayr at a Time For Which it Was Appropriate**

He asserts that he swore allegiance to me with his hand, but did not swear with his heart\.123

So he does admit allegiance\. In regards to his claiming it with his heart he should come forward with a clear argument for it\. otherwise, he should return to wherefrom he has gone out\.124

them the re, while these young ones jump and play in their laps without demur\. He means that Satanic evil ideas take birth in their bosoms and grow and thrive the re\. There is no restrain on them, nor restriction of any kind\. He has permeated their blood and mingled their spirit so that both have become completely unified\. Now, the eyes are theirs but the sight is his, the tongue is theirs but he words are his and the Prophet \(h\) has said, “Verily, Stan permeates the progeny of Adam like blood\.

That is, just as the circulation of blood does not stop, the same way, the quick succession of Satan’s evil ideas knows no break and he draws man toward evil in sleep in wakefulness and in every posture, rising or sitting\. He so paints them with his dye that their word and action reflect an exact portrait of his word and action\. Those whose bosoms shine with the glory of faith prevent such evil ideas but some are already ready to welcome those evils and these are the persons who, under the garb of Islam, are after the advancement of heresy\.

123After swearing allegiance on the hand of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\), az\-

Zubayr ibn al\-Awwam broke the allegiance\. Then sometimes he put forth the excuse that he was forced to swear allegiance and that forced allegiance is no allegiance and sometimes, he said that allegiance was only for show\. His heart did not go in accord to it\. As though he himself admitted with his tongue the duplicity of his outer appearance and inner self\. But this excuse is like that of the one who reverts to apostasy after adopting Islam and to avoid penalty may say that he had accepted Islam only by the tongue, not in the heart\. Obviously, such an excuse cannot be heard nor can avoid punishment\. If az\-Zubayr suspected that Othman was slain at insistence of Amir al\-Mu’minin, this suspicion should have existed when he was taking the oath for obedience and stretching his hand for allegiance, not now that his expectations were getting frustrated and hopes had started dawning from somewhere else\.
