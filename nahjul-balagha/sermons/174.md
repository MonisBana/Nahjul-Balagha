**Warning Neglectful People; the Vastness of His Knowledge**

O people who are \(negligent of Allah but\) not neglected \(by Allah\) and those who miss \(doing good deeds\) but are to be caught\! How is it that I see you becoming distanced from Allah and becoming interested in others? You are like the camel whom the shepherd drives to a disease\-stricken pasture and a disastrous watering place\. They are like animals who are fed in order to be slaughtered, but they do not know what is intended for them\. When they are treated well, they consider that day to be their whole life and eating to their fill as their aim\.

By Allah, if I wish, I can tell everyone of you from where he has come, where he has to go and all his affairs\. But I fear lest you \(in such case\) should abandon the Messenger of Allah \(k\) in my favor\. I shall certainly convey these things to the selected ones who will remain safe from such a dreadful thing\. By Allah Who deputed the Prophet \(h\) with

178The Imam here means to say that if Talhah considered Othman an oppressor, then after his assassination, instead of getting ready to avenge his blood, he should have supported his killers and justified their action\. It is not the intention that in the case of \`Othman being wrong that Talhah should have supported the attackers because he was already supporting and encouraging them\.

<a id="page607"></a>the truth and distinguished him over all creation, I do not speak save the truth\. He \(the Prophet \(h\)\) informed me of all this and also of the death

of everyone who dies, the salvation of everyone who is granted salvation and the consequences of this matter \(the caliphate\)\. He left nothing \(that could\) pass into my head without putting it in my ear and telling me about it\.

O people\! By Allah, I do not impel you to any obedience unless I practice it before you, nor do I restrain you from any disobedience unless I desist from it before you\.

Those who drink from the springs of revelation and the Divine inspiration are able to see things that are hidden behind the curtains, things of the unknown, and the events which will occur in the future\. They do so in the same way as objects are seen with the eyes\. This does not contradict with the following statement of Allah: “Say: ‘None \(either\) in the heavens or in the earth knows the unseen save Allah’” \(Holy Quran,

1. 65\) because this verse contains the negation of personal knowledge of the unknown, but not the negation of knowledge which is required by the prophets and holy persons through the Divine inspiration by virtue of which they make prophecies about the future and unveil many events and happenings\. Several verses of the Holy Quran support this view such as:\.

“When the Prophet \(h\) confided a matter to one of his wives, she

divulged it \(to others\) and Allah informed him of it\. He revealed a part of it and avoided a part\. So, when he informed her of it, said she: ‘Who informed you of this?’ He said, “The All\-knowing, the All\-aware informed me’” \(Holy Quran, 66: 3\)\.

“These are of the tidings of the unseen which We reveal to you \(O Our Prophet Muhammad\)\.\.\.”\(Holy Quran, 11: 49\)\.

It is, therefore, wrong to argue in support for the view that if it is said that the prophets and holy persons possess knowledge of the unknown, this will imply duality with regard to the Divine attributes\. It will have implied duality if it were said that someone other than Allah has personal knowledge of the unknown\. When it is not so, and the knowledge of the Prophets and Imams is given by Allah, it has no connection with duality\. If duality should mean what is alleged, what will be the status of Isa’s \(Jesus’s\) assertion related thus in the Holy Qurany:

<a id="page608"></a>“\.\.\. \.Out of clay will I make for you like the figure of a bird, and I will breathe into it and it shall become a flying bird by Allah’s permission, and I shall heal the blind and the leper and will cause the dead to rise to life by Allah’s permission, and I will declare to you what you eat and what you store in you houses” \(Holy Quran, 3: 49\)\.

If it is believed that Aisha \(Jesus\) could create and bestow life with Allah’s permission, does this mean that he was Allah’s partner in the attributes of creation and revival? If this is not so, then how can it be said that if Allah gives someone the knowledge of the unknown, it implies that he has been taken him to be His partner in His attributes? And how can anyone extol one’s belief in the Oneness of Allah by holding that the knowledge of the unknown implies duality?

No one can deny the fact that some people either see in dreams certain things which have yet to occur in the future, or that things can be read through interpretation of the dream, while during a dream neither do the senses function nor do the powers of understanding and comprehension operate\. Therefore, if some events become known to some people while being awake, why should there be amazement over it, and what are the grounds for rejecting it when it stands to reason that things possible in dreams are also possible in wakefulness? Thus, Ibn Maytham al\-Bahrani has written that it is possible to achieve all this because in a dream the spirit becomes free from looking after the body and is removed from bodily connections\. As a result of this, it perceives such hidden realities which could not be seen because of the obstruction of the body\. In the same way, those perfect beings who pay no heed to bodily matters and turn with all the attention of spirit and heart towards the center of knowledge can see those realities and secrets which the ordinary eyes are unable to discern\. Therefore, keeping in view the spiritual greatness of Ahl al\-Bayt \(x\), it should not appear strange that they were aware of

events which were going to occur in the future\. Ibn Khaldun has written the following:\.

“When thaumaturgic feats are performed by others, what do you think about those who were distinguished for their knowledge and honesty and were a mirror of the Prophet’s traits, confiding what Allah had for them on account of their noble lineage, is a proof of the high performances of his chaste offspring \(Ahl al\-Bayt \[x\]\)\. Consequently,

many events about knowledge of the unknown are related about Ahl al\-Bayt \(x\), events which are not related about others” \(Al\-Muqaddima, p\. 23\)\.

<a id="page609"></a>Thus, there is no cause for wonder over Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s claim since he was brought up by the Prophet \(h\) and was a

student in Allah’s school\. Of course, those whose knowledge does not extend beyond the limits of physical goals and whose means of learning are confined to the bodily senses refuse to believe in the knowledge about the paths of the Divine cognizance and reality\. If this kind of claim was unique and was heard only from Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), then minds

could have wavered and temperaments could have hesitated to accept it\.

But if the Holy Quran records even such a claim of Aisha \(Jesus\) that “\.\.\. I can tell you what you eat or drink or store in your houses\.\.\.” then why should there be any hesitation about Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s claim when it is agreed upon that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had succeeded in

attaining distinctions of the Prophet \(h\), and it cannot be disputed that the Prophet \(h\) did not know what Aisha \(Jesus\) knew\. Thus, if the successor of the Prophet \(h\) advances such a claim, why should it be rejected, particularly since this vastness of knowledge of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) is the best testimony and proof of the Prophet’s knowledge and perfection, a living miracle testifying to his truthfulness\.

In this regard, it is amazing that even having knowledge of events which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) did not, through any of his words or

deeds, indicate that he knew them\. Thus, commenting about the extraordinary importance of this claim, Sayyid Ibn Tawus writes the following:\.

“An amazing aspect of this claim is that despite the fact that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) was aware of conditions and events, he

observed such conduct by way of his words and deeds that one who saw him could not believe that he knew the secrets and unknown acts of others because the wise agree that if a person knows what event is likely to take place or what step his comrade is going to take, or if the hidden secrets of people are known to him, then the effects of such knowledge will appear through his movements and the expressions of his face\. But the man who, in spite of knowing everything, behaves in a way as though he is unaware and knows nothing, personality is a miracle and a combination of contradictions\.

At this stage, the question arises as to why Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) did not act upon the dictates of his secret knowledge\. The reply

<a id="page610"></a>to this is that the commands of the Shar\`a are based on apparent conditions; otherwise, secret knowledge is a kind of miracle and power which Allah grants to His prophets and Imams\. Although the prophets and Imams possess this power always, they cannot make use of it at any time unless and until there is permission of Allah and on the proper occasion\. For example, the verse quoted above about Aisha \(Jesus\) which tells that he had the power to give life, to heal the blind and declare what one ate and stored in his house, etc\. he \(Jesus\) was not used to practice this power on everything or every corpse or everyone who met him\. He used to practice this power only by the permission of Allah and on the proper occasion\.

If prophets and other holy men acted on the basis of their secret knowledge, it would have meant serious dislocation and disturbance in the affairs of the people\. For example, if a prophet, or the Almighty, on the basis of his secret knowledge, punishes a condemnable man by killing him, there will be a great commotion and agitation among those who see it on the ground that he killed an “innocent” man\. This is why Allah has not permitted the basing of conclusions on secret knowledge except in a few special cases, enjoining the following of observable factors\. Thus, despite his being aware of the hypocrisy of some of the hypocrites, the Prophet \(h\) extended to them the amicable treatment that be extended to

other Muslims\.

Now, there can be no room for the objection that if Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) knew secret matters, then why did he not act accordingly?

The answer is: It has been demonstrated that he was not obliged to act according to the requirements of his secret knowledge\. Of course, where conditions so required, he did, indeed, disclose some matters for the purposes of preaching, admonishing, giving good tidings \(of rewards\) or warning \(against punishments\), so that future events could be avoided\. For example, Imam Ja\`far as\-Sadiq \(x\) informed Yahya ibn Zayd that if

he marched out \[against the Umayyads\], he would be killed\. Ibn Khaldun writes the following in this regard:\.

“It has been authentically related from Imam Ja\`far as\-Sadiq that he used to forewarn some of his close relatives of the fateful events to fall upon them\. For example, he forewarned his cousin Yahya ibn Zayd of being killed, but the latter disobeyed him; he marched out and was martyred in Juzjan” \(Al\-Muqaddama, p\. 233\)\.

<a id="page611"></a>Nevertheless, where there was apprehension that minds would worry, such was not disclosed at all\. That is why in this sermon Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) avoided more details in view of his apprehension that

people would begin to regard him as being higher than the Prophet \(h\)\. Despite all of this, people did, in fact, go astray about Isa \(Jesus\)\. Likewise with regard to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), some people also

started saying all sorts of things and were thus misled into resorting to exaggeration\.
