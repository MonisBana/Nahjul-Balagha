**About the Angel of Death and the Soul Taking Leave :**

Do you feel when the Angel of Death enters a house, or do you see him when he calls the life out from someone? How does he take out the life of an embryo in the womb of his mother? Does he reach it through any part of her body or does the spirit respond to his call with the permission of Allah? Or does he stay with him in the motherâ€™s inside? How can he who is unable to describe a creature like this, describe Allah?
