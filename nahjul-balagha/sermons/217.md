**When Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Passed by the Corpses of**

**Talhah Ibn Ubaydullah and \`Abd Ar\-rahman Ibn Attab Ibn Asid, Who Were Both Killed in the Battle of Jamal, He Said the Following:**\.

<a id="page708"></a>Abu Muhammad \(Talhah\) lies here away from his own place\. By Allah, I did not like that the tribesmen of Quraish should lie killed under the stars\. I have avenged myself, together with the descendants of \`Abd Manaf, but the chief persons of Banu Jumah195 have slipped away from my grip\. They had stretched their necks towards a matter for which they were not suited and, therefore, their necks were broken before they reached their goal\.
