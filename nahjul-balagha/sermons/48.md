**Delivered at the Time of Marching Towards Syria\.**

Praise is due to Allah when night spreads and darkens and praise be to Allah whenever the star shines and sets\. And praise be to Allah Whose bounty never misses and whose favors cannot be repaid\.

135During pre\-Islamic days, a market used to be organized every year near Mecca\. Its name was \`Ukaz where mostly hides were traded and as a result, leather was attributed to it\. Besides the sales and purchases, literary meetings were also arranged and Arabs used to attract admiration by reciting their works\. After Islam because of the better congregation in the form of Hajj, this market diminished\.

136This prediction of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) was fulfilled word for word

and the world saw how the people who had committed tyranny and oppression on the strength of their masterly power had to face the tragic end\. The ways of their own destruction were engendered by their blood \-shedding and homicidal activities\. Consequently, the end of Ziyad ibn Abih \(son of an unknown father\) was that when he intended to deliver a speech for vilification of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) suddenly

paralysis overtook him and he could not get out of his bed\. The end of the bloodshed perpetrated by Ubaydullah ibn Ziyad was when he fell prey to leprosy and eventually blood thirsty swords put him to death\. The ferocity of al\-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf ath\-Thaqafi drove him to the fate that snakes cropped up in his stomach as a result of which he died after severe pain\. \`Umar ibn Hubayrah al\-Fizari died of leucoderma\. Khalid ibn Abdillah al\-Qasri suffered the hardships of prison and was killed in a very bad way\. Mis’ab ibn az\-Zubayr and Yazid ibn al\-Muhallab ibn Abu Sufrah were also killed by swords\.

<a id="page428"></a>Well, I have sent forward my vanguard137 and have ordered them to remain in the camp on this bank of the river till my order reaches them\. My intention is that I should cross this water over to the small habitation of people residing on the sides of the Tigris and rouse them to march with you towards the enemy and keep them as an auxiliary force for you\.
