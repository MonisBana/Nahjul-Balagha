**Sermon 103**

**About the Condition of the People Before the Proclamation of Prophethood and the Prophet’s Performance in Spreading His Message :**

So now, certainly Allah deputed Muhammad \(h\) as the Prophet \(h\) while no one among the Arabs read the Book nor claimed

Prophethood or revelation\. He had to fight those who disobeyed him in the company with those who followed him, leading them towards their salvation and hastening with them lest death overtake them\. When any weary person sighed or a distressed one stopped, he stood with him till he got him his desire, except the worst in whom there was no virtue at all\. Eventually he showed them their goal and carried them to their places \(of deliverance\)\. Consequently their affairs moved on and their hand\-mill began to rotate \(i\.e\. a status gained strength\), their spears got straightened\.

By Allah, I was among their rear\-guard till they turned back on their sides and were flocked in their rope\. I never showed weakness or

<a id="page501"></a>lack of courage, nor did I betray or become languid\. By Allah,I shall split the wrong till I extract right from its flanks\.

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: I have quoted a selected part of this sermon before, but since I have found in the narration that this part differs from the previous one, more or less, I deemed it necessary to quote it again here\.
