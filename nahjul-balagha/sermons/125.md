**Sermon 125**

**When Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Was Spoken Ill of for**

**Showing Equality in the Distribution \(Of Shares from Bayt al\-Mal or the Muslim Public Treasury\) He Said the Following :**

Do you command me that I should seek support by oppressing those over whom I have been placed? By Allah, I will not do so as long as the world goes on and as long as one star leads another in the sky\. Even if it were my property, I will have distributed it equally among them, then why not when the property is that of Allah\. Beware; certainly that giving of wealth without any right for it is wastefulness and lavishness\. It raises its doer in this world, but lowers him in the next world\. It honors him before people, but disgraces him with Allah\. If a man gives his property to those who have no right for it or do not deserve it, Allah deprives him of their gratefulness and their love too will be for others\. Then if he falls on bad days and needs their help, they will prove the worst comrades and ignoble friends\.
