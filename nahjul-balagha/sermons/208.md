**Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Went to Inquire about the Health**

**of His Companion Al\-Ala’ Ibn Ziyad al\-Harithi\. When He Noticed the Vastness of His Mansion Estate, He Said the Following :**

What will you do with this vast house in this world, although you need this house more in the next world? If you want to take it to the next world, you can entertain in it guests and be regardful of kinship and discharge all \(your\) obligations according to their accrual\. In this way, you will be able to take it to the next world\.

Then al\-Ala said to him: “O Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\! I want to complain to you about my brother Asim ibn Ziyad\.” Imam Ali ibn Abu

agree to arbitration\. Among these people there were some who had actually been duped, believing that they were being asked to abide by the Holy Quran, but there were others who had become weary of the long duration of the war and had lost stomach for it, thus cowering\. Then people got a good opportunity to stop the war; so, they cried hoarse for its postponements\. There were others who had accompanied Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) because of his temporal authority

but did not support him by heart, nor did they aim at achieving victory for him\. There were some people who had expectations with Mu\`awiyah and had started attaching hopes to him for worldly gains, while there were some who were, from the very beginning, \[covertly\] in league with him\. In these circumstances, and with such an army, it was really due to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s political ability and competence of military control and administration that he carried out the war up to this stage\. Had Mu\`awiyah not adopted this trick, there could have been no doubt in Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s victory because the military power of the Syrian forces had been exhausted and defeat was hovering over their heads\. In this regard, Ibn Abul\-Hadd writes the following: “Malik al\-Ashtar had reached Mu\`awiyah and \[angrily\] grabbed him by the neck\. The entire might of the Syrians had been smashed\. Only so much movement was discernable in them as remains in the tail of a lizard which is killed, but the tail continues hopping right and left” \(_Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha_, Vol\. 11, pp\.30\-1\)\.

<a id="page688"></a>Talib \(x\) inquired: “What is the matter with him?” Al\-Ala’ said the

following: “He has put on a woolen coat and cut off himself from the world\.” Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said, “Let me see him\.” When the man came, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said to him, “O enemy of

yourself\! Certainly, the evil one \(Satan\) has misguided you\. Do you feel no compassion for your wife and children? Do you believe that if you use those things which Allah has made lawful for you, He will dislike you? You are too unimportant for Allah to do so\.” The man said, “O Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\! You yourself put on coarse outfits and eat rough food\.”

The Imam replied thus: “Woe unto you\! I am not like you\. Certainly, Allah, the Sublime, has made it obligatory on true leaders that they should maintain themselves at the level of low people so that the poor do not cry over their poverty\.”

Since ancient times, asceticism and the abandonment of worldly attachments has been regarded as a means of purification of the spirit and importance of the soul\. Consequently, those who wished to lead a life of abstention and meditation used to go out of the cities and towns to stay in forests and caves in the mountains and stay there concentrating on Allah according to their own way of thinking\. They would eat only if a casual traveler or the inhabitant of nearby dwellings gave them anything to eat; otherwise, they remained contented with the fruits of wild trees and the water of the streams\. Thus did they pass their life away from the public\. Actually, this way of “worship” commenced in a way that was forced by the oppression and cruelty of rulers\. Certain people left their houses and, in order to avoid the grip of such rulers, hid in some wilderness or a cave in a mountain, engaging themselves in worship of and devotion to Allah\. Later on, this forced asceticism acquired a voluntary form and people began to retire to caves and hollows of their own volition\. Thus, it became an accepted way that whoever aimed at spiritual development retired to some corner after severing himself from all worldly ties\. This method remained in vogue for centuries\. Even nowadays, some traces of this way of “worship” are found among Buddhists and Christians\.

The moderate views of Islam do not, however, agree with the monastic life style\. In order to attain spiritual development, one does not have to abandon lawful worldly enjoyments and pleasures, nor should a Muslim leave his house and fellow men and keep himself occupied in such sort of “worship\.” One must not thus hide in some corner\. The concept of worship in Islam is not confined to a few particular rituals\. Islam regards the earning of one’s livelihood through lawful means, sympathy with and concern about others, good behavior, and cooperation

<a id="page689"></a>with and assistance of others are absolutely important, so important that they are the stuff of true worship\. If an individual ignores his responsibilities and does not fulfil his obligations towards his wife and children, nor does he occupy himself with earning a livelihood but instead spends all his time meditating, he ruins his life and does not fulfil the purpose of living in this world\. If this were Allah’s aim behind creating His servants, what would have been the need for creating and populating the world especially when there was already a category of beings who all the time are engaged in worshipping and adoring the Lord of Lords, seeking forgiveness for His servants?

The Creator has made man stand at the cross\-roads of options where the mid\-way represents the center of guidance\. If he deviates from this point of moderation even a bit, tilting towards this way or that, there is nothing but sheer misguidance for him\. That mid\-way is that he should neither bend towards this world to such an extent that he ignores the next life, devoting himself entirely to this one, nor should he abstain from this world to the extent that he has no regard for nor interest in anything in it, confining himself to some corner, isolating himself from everyone\. Since Allah has created man and placed him in this world, man should follow the code of life for living in this world\. He should partake of the comforts and pleasures bestowed by Allah within moderate limits\. Eating and enjoying things made lawful by Allah does not go against Allah’s worship\. Rather, Allah has created these things for the very purpose that they should be enjoyed, and so that He would be thanked for providing them for mankind\. That is why those who were chosen and preferred by Allah from among all His servants lived in this world with others eating, drinking, marrying and fathering children just like all others\. They did not feel the need to turn their faces away from the people of this world and adopt a norm of life in the wilderness, in caves of mountains as their abodes, or in places distant from the public\. On the other hand, they remembered Allah, remained disentangled from worldly affairs and did not forget death despite the pleasures and comforts of this life\.

The life of asceticism sometimes produces such evils that ruin the next life for the “ascetic” person also as well as ruining this one\. Such an individual proves to be the true portrait of one who loses this life as well as the next\. When natural urges are not satisfied in the lawful and legal way, the mind turns into a center of evil\-insinuated ideas, becoming incapable of performing worship with peace and concentration\. And sometimes passions overcome the ascetic to the extent that he would break all moral fetters, devoting himself completely to their satisfaction\. Consequently, man falls into an abyss of ruin from which it is impossible

<a id="page690"></a>to extract himself\. That is why religious laws accord a greater status to the worship performed by a family man than that by a non\-family man because the former can exercise mental peace and concentration in the worship and rituals\.

Individuals who put on the cloak of Sufism and make a loud show of their spiritual greatness are cut off from the path of Islam and are ignorant of its wide teachings\. They have been misled by Satan and, relying on their self\-formed concepts, tread wrongful paths\. Eventually, their misguidance becomes so serious that they begin to regard their leaders as having attained such a level that their word is like the word of Allah, and their deed is as though that of Allah\.\.\. Sometimes, they regard themselves as being beyond all the bounds and limitations of religious laws, considering every evil deed as lawful for them\. This deviation from the faith and creed is labeled as Sufism\. Its unlawful principles are called tariqah \(way of achieving communion with Allah\) and the followers of this cult are known as Sufis\. First, Abu Hashim al\-Kufi al\-Shami adopted this title\. He was of an Umayyad descent and a fatalist \(believing that man is bound to act as pre\-ordained by Allah\)\. The reason for giving him this name was that in order to make a show of his asceticism and fear of Allah, he put on a woolen cloak\. Later on, this title became common and various grounds were put forth as the bases of this name\. For example, one ground is that sufi has three letters: the sad, waw and fa’\. Sad stands for sabr, endurance, sidq, truthfulness, and safa, purity of heart\. The waw, according to them, stands for wudd, love or affection, wird \(repetition of Allah’s Name\) and wafa’, faithfulness to Allah\. The fa’ stands for fard, unity or oneness, faqr, poverty or destitution, and fana’, death or absorption in the Self of Allah\. The second view is that it has been derived from “as\- Suffah”, a platform near the Prophet’s mosque which had a covering of date\-palm leaves and which housed a number of poor and homeless companions of the Prophet \(k\)\. Those who stayed there

were called ashabus \-Suffah \(people of the platform\)\. The third view is that the name of the progenitor of an Arab tribe was Sufah and his tribe performed the duties of serving the pilgrims and the Ka\`ba, and it is with reference to their regard that this tribe and those people were called Sufis\. This group is divided among various sects but the basic sects are seven only as follows:

1. al\-Wahdatiyyah \(unitarian\): This sect believes in the oneness of all existence\. Its belief is that everything IN this world is Allah, so much so that they assign to even polluted things the same divine status\. They liken Allah with the river and the waves rising in it, arguing that the waves which sometimes rise and sometimes fall have no separate

<a id="page691"></a>existence other than the river, but their existence is exactly the existence of the river\. Therefore, nothing can be separated from its own existence\.

1. al\-Ittihayyah \(the unitists\): They believe that they have united with Allah and Allah has united with them\. They liken Allah with fire and themselves with iron that lies in the fire from which it acquires its form and quality\.
2. al\-Huluyyah \(the formists\): Their belief is that Allah takes the form of those who claim to know Him and the perfect ones and their bodies are places of His stay\. In this way, they are seemingly men but really Allah\.
3. al\-Wasiliyyah \(the combiners\): This sect considers itself to have combined with Allah\. Their belief is that the laws of the Shar’a are a means of development of the human personality and character and that when the human self combines with Allah, it no longer needs perfection or development\. Consequently, for the Wasilis, worship and ritual become useless because they hold that when truth/reality is achieved, the Shari\`a becomes irrelevant\. Therefore, they can do anything, and they cannot be questioned\.
4. az\-Zarraqiyyah \(the revelers\): This sect regards vocal and instrumental music as worship; it earns the pleasures of this world through a show of asceticism and from door to door begging\. They are ever engaged in relating concocted stories of miraculous performances of their leaders in order to impress the common people\.
5. al\-Ushshaqiyyah \(the lovers\): The theory of this sect is: Apparency is the means to reality, meaning that carnal love is the means to achieve the love of Allah\. That is, in order to reach the stage of Allah’s love, it is necessary to have love with a human beauty\. But the love which they regard as love for Allah is just the product of mental disorder through which the lover inclines to one individual with all his attention\. His final objective is to have access to the beloved one\. This love can lead to the way of evil and vice, but it has no connection with the love of Allah\.

A Persian couplet says: “The truth of the fact is that carnal desire is like a jinn, and a jinn cannot give you guidance\.”

1. at\-Talqiniyyah \(the encounterers\): According to this “sect”, the reading of religious sciences and books of scholarship is totally unlawful\.

<a id="page692"></a>Instead, the status that is achieved by an hour of spiritual effort of the Sufis cannot be achieved even by seventy years of book reading\.

According to Shi\`a ulema’, all these sects are on the wrong path and out of the fold of Islam\. In this regard, numerous sayings of the Imams are related\. In this sermon, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has

regarded the severance of Asim ibn Ziyad from this world as the mischief of Satan\. He strongly dissuaded him from adopting that course\. \(For further study, see Sharh Nahjul \-Balagha, al\-Hajj Mirza Habibullah a\-Khoei, Vol\. 13, pp\.132\-417; Vol\. 14, pp\. 2\-22\)\.
