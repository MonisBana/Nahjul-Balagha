**Sermon 72**

**When Marwan ibn al\-Hakam was taken captive during the Battle of the Camel \(Jamal\) in Basra, he asked Hassan and Hussain \(peace be upon them\) to intercede on his behalf before Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\. So they spoke to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) about**

**him and he released him\. Then they said, “O Imam Ali\! Marwan desires to swear his allegiance to you, whereupon Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said the following:**

Did he not swear me allegiance after the killing of Othman? Now I do not need his allegiance because his is the hand of a Jew\. If he swears me allegiance with his hand he would violate it after a short while\. Well, he is to get power for so long as a dog licks his nose\. He is the father of four rams \(who will also rule\)\. The people will face hard days through him and his sons\.

Marwan ibn al \-Hakam was the nephew and son\-in\-law of Othman\. Due to a thin body and tall stature he was known with the nickname “Khayt Batil” \(thread of falsehood\)\. When \`Abdul\-Malik ibn Marwan killed \`Amr ibn Sa’id al\-Ashdaq, his brother Yahya ibn Sa’id said the following: “O sons of Khayt al\-Batil \(the thread of wrongdoing\)\! You have played deceit on \`Amr and people like you build their houses \(of authority\) on deceit and treachery\.”

Although his father, al\- Hakam ibn Abul\-As, had accepted Islam at the time of the fall of Mecca, his behavior and activities caused a great deal of pain to the Prophet \(h\)\. Consequently, the Prophet \(h\) cursed

him and his descendants and said, “Woe will befall my people from the progeny of this man\.” At last in view of his increasing intrigues, the Prophet \(h\) exiled him from Medina towards the valley of Hajj \(in Ta’if\)

and Marwan also went with him\. Thereafter, the Prophet \(h\) did not

<a id="page449"></a>allow them to enter Medina as long as he was alive\. Abu Bakr and Umar did likewise, but Othman sent for both of them during his reign and raised Marwan to such a height as though the reins of caliphate rested in his hands\. Thereafter his circumstances became so favorable that on the death of Mu\`awiyah ibn Yazid he became the Caliph of the Muslims\. He had only ruled nine months and eighteen days before death overtook him in such a way that his wife sat with the pillow on his face and did not leave until he breathe d his last\.

The four sons to whom Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has referred

were the four sons of Abdul\-Malik ibn Marwan namely al\-Walid, Sulayman, Yazid and Hisham, who ascended the Caliphate one after the other and colored the, pp\. of history with their stories\. Some commentators have regarded this reference to Marwan’s own sons whose names are Abdul\-Malik, Abdul\-Aziz, Bishr and Muhammad \(h\)\. Out of

these Abdul \-Malik did become Caliph of Islam but Abdul\-Azaz became governor of Egypt, Bishr of Iraq and Muhammad of Jazira\.
