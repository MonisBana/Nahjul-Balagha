**Oppressiveness of the Umayyads:**

By Allah\! They will continue like this till there will remain no unlawful act before Allah except that they will make it lawful, nor a pledge except that they will break it and till there will remain no house of bricks or of woolen tent but their oppression will enter it\. Their bad dealings will make them wretched, till two groups of crying complainants will rise\. One will cry for his religion and the other for this world and the help of one of you to one of them will be like the help of a slave to his master, namely when he is present he obeys him, but when the master is away he backbites him\. The highest among you in distress will be he who bears best belief about Allah\. If Allah grants you safety accept it and if you are put in trouble endure it because surely \(good\) result is for the God\-fearing\.
