**Sermon 2**

**Delivered on return from Siffn before his Nomination by the Prophet \(h\) for the Caliphate**

I praise Allah, seeking completion of His Blessing, submitting to His Glory and expecting safety from committing His sins\. I invoke His help being in need of His Sufficiency \(of protection\)\. He whom He guides does not get astray\. He with whom He is hostile gets no protection\. He whom He supports does not remain needy\. Praise is most weighty of all that is weighed and the most valuable of all that is treasured\.

I testify that there is no god but Allah the One\. He has no like\. My testimony has been tested in its frankness and its essence shall store it facing the tribulations that overtake us because it is the foundation stone of Belief \(iman\) and the first step toward good actions and the Divine pleasure\. It is the means to keep Satan away\.

I also testify that Muhammad \(h\) is the Prophet\. Allah sent him with the illustrious religion, effective emblem, written Book,113effulgent light, sparkling gleam and decisive in junctions in order to dispel doubts, present clear proofs, administer warning through signs and to warn of punishments\. At that time people had fallen in vices whereby the rope of religion had been broken, the pillars of belief had been shaken, principles had been desecrated, system had become topsy turvy, openings were narrow, passage was dark, guidance was unknown

and darkness prevailed\.

Allah was being disobeyed, Satan was given support and Belief had been forsaken\. As a result the pillars of religion fell down, its traces could not be discerned, its passages had been destroyed and its streets had fallen into decay\. People obeyed Satan and tread his paths\. They sought

113This is a reference to the Preserved Tablet\.

<a id="page338"></a>water from his watering places\. Through them Satan’s emblems flew and his standard was raised in vices which trampled the people under their hoofs and treaded upon them with their feet\. The vices stood on their toes \(in full stature\) and the people immersed in them were strayed, perplexed, ignorant and seduced as though in a Good House114 with bad neighbors\. Instead of sleep, they had wakefulness, and for antinomy, they had tears in the eyes\. They were a land where the learned were in bridle \(keeping their mouths shut\) while the ignorant were honored\.

In the same sermon, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) referred to Ahl al\-

Bayt \(x\) \(the Household of the Holy Prophet \(h\)\) as follows:

They are the trustees of His secrets, shelter for His affairs, source of knowledge about Him, center of His wisdom, valleys for His books and mountains of His religion\. With them, Allah straightened the bend of religion’s back and removed the trembling of its limbs\.

In the same sermon, he spoke about the hypocrites thus:

They sowed vices, watered them with deception and harvested destruction\. Non in the Islamic community can be taken at par with the Progeny115

114The “Good House” means Mecca, while the “bad neighbors” phrase refers to unbelieving Quraishites\.

115About the Progeny of the Prophet \(h\), Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) has said

that nobody in the world can be at par with them, nor can anyone be deemed their equal in sublimity because the world is over laden with their obligations and has been able to secure eternal blessings only through their guidance\. They are the corner stone and foundation of religion and the sustenance for its life and survival\. They are such strong pillars of knowledge and belief that they can turn away the stormy flow of doubt and suspicion\. They are such middle course among the paths of excess and backwardness that if some one goes far toward excess and exaggeration or falls behind then unless he comes back or steps forward to that middle course, he cannot be on the path of Islam\. They possess all the characteristics which give the superiority in the right for vicegerency and leadership\. Consequently, no one else in the _umma_ enjoys the right of patronage and guardianship\. That is why the Prophet \(h\) declared them his vicegerents and

successors\. About will and succession the commentator ibn Abul\-Hadid, the Mu’tazilite scholar, writes that there can be no doubt about the vicegerency of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) but succession cannot imply succession in status although the

Shi\`ite sect has so interpreted it\. It rather implies succession of learning\. Now, if according to him succession is taken to imply succession in learning even he does

<a id="page339"></a>of the Prophet \(h\) \(Ahl al\-Bayt \[x\]\)\. One who was under their obligation

cannot be matched with them\. They are the foundation of religion and the pillar of belief\. The forward runner has to turn back to them while the follower has to overtake them\. They possess the chief characteristics for vicegerency\. In their favor exists the will and succession \(of the Prophet \(h\)\)\. This is the time when right has returned to its owner and diverted to

its center of return\.
