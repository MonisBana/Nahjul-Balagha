**Masqalah Ibn Hubayrah ash\-Shaybani Fled to Mu\`awiyah Because He Had Purchased Some Prisoners of BanÅ Najiyah from an Executive of Amir Al\-Mu’minin \(x\), but When He Demanded the**

**Price, the Latter Avoided and Ran to Syria\. Amir Al\-Mu’minin \(x\)**

**Said:**

May Masqalah be condemned\. He acted like the noble but fled like a slave\. Before his admirer could speak \(about him\) he silenced him and before his eulogist could testify to his good deeds he closed his mouth\. If he had stayed behind we would have taken from him what he could easily pay and waited for the balance till his money increased\.

Following the “arbitration”, the Kharijites rose in defiance\. A Kharijite man of Banu Najiyah named al\-Khirrit ibn Rashid an\- Naji began instigating people and set off towards al\-Mada’in with a group killing and marauding\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) sent Ziyad ibn Khasafah with three

hundred men to check him\. When the two forces met at al \-Mada’in they attacked each other with swords\. Only one encounter or so had taken place when the gloom of evening prevailed and the battle had to be stopped\. When morning appeared Ziyad’s men noticed that five dead bodies of the Kharijites were lying and they themselves had cleared off the battlefield\. Seeing this Ziyad set off for Basra along with his men\. There he came to know that the Kharijites had gone to Ahwaz\. Ziyad did not move onwards for paucity of force and informed Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) of it\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) called back Ziyad and sent Ma\`qil ibn

Qays ar\-Riyahi with two thousand experienced combatants towards Ahwaz and wrote to the governor of Basra \`Abdullah ibn Abbas to send two thousand swordsmen of Basra for the help of Ma\`qil\. Consequently, the contingent from Basra also joined them at Ahwaz and after proper organization, they got ready to attack the enemy\. But al\-Khirrit marched

<a id="page425"></a>on along with his men to the hills of Ramhurmuz\. These people also followed him and overtook him near these hills\. Both arrayed their forces and started attacking each other\. The result of this encounter was that three hundred and seventy Kharijites were killed in the battlefield while the rest ran away\. Ma\`qil informed Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) of his

performance and of the enemy’s defeat when Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)

directed him to chase them and to disintegrate their power so that they should not be able to raise heads again\. On receipt of this order, Ma\`qil moved on and overtook him on the coast of the Persian Gulf, where al\-Khirrit had by persuasion secured the cooperation of the people and enlisting men from here and the re, had collected a considerable force\. When Ma\`qil reached the re, he raised the flag of peace and announced that those who had collected from here and there should flee\. They would not be assaulted\. The effect of this announcement was that save for al\-Khirrit’s own community all others deserted him\. He organized those very men and commenced the battle but valorous combatants of Basra and Kufa displayed such excellent use of swords that in a short time one hundred and seventy men of the insurgents were killed while an\-Nu’man ibn Suhban ar\-Rasibi encountered al\-Khirrit \(ibn Rashid an\-Naji\) and eventually attacked and killed him\. Soon after his fall the enemy lost ground an d they fled from the battlefield\. Thereafter, Ma\`qil collected all themen, women and children from their camps at one place\. From among them those who were Muslims were released after swearing allegiance\. Those who had turned heretics were called upon to re \-embrace their Submission to the Will of Allah \(Islam\)\. Consequently all except one old Christian secured their release by accepting Islam but the old man was killed\. Then, Ma\`qil took with him those Christians of Banu Najiyah who had taken part in this rebellion together with their families\. When Ma\`qil reached Ardashir Khurrah \(a city of Iran\) these prisoners wailed and cried before its governor Masqalah ibn Hubayrah ash\-Shaybani and beseeched in all humility to do something for their release\. Masqalah sent word to Ma\`qil through Dhuhl ibn al\-Harith to sell these prisoners to him\. Ma\`qil agreed and sold those prisoners to him for five hundred thousand Dirhams and told him to dispatch the price immediately to Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)\.

He said that he was sending the first installment at once and the remaining installments would also be sent soon\. When Ma\`qil met Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) he related the whole event before him\. Amir al\-Mu’minin

\(x\) ratified this action and waited for the price for some time, but Masqalah observed such deep silence as if nothing was due from him\. At last Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) sent a messenger to him with word to either send the price or to come himself\. On Amir al\-Mu’minin’s order he came

<a id="page426"></a>to Kufa and on demand of the price paid two hundred thousand Dirhams\. But, to evade the balance he went to Mu\`awiyah, who made him the governor of Tabaristan\. When Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) came to know all

this he spoke these words \(as in this sermon\) \. Its sum total is that: Had he stayed, we would have been considerate to him in demanding the price and would have waited for an improvement of his financial condition\. But he fled like slaves after displaying a showy act\. Talk about his high perseverance had just started when people began to discuss his baseless and lowliness\.
