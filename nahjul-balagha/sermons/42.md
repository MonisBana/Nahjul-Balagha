**About Heart’s Desires and Extended Hopes**

O people what I fear most about you are two things \- acting according to desires and the extending of hopes\. Acting according to \(personal\) desires prevents \(the experiential admission of\) truth; regarding extensive hope, it makes one forget the next world\. You should know this world is moving rapidly and nothing has remained out of it except the last particles like the dregs of a vessel which has been emptied by some one\. Beware, the next world is advancing and either of them has sons i\.e\. followers\. You should become sons of the next world and not become sons of this world because on the Day of Judgement every son would cling to his mother\. Today is the Day of action and there is no reckoning while tomorrow is the Day of reckoning wherein there would be no \(opportunity for\) action\.

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “Al\-hadhadha means rapid, but some people have read it jadhdha\. According to this version, the meaning, it could be that the cycle of worldly enjoyments would end soon\.
