**Sermon 137**

**Referring to Future Events**

He will direct desires towards \(the path of\) guidance while people will have turned guidance towards desires and he will turn their views to the direction of the Holy Quran while the people will have turned the Holy Quran to their views\.

**Part of the same sermon:**

Before this Enjoiner of Allah166, matters will deteriorate till war will rage among you with full force, showing forth its teeth, with udders full of sweet milk but with a sour tip\. Beware, it will be tomorrow and the morrow will come soon with things which you do not know\. The man in power, not from this crowd, will take to task all those were formerly appointed for their ill deeds and the earth will pour forth its internal treasures and fling before him easily her keys\. He will show you the just way of behavior and revive the Holy Quran and Sunnah which have become lifeless \(among people\)\.

166This prediction of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) is with regard to the appearance of the Twelfth Imam, Abul\-Qasim Muhammad ibn al\-Hassan, al\-Mahdi \(x\)\.

As if I see \(him\), he \(the Enjoiner of Evil\)167 is shouting in Syria and is extending his banners to the outskirts of Kufa\. He is bent towards it like the biting of the she\-camel\. He has covered the ground with heads\. His mouth is wide open and \(the trampling of\) his footsteps on the ground have become heavy\. His advance is broad and his attacks are severe\.

By Allah, he will disperse you throughout the earth till only a few of you remain, like kohl in the eye\. You will continue like this till the Arabs return to their sense\. You should, therefore, stick to established ways, clear signs and the early period which has the lasting virtues of the Prophethood\. You should know that Satan makes his ways easy so that you may follow him on his heels\.
