**About Islam :**

The best means by which seekers of nearness to Allah, the Glorified One, the Exalted, seek nearness, is the belief in Him and His Prophet \(h\), fighting in His cause, for it is the high pinnacle of Islam and

\(to believe\) in kalimatul\-ikhlas \(the expression of the Divine purification\)\. It is a just nature and the establishment of prayer for it is \(the basis of\) community\. The payment of zakat for it is a compulsory obligation, fasting for the month of Ramadan for it is the shield against chastisement\. The performance of hajj to the House of Allah \(i\.e\. The Ka\`ba\) and its \`umrah \(other than annual visit\) for these two acts banish poverty and

<a id="page510"></a>wash away sins\. Regard for kinship for it increases wealth and length of life\. Giving alms secretly for it covers shortcomings, giving alms openly for it protects against a bad death and extending benefits \(to people\) for it saves from positions of disgrace\.

**About the Holy Quran and the Sunnah:**

Go ahead with the remembrance of Allah for it is the best remembrance and long for that which He has promised to the pious, for His promise is the most true promise\. Tread the course of the Prophet \(h\) for it is the most distinguished course\. Follow the Sunnah of the Prophet \(h\) for it is the most right of all behaviors\. Learn the Holy Quran for it is

the fairest of discourses and understand it thoroughly for it is the best blossoming of hearts\. Seek cure with its light for it is the cure for hearts\. Recite it beautifully for it is the most beautiful narration\. Certainly, a scholar who acts not according to his knowledge is like the off \-headed ignorant who does not find relief from his ignorance; but on the learned the plea of Allah is greater and grief more incumbent and he is more blameworthy before Allah\.
