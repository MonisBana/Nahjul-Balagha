**Causes of Differences in the Features and Traits of People**

Di’bil al\-Yamami has related from Ahmed ibn Qutaybah, and the latter from Abdullah ibn Yazid, and he from Malik ibn Dihyah who said, “We were with Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) when a discussion arose about the differences among men \(in features and conduct\), so Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said the following:

They differ among themselves because of the sources of their clay \(from which they have been created\)\. This is so because they are either from salty soil or sweet soil or from rugged earth or soft earth\. They resemble each other on the basis of the affinity of their soil and differ according to its difference\. Therefore, sometimes a person of handsome features is weak in intelligence, a tall stature person is of low courage, a virtuous person is ugly in appearance, a short stature person is far\-sighted, a good\-natured person has an evil trait, a person of perplexed heart has a bewildering mind and a sharp\-tongued person has a wakeful heart\.

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has ascribed the differences in

features and characters of people to the differences in the clay from which they are created and according to which their features are shaped and their characters are formed\. Therefore, to the extent that their clay of origin is akin, their mental and imaginative tendencies, too, will be similar, and to the extent by which they differ, there will be a difference in their inclinations and tendencies\. By “origins” of a thing are meant those things on which its coming into existence depends, but they do not have to be its cause\. The word “teen” is the plural of “teenah” which means “origin” or “basis”\. Here, “teenah” means semen which, after passing through various stages of development, emerges into a human shape\. Its origin means those constituents from which those items are created which help in the formation of semen\. Thus, by salty, sweet, soft or hard soil, the reference is to these elementary ingredients\. Since those elementary ingredients carry different properties, the semen growing out of them will also bear different characteristics and propensities which will \(eventually\) show forth in the differences in features and in the conduct of those born out of it\.

Ibn Abul\-Hadid has written \(in Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 13, p\.

1. that the phrase “origins of teenah” implies those preservative factors which are different in their properties as Plato and other philosophers

<a id="page727"></a>have held\. The reason for calling them “origins of teenah” is that they serve as an asylum for the human body and prevent the elements from diffusion\. Just as the existence of a thing hinges on its essence, in the same way the existence of this body, which is made up of elements, depends on preservative factors\. So long as the preservative factor exists, the body, too, is safe from disruption and disintegration and the elements are also immune to diffusion and dispersal\. When it leaves the body, the elements also get dispersed\.

According to this explanation, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s words will mean that Allah has created different original elements of which some are vicious and some are virtuous, some are weak and some are strong\. Every person will act according to his/her original element\. If there is any similarity in the inclinations of two persons, it is attributed to their original element\. In it, they are similar\. And when their tendencies differ, it is because their original elements are not similar\. But this conclusion is not correct because Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s words do not only refer to differences in conduct and behavior but also in features and shapes\. The differences of features and shapes cannot be the result of differences in original elements\.

In any case, whether the original elements make up the cause of differences in features and in one’s conduct, or whether the elementary ingredients are the cause, these words appear to lead to the negation or volition \[of such an assumption\]\. They attempt to prove the dominance, the upper\-hand, \(of destiny\) over human actions\. If man’s capacity for thinking and acting is dependent on one’s “teenah”, then he will be compelled to behave himself in a fixed way on account of which he will neither deserve praise for good deeds nor be held blameworthy for bad ones\. But this hypothe sis is incorrect because it is well established that just as Allah knows everything in creation after its coming into being, in the same way, He knew it before its creation\. Thus, He knew what actions man would perform of his free will and what he could leave\. Therefore, Allah gave him the ability to act according to his free will and created him from a suitable “teenah”\. This “teenah” is not the cause of his actions so as to snatch away from him his free will\. But the meaning of creating from suitable “teenah” is that Allah does not by force stand in man’s way but allows him to tread the path which he wants of his own free will\.
