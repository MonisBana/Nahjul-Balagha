**Sermon 40**

**When Amir Al\-Mu’minin \(x\) Heard the Cry of Kharijites That Verdict Is Only That of Allah, He Said:**

The statement is right, but what \(they think\) it means is wrong\. It is true that verdict lies but with Allah, but these people say that \(the function of\) governance is only for Allah\. The fact is that there is no escape for men from rulers\_\_good or bad\. The faithful persons perform \(good\) acts in his rule while the unfaithful enjoys \(worldly\) benefits in it\. During the rule, Allah would carry everything to end\. Through the ruler tax is collected, the enemy is fought, roadways are protected and the right of the weak is taken from the strong till the virtuous enjoy peace and allowed protection from \(the oppression of\) the wicked\.

**Another version of the same sermon:**

When Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) heard the cry of the Khirijites on the

aforementioned verdict he said: “I am expecting the verdict \(destiny\) of Allah on you\. Then he went on to say, As for good government, the pious man performs good deeds in it, while in a bad government the wicked person enjoys till his time is over and death overtakes him\.
