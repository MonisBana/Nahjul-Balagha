**Sermon 133**

**Delivered when Umar ibn al\-Khattab consulted Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) about himself, taking part in the march towards Rome \(Byzantine Empire\) \.**

Allah has taken upon Himself for the followers of this religion the strengthening of boundaries and hiding of the secret places\. Allah helped them when they were few and could not protect themselves\. He is living and will not die\. If you will yourself proceed towards the enemy and clash with them and fall into some trouble, there will be no place of refuge for the Muslims other than their remote cities, nor any place they will return to\. Therefore, you should send there an experienced man and send with him people of good performance who are well\-intentioned\. If Allah grants you victory, then this is what you want\. If it is otherwise, you will serve as a support for the people and a returning place for the Muslims\.

About Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), the strange status is adopted

that on the one hand, it is said that he was ignorant of practical politics and unacquainted with ways of administration from which it is intended that the rebellions created by the Umayyad’s lust for power should be shown to be the outcome of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s weak administration\. On the other hand, much is made of the various occasion when the then Caliphs consulted Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) in important

affairs of State in the matter of wars with unbelievers\. The aim in this is not to exhibit his correctness of thinking and judgement of deep sagacity but to show that there was unity and concord between him and the Caliphs so that attention should not be paid to the fact that in some matters they also differed and that mutual clashes had also occurred\. History shows that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) did have differences of

principles with the Caliphs and did not approve every step of theirs\. In the

<a id="page548"></a>sermon of ash\-Shaqshaqiyya he has expressed in loud words his difference of opinion and anger about each regime\. Nevertheless, this difference does not mean that correct guidance should be withheld in collective Islamic problems\. Again, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s character was so high that no one could imagine that he will ever evade giving counsel which concerned the common wealth, or will give such counsel which will damage public interests\. That is why, despite differences of principles, he was consulted\. This throws light on the greatness of his character and the correctness of his thinking and judgement\. Similarly, it is a prominent trait of the Holy Prophet’s character that despite rejecting his claim to Prophethood the unbelievers acknowledged him the best trustee and could never doubt his trustworthiness\. Rather, even during clashes of mutual opposition they entrusted to him their property without fear and never suspected that their property will be misappropriated\. Similarly, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) was held to occupy so high a status

of trust and confidence that friend and foe both trusted in the correctness of his counsel\. So, just as the Prophet’s conduct shows his height of trustworthiness and just as it cannot be inferred from it that there was mutual accord between him and the unbelievers because trust has its own place while the clash of Islam and unbelief has another, in the same way, despite having differences with the Caliphs, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

was regarded as the protector of national and community interests and as the guardian of Islam’s well\-being and prosperity\. Thus when national interests were involved he was consulted and he tendered his unbiased advice raising himself above personal ends and keeping in view the Prophet’s tradition to the effect that “He who is consulted is a trustee never allowed any dishonesty or duplicity or interfere\. When on the occasion of the battle of Palestine, the \`Umar consulted him about his taking part in it himself, then, irrespective of whether or not his opinion will accord with \`Omer’s feelings, he kept in view Islam’s prestige and existence and counseled him to stay in his place and to send to the battle\-front such a man who should be experienced and well \-versed in the are of fighting because the going of an inexperienced man will have damaged the established prestige of Islam and the awe in which the Muslims were held which had existed from the Prophet’s days will have vanished\. In fact, in the Omer’s going there Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) saw signs of

defeat and vanquishment\. He, therefore, found Islam’s interest to lie in detaining him and indicated his view in the words that:\.

If you have to retreat from the battlefield, it will not be your personal defeat only, but the Muslims will lose heart by it and leave the battlefield and disperse here and there because with the officer in

<a id="page549"></a>command leaving the field the army too will lose ground\. Furthermore, with the center being without the Caliph there will be no hope of any further assistance from behind which could sustain courage of the combatants\.

This is that counsel which is put forth as a proof of mutual accord, although this advice was tendered in view of Islam’s prestige and life which was dearer to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) than any other

interest\. No particular individual’s life was dear to him for which he might have advised against participation in the battle\.
