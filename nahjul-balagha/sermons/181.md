**Sermon 181**

**It has been related by Nawf al\-Bikali that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) delivered this sermon at Kufa standing on a stone which Ja’dah ibn Hubayrah al\-Makhzumi had placed for him\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had a woollen apparel on his body, the belt of his**

**sword was made of leaves and the sandals on his feet too were of palm leaves\. His forehead had a hardened spot like that a camel \(on its knee, due to many and long prostrations\)\. About Allah’s attributes, His creatures and His being above physical limitations :**

whereupon Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said the following: “You should first

take into account the grounds underlying this Arbitration and discuss it with me\. If you are satisfied, do as you will\.” He said he would return the next day to discuss the matter\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) then cautioned him thus: “Look,

upon going from here, do not get mislead by others, and do not adopt any other course\. If you have the will to understand, I will get you out of this wrong path and put you on the course of guidance\.” After this conversation, the man went away, but his countenance indicated that he was bent on rebelling and that he would not see reason by any means\. And so it happened\. He stuck to his point\. Having reached his place, he said to his tribesmen, “Since we are determined to abandon Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), there is no use going to him\. We should

do what we have decided to do\.” On this occasion, Abdullah ibn Qu’ayn al\-Azdi also went to them to inquire\. But when he came to know the situation, he asked Mudrik ibn ar\-Rayyan an\-Naji to speak to him and to advise him of the ruinous consequence of this rebellion, whereupon Mudrik assured him that this man would not be allowed to take any step\. Consequently, \`Abdullah came back satisfied and related the whole matter to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) on

returning the next day\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said, “Let us see what happens when he comes\.” But when the appointed hour passed and the man did not turn up, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) asked Abdullah to go and see what the matter was and what the cause for the delay was\. On reaching there, Abdullah found that all of them had left\. When he returned to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\),

the Imam delivered this sermon\. The fate that befell al\-Khirrit ibn Rashd an\-Naji has been stated in Sermon 44\.

<a id="page619"></a>Praise be to Allah to Whom is the return of all creation and the end of all matters\. We render Him praise for the greatness of His generosity, the charity of His proofs, the increase of His bounty\.\.\. And for His favors, a praise which may fulfil His right, repay His thanks, take \(us\) near His reward and produce an increase in His kindness\. We seek His help like one who is hopeful of His bounty, desirous of His benefit and confident of His warding \(calamities\) off, one who acknowledges His gifts and is obedient to Him in word and in deed\. We believe in Him like one who reposes hope in Him with conviction, inclines to Him as a believer, humbles himself before Him obediently, believes in His Oneness exclusively, regards Him as great, acknowledging His dignity and seeks refuge with Him with inclination and exertion\.

Allah, the most Glorified One, has not been born so that someone could be \(His\) partner in glory\. Nor has He begotten anyone so as to be inherited\. Time has not preceded Him\. Increase and decrease do not apply to Him\. But He has manifested Himself to our understanding when we observe His strong control and firm decree\. Among the proofs of His creation is the creation of the skies which are fastened without pillars, standing without support\. He called them and they responded obediently and humbly without being reluctant or loathsome\. If they had not acknowledged His being the Lord and not obeyed Him, He would not have made them the place for His throne, the abode of His angels and the destination of the pure utterances and righteous deeds of the creatures\.

He has made the stars in the skies by way of signs for the guidance of travelers who traverse the various routes of the earth\. The gloom of the dark curtains of the night does not prevent the flame of their light, nor do the veils of blackish nights have the power to turn back the light of the moon when it spreads in the skies\. Glory to Allah from Whom neither the blackness of dark dusk nor of gloomy nights in the low parts of the earth or on high dim mountains is hidden, nor the thundering of clouds on the horizons of the skies, nor the sparking of lightning in the clouds, nor the falling of leaves blown away from their falling places by the winds of hurricanes or by downpour from the sky\. He knows where the drops fall and where they settle, where the grubs leave their trails or drag themselves, what livelihood will suffice the mosquitoes and what a female bears in its womb\.

<a id="page620"></a>Praise be to Allah Who exists before the existence of the seat, the throne, the sky, the earth, the jinns or the humans\. He cannot be perceived by imagination nor measured by comprehension\. He who pleads to Him does not divert Him \(from others\), nor does giving away cause Him diminution\. He does not see by means of an eye, nor can He be confined to a place\. He cannot be said to have companions\. He does not create with \(the help of\) limbs\. He cannot be perceived by senses\. He cannot be thought of as we think of people\.

It is He who spoke to Musa \(Moses\) clearly and showed Him His great signs without the use of bodily parts, the means of speech or the uvula\. O you who exert yourself in describing Allah\! If you are serious, then \(first try to\) describe Gabriel, Michael or the host of angels who are close \(to Allah\) in the receptacles of sublimity\. But their heads are bent downwards and their wits are perplexed as to how to assign limits \(of definition\) to the Highest Creator\. This is so because those things can only be perceived through qualities which have shape and parts and which succumb to death after reaching the end of their times\. There is no god but He\. He has lighted every darkness with His glory and has darkened every light with the darkness \(of death\)\.

**An Account of Bygone Peoples and Learning from Them**

I admonish you, servants of Allah, to fear Allah Who clothed you well and bestowed upon you an abundance of sustenance\. If there was anyone who could secure a ladder to everlasting life or a way to avoid death, it was Sulayman ibn Dawud \(x\) \[Solomon son of David\] who was

given control over the domain of the jinns and men along with Prophethood and a great status with Allah\. But when he exhausted appointed ration \(of this world\) and his \(fixed\) time expired, the bow of destruction shot him with an arrow of death\. His mansions became vacant and his habitations became empty\. Another group of people inherited them\. Certainly, the by\-gone centuries have a lesson for you\.

Where are the Amalekites181 and the sons of the Amalekites?

Where are the Pharaohs?182 But when his empire in the end was

181History shows that very often the ruin and destruction of peoples has been due to their oppression and open wickedness and profligacy\. Consequently, communities which had extended their sway over all the corners of the populated world and had flown their flags in the East and West of the globe disappeared from the surface of the earth like a wrong word, on disclosure of their vicious actions and evil doings\. The Amalekites were ancient nomadic

<a id="page621"></a>destroyed in a few moments\. Neither his status nor his servants could come in the way of its destruction, nor could the vastness of his realm

tribesmen, or a group of tribes, described in the Old Testament as relentless enemies of Israel, even though they were closely related to Ephraim, one of the twelve tribes of Israel\. Their name is derived from Amalek, who is celebrated in Arabian tradition but cannot be identified\. The region over which they ruled extended from southern Judea and probably extended into northern Arabia\. The Amalekites harassed the Hebrews during the latter’s exodus from Egypt, attacking them at Rephidim \(near Mt\. Sinai\), where they were defeated by Joshua\. They also filled out the ranks of the nomadic raiders defeated by Gideon and were condemned to annihilation by Samuel\. The Amelekites, whose final defeat occurred in the time of Hezekiah, were the object of a perpetual curse\. \(See _The New Encyclopedia Britannica_ \[Micropedia\], Vol\. 1, p\. 288, ed\. 1973 \- 1974\]; also see \[for further reference\] the _Encyclopedia Americana_ \[International Edition\] Vol\. 1, p\. 651, ed\. 1975\)\.

182“Pharaoh” is a Hebrew word form of the Egyptian “per\-Ao”, the great house, signifying the royal palace, an epithet applied in the new Kingdom and after, as a title of respect, to the Egyptian king himself\. In the 22nd dynasty, this title was added to the king’s personal name\. In official documents, the full titulary of the Egyptian king contained five names\. The first and the oldest identified him as the incarnation of the falcon god Horus\. It was often written inside a square called ‘serekh”, depicting the facade of the archaic palace\. The second name, “two ladies”, placed him under the protection of Nekh\-bet and Buto, the vulture and Uraeus \(snake\) goddesses of Upper and Lower Egypt\. The third, “golden Horus”, originally signified perhaps Horus victorious over his enemies\. The last two names, written within a ring or cartouche, are generally referred to as the praenomen and nomen and were the ones most commonly used\. The praenomen, preceded by the hieroglyph meaning “King of Upper and Lower Egypt”, usually contained a reference to the king’s Unique relationship with the sun god, Re, while the fifth, or nomen, was preceded by the hieroglyph for “son of Re”, or by that for Master of the Two Lands\. The last name was given him at birth, the rest at his coronation\. \(_The New Encyclopedia Britannica_ \[Micropodia\], Vol\. VII, p\. 927, ed\. 1973\-1974; also see \[for further reference\] the _Encyclopedia Americana_, \[International Edition\], Vol\. 21, p\. 707, ed\. 1975\)\.

Among the Pharaohs was Pharaoh who was contemporary to Prophet Musa \(x\)\. His pride, egotism, insolence and haughtiness were such that by

making the claim “I am your supreme god,” he deemed himself to be holding sway over all other powers of the world\. He was confused into misunderstanding that no power could wrest the realm and government from his hands\. The Holy Quran has narrated his claim of “I and no one else” in the following verse: _And Pharaoh proclaimed to his people: “O my people\! Is not_ _the kingdom of Egypt mine? And these rivers flow below me; What\! behold you not? \(Holy Quran 43: 51\)_

<a id="page622"></a>prevent it\. Rather, the waves of the very streams of which he was extremely proud, wrapped him in and dispatched his soul to Hell, throwing the body on the bank to serve as a lesson for the whole of creation\. Where are the people of the cities of ar\-Rass183 who killed the prophets, destroyed the traditions of the holy messengers and revived the traditions of the despots? Where are those who advanced with armies, defeated thousands, mobilized forces and populated cities?

**Part of the same sermon about Imam al\-Mahdi \(x\)**

He will be wearing the amour of wisdom, which he will have secured with all its conditions, such as full attention towards it, \(complete\) knowledge of and exclusive devotion to it\. For him, it is like a thing which he had lost and which he was then seeking, or a need which he was trying to fulfil\. If Islam is in trouble, he will feel forlorn like a traveler and like a \(tired\) camel beating the end of its tail, with its neck flattened on the ground\. He is the last of Allah’s proofs and one of the vicegerents of His prophets\.

**On the Method of His Ruling and Grief over the Martyrdom of His Companions**

O people\! I have divulged to you advice which the prophets used to preach to their peoples, and I have conveyed to you what the vicegerents \(of the prophets\) conveyed for the benefit of those coming after them\. I tried to train you with my whip but you could not be straightened\. I drove you with admonition but you did not acquire proper behavior\. May Allah deal with you\! Do you want an Imam other than me to take you on the \(right\) path and show you the correct way?

Beware, the things in this world which were forward have become things of the past, and those which were behind are going ahead\.

183Who were the people of the cities of ar\-Rass? In the same way as above, the people of ar\-Rass were killed and destroyed for disregarding the preaching and the call of their prophet and for their rebellion and disobedience\. About them the Holy Qur’an says the following: _And the \(tribes of\)_ _\}d and_ _Thamud, and the inhabitants of ar\-Rass, and generations between them, in great number\. And unto each of them We did give examples and everyone \(of them\) We did destroy with utter destruction \(Holy Quran 25: 38,39\); Belied \(also\) before them were the people of Noah and the dwellers of ar\-Rass and Thamud, and \}d and Pharaoh, and the brethren of Lot, and the dwellers of the Wood and the people of Tubba’; all belied the Messengers, so My promise \(of the doom\)was proved true \(Holy Quran 50: 12\-14\)\._

<a id="page623"></a>The virtuous people of Allah have made up their minds to leave and they have traded, with a little perishable \(pleasure\) of this world, a lot of such \(reward\) in the next world that will remain forever\. What loss did our brothers, whose blood was shed in Siffin, suffer by not being alive today? Only that they are not suffering from choking upon swallowing and not drinking turbid water\. By Allah, surely they have met Allah and He has bestowed upon them their rewards; He has lodged them in safe houses after their \(having suffered\) fear\.

Where are my brethren who took the \(right\) path and trod in righteousness/ Where is Ammar? Where is ibn at\-Tayyihan? Where is Dhul\-Shahadatayn? And where are others like them7 from among their comrades who had pledged themselves to remain steadfast till death and whose \(severed\) heads were taken to the wicked enemy?

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) wiped his hand over his auspicious, honored beard and wept for a long time, then he went on to say:

O brothers who recited the Holy Quran and strengthened it, thought over their obligation and fulfilled it, revived the Sunnah and destroyed innovation\! When they were called to jihad, they responded and trusted in their leader then followed him\.

**Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Shouted the Following at the Top of His Voice:**

Al\-Jihad, al\- Jihad\! O servants of Allah\! By Allah, I am mobilizing the army today\. He who desires to proceed towards Allah should come forward\.

Nawf says the following: “Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) put Hussain \(x\) in charge of \(a force of\) ten thousand, Qays ibn Sa\`d \(mercy

of Allah be upon him\) over ten thousand, Abu Ayyub al\-Ansari over ten thousand and others over different numbers, intending to return to Siffin\. But on Friday, the Imam \(x\) did not appear in public again; the damned

Ibn Muljim \(may Allah curse him\) killed him\. Consequently, the armies came back and were left like sheep who had lost their shepherd while wolves were snatching them away from all sides\.

Ammar ibn Yasir ibn Amir al\-Madhhaji al\-Makhzumi \(Madhhaj being an ally of Banu Makhzum\) was one of the earliest converts to Islam and the first Muslim to build a mosque in his own house in which he used

<a id="page624"></a>to worship Allah \(Al\-Tabaqat, Vol\. 3, Part 1, p\. 178; Usd al\-Ghabah, Vol\.

4, p\. 46; Ibn Kathir, Tarikh, Vol\. 7, p\.311\)\.

Ammar accepted Islam along with his father Yasir and his mother Sumayya\. They suffered great atrocities at the hands of the tribesmen of Quraish due to their conversion to Islam to such an extent that Ammar lost his parents, and they were the first martyrs in Islam\.

Ammar was among those who immigrated to Abyssinia and the earliest immigrants \(Muhajirun\) to Medina\. He was present in the battle of Badr and all other battles as well as places of assembly by the Muslims during the lifetime of the Holy Prophet \(h\)\. He demonstrated his mighty support in all Islamic struggles in the best way\.

Many traditions are narrated from the Holy Prophet \(h\) about

Ammar regarding his virtues, outstanding traits and glorious deeds such as the tradition which Aisha and others have narrated that the Holy Prophet \(h\) himself had said that Ammar was filled with faith from the

crown of his head to the soles of his feet\. \(Ibn Majah, Sunan, Vol\. 1, p\. 65; Abu Nu’aym, Hilyat al\-Awliya’, Vol\. 1, p\. 139; al\-Haytami, Majma’ az\-Zawa’id, Vol\. 9, p\.295; Al\-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 3, p\. 1137; Al\-Isaba, Vol\. 2, p\. 512\)\.

In another tradition, the Holy Prophet \(h\) said the following about Ammar:\.

“Ammar is with the truth and the truth is with Ammar\. He turns wherever the truth turns\. Ammar is as close to me as an eye is close to the nose\. Alas\! A rebellious group will kill him” \(Al\-Tabaqat, Vol\. 3, part 1, p\. 187; Al\- Mustadrak, Vol\. 3, p\. 392; Ibn Hisham, Sira, Vol\. 2, p\. 143; Ibn Kathir, Tarikh, Vol\. 7, pp\. 268\-270\)\.

Also in the decisive and widely known tradition which al\-Bukhari \(in his Sahih, Vol\. 8, pp\. 185 \-186\), at\-Tirmithi \(in Al\- Jami’ Sahih, Vol\. 5, p\. 669\); Ahmed ibn Hanbal \(in Al\- Musnad, Vol\. 2, pp\. 161, 164, 206; Vol\. 3, pp\. 5, 22, 28, 91; Vol\. 4, pp\. 197, 199; Vol\. 5, pp\. 215, 306, 307; Vol\. 6, pp\. 289, 300, 311, 315\) and all the narrators of Islamic traditions and historians transmitted through twenty\-five Companions that the Holy Prophet \(h\) said the following about Ammar:\.

“Alas\! A rebellious group which swerves from the truth will murder Ammar\. Ammar will be calling them towards Paradise and they

<a id="page625"></a>will be calling him towards Hell\. His killer and those who strip him of arms and clothing will all be in Hell\.”

Ibn Hajar al\- Asqalani \(in Tahthib al\-Tahthib, Vol\. 7, p\. 409; Al\-Isaba, Vol\. 2, p\.512\) and al\-Sayyuti \(in Al\-Khasa’is al\-Kubra, Vol\. 2, p\.

1. say: “The narration of this \(above mentioned\) tradition is mutawatir \(i\.e\. narrated successively by so many people that no doubt can be entertained about its authenticity\)\.

Ibn Abdul\-Barr \(in Al\-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 3, p\. 1140\) says the following:\.

“The narration followed uninterrupted succession from the Holy Prophet \(h\) saiying the following: “A rebellious group will murder

Ammar,” and this is a prediction of the Prophet’s secret knowledge and the sign of his Prophethood\. This tradition is among the most authentic and the most rightly ascribed traditions\.

After the death of the Holy Prophet \(h\), Ammar was one of the closest adherents and best supporters of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

during the reign of the first three Caliphs\. During the caliphate of Othman when the Muslim population protested against Othman’s policy regarding a number of issues including the distribution of the Public Treasury \(baytul\-mal\) Othman said at a public assembly that, “The money which was in the treasury was sacred and belonged to Allah and that he \(as being the successor of the Prophet \[h\)\) had the right to dispose of them as he

thought fit\. He \(Othman\) threatened and cursed all those who presumed to censure or murmur at what he said\. Upon this, Ammar ibn Yasir boldly declared his disapprobation and began to charge him with his inveterate propensity to ignore the interests of the general public; accused him with reviving the heathenish customs abolished by the Prophet \(h\),

whereupon Othman ordereded him to be beaten\. Imediately some Umayyads, the relatives of the Caliph fell upon the venerable Ammar and the Caliph himself, kicking the lattedr with his shoes \(on his feet\) on Ammar’s testicles and afflicted him with a hernia\. Amma became unconscious for three days and was taken care of by Umm al\-Mu’minin \[mother of the Faithful\] Umm Salamah in her own house \( al \-Baladhiri, Ansab al\-Ashraf, Vol\. 5, pp\. 48, 54, 88; Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 3, pp\. 47\-52; Al\-Imamah wal\-Siyasa, Vol\. 1, pp\. 35\-36; Al\-\`Iqd al\-Farid, Vol\. 4, p\. 307; Al\-Tabaqat, Vol\. 3, Part 1, p\. 185; Tarikh al\-Khamis, Vol\. 2, p\. 271\)\.

<a id="page626"></a>When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) became Caliph, Ammar was

one of his most sincere supporters\. Ammar participated fully in all social, political and military activities during this period, especially in the first battle \(the Battle of Jamal\) and in the second \(the battle of Siffin\)\.

However, Ammar was martyred on the 9th of Safar, 37 A\.H\., in the battle of Siffin when he was over ninety years old\. On the day Ammar ibn Yasir achieved martyrdom, he turned his face to the sky and said the following:\.

“O Lord\! Surely You are aware that if I know that You wish that I should plunge myself into this River \(the Euphrates\) and be drowned, I will do it\. O Lord\! Surely You know that if I knew that You would be pleased if I put my scimitar on my chest \(to hit my heart\) and press it so hard that it comes out of my back, I would do it\. O Lord\! I do not think there is anything more pleasant to You than fighting this sinful group\. If I knew that any action at all is more pleasing to You, I would do it\.”

Abu Abd ar\-Rahman al\-Salami narrates the following:\.

“We were present with Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) at Siffin when I saw Ammar ibn Yasir not turning his face in any direction, or towards any valley of Siffin, but the companions of the Holy Prophet \(h\)

were following him as if he was a sign for them\. Then I heard Ammar say the following to Hashim ibn Utbah \(al \-Mirqal\): ‘O Hashim\! Rush into the enemy’s ranks, for Paradise is under the shade of the sword\! Today, I shall meet the beloved one, Muhammad \(h\) and his party\.’

“Then he said the following: ‘By Allah\! If they put us to fight \(and pursue us\) to the date\-palms of Hajar \(a town in Bahrain \[i\.e\. if they pursue us along all the Arabian desert\] nevertheless\) we know surely that we are right and they are wrong\.’

“Then he \(Ammar\) continued \(addressing the enemies\) thus: ‘We struck you so that you may \(believe in\) its \(Holy Quran\\s\) revelation; And today we strike you to \(believe in\) its interpretation; Such strike as to remove heads from their resting places; And to make the friend forget his sincere friend, until the truth returns to its \(right\)

course\.’”

The narrator says the following: “I did not see the Holy Prophet’s companions killed at any time as many as they were killed on that day\.”

<a id="page627"></a>Then Ammar spurred his horse, entered the battlefield and began fighting\. He persistently chased the enemy, launching one attack after another, raising challenging slogans till at last a group of mean\-spirited Syrians surrounded him from all sides\. A man named Abul\-Ghadiyah al\-Juhari \(al\- Fazari\) inflicted such a wound upon him that Ammar could not withstand it\. Ammar returned to his camp and asked for water\. A tumbler of milk was brought to him\. When Ammar looked at the tumbler, he said the following: “The Messenger of Allah had said the right thing\.” People asked him what he meant by those words\. He said, “The Messenger of Allah \(k\) informed me that my last sustenance in the life of this world

would be milk\.” Then he took that tumbler of milk in his hands, drank the milk and surrendered his life to Allah, the Almighty\. When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) came to know of his death, he came to Ammar’s side, put

his \(Ammar’s\) head on his own lap and recited the following elegy to mourn his death:

Surely any Muslim who is not distressed at the killing of the son of Yasir and is not afflicted by this grievous misfortune does not have a true faith\.

May Allah shower His mercy on Ammar the day he embraced Islam; may Allah shower His mercy on Ammar the day he was killed, and may Allah shower His mercy on Ammar the day he is raised to life\.

Certainly, I found Ammar \(on such level\) that three companions of the Holy Prophet \(h\) could not be named unless he was the fourth, and four of them could not be mentioned unless he was the fifth\.\.\.

There was none among the Holy Prophet’s companions who doubted this: Not only was Paradise once or twice bestowed upon Ammar, but that he gained his claim to it \(a number of times\)\. May Paradise give enjoyment to Ammar\.

Certainly, it was said \(by the Holy Prophet \[h\]\): “Surely,

Ammar is with the truth, and the truth is with Ammar; he turns wherever the truth turns; his killer will certainly be lodged in hell\.”

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) stepped forward and offered the

funeral prayers for Ammar and with his own hands he buried him with his clothes still on\.

<a id="page628"></a>Ammar’s death caused a good deal of commotion in the ranks of Mu\`awiyah, too, because there a large number of prominent people fighting on the side of Mu\`awiyah under the impression hat he was fighting Imam

Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) for a just cause\. These people were aware of the saying of the Holy Prophet \(h\) that Ammar would be killed by a

group that would be on the wrong track\. When they observed that Ammar had been killed by Mu\`awiyah’s army, they became convinced that they were on the wrong side and that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) was

definitely on the track\. This agitation thus caused among leaders as well as in the rank and file of Mu\`awiyah’s army was quelled by the latter with the argument that it was Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) who brought Ammar

to the battlefield and, therefore, it was he who was responsible for Ammar’s death\. When Mu\`awiyah’s argument was mentioned before Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), the Imam said that it was as if the Prophet

\(h\) was responsible for killing \[his brave uncle\] Hamzah since he

himself had brought him to the battlefield of Uhud\! \(al\-Tabari, Tarkh, Vol\. 1, pp\. 3316\-3322; Vol\. 3, pp\. 2314\-2319; Ibn Sa\`d, Al\- Tabaqat, Vol\. 3, Part 1, pp\. 176\-189; Ibn al\-Athir, Al\-Kamil, Vol\. 3, pp\. 308\-312; Ibn Kathir, Tarikh, Vol\. 7, pp\. 267\-272; al\-Minqari, Siffin, pp\. 320\-345; Ibn Abdul \-Barr, Al\-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 3, pp\. 1135\-1140; Vol\. 4, p\. 1725; Ibn al\-Athir, Usd al\-Ghaba, Vol\. 4, pp\. 43\-47; Vol\. 5, p\. 267; Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 5, pp\. 252\-258; Vol\. 8, pp\. 10\-28; Vol\. 10,

Abul\- Haytham \(Malik\) ibn at\-Tayyihan al\-Ansari was one of the twelve chiefs \(naqibs \[of the Ansar\] who attended the fair and met at al\-Aqabah the first and the second times\. It was there that he swore the pledge of allegiance to the Holy Prophet of Islam \(h\)\. He was present

also during the battle of Badr and in all other battles in addition to all places of assembly by the Muslims during the lifetime of the Holy Prophet \(h\)\. He was also among the sincere supporters of Imam Ali ibn

Abu Talib \(x\) on whose side he fought during the Battles of Jamal and of

Siffin where he was martyred \(Al\-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 4, p\. 1773; Siffin, p\. 365; Usd al\-Ghaba, Vol\. 4, p\. 274; Vol\. 5, p\. 318; Al\-Isaba, Vol\. 3, p\. 341;

<a id="page629"></a>Vol\. 4, pp\. 312 \-313; Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 10, pp\. 107\-108; Ansab al\-Ashraf, p\. 319\)\.

Khuzaymah ibn Thabit al\-Ansari \[who is referred to above\] is known as “Dhul\-Shahadatayn” \(the man with the two testimonials\) because the Holy Prophet \(h\) considered his testimony equivalent to that

of two witnesses\. He was present in the battle of Badr and in other battles as well as in the places of assembly of the Muslims during the lifetime of the Holy Prophet \(h\)\. He is counted among the earliest of those who

showed their adherence to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\. He was also

present in the Battles of Jamal and Siffin\. Abd ar\-Rahman ibn Abu Layla narrated that he saw a man in the battle of Siffin fighting the enemy valiantly, and when he protested against his action, the man said the following:\.

“I am Khuzaymah ibn Thabit al\-Ansari\. I have heard the Holy Prophet \(h\) saying, ‘Fight, fight, on the side of Ali’” \( orator al\-Baghdadi, Muwaddih Awham al\-Jam’ wal\-Tafriq, Vol\. 1, p\. 277\)\.

Khuzaymah was martyred in the battle of Siffn soon after the martyrdom of Ammar ibn Yasir\.

Sayf ibn \`Umar al\-Usaydi \(the well known liar\) has fabricated another Khuzaymah and claimed that the one who was martyred in the battle of Siffin was this one and not the one titled “Dhul\-Shahadatayn”\. Al\- Tabari has quoted this fabricated story from Sayf either intentionally or; otherwise, and through him this story has affected some other historians who quoted from or relied on al \-Tabari\. For further reference, see al\-‘Askari, Khamsun wa miah sahabi mukhtalaq \[one hundred and fifty fabricated companions\], Vol\. 2, pp\. 175\-189\.

After having rejected this fabrication, Ibn Abul\-Hadid adds \(in Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 10, pp\. 109\-110\) that: “Furthermore, what is the need for those who, in order to defend Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), boast of an abundance of statements by Khuzaymah, Abul\-Haytham, Ammar and others? If people treat this man \(Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \[x\]\)

with justice and look at him with healthy eyes, they will certainly realize that should he be alone \(on one side\) and all other people \(on the other side\) fighting him, he will still be on the side of the truth while all the rest will be wrong” \(Al\-Tabaqat, Vol\. 3, Part 1, pp\. 185, 188; Al\- Mustadrak, Vol\. 3, pp\. 385, 397; Usd al\-Ghaba, Vol\. 2, p\. 114; Vol\. 4, p\. 47; Al\-

<a id="page630"></a>Isti\`ab, Vol\. 2, p\. 448; al\-Tabari, Vol\. 3, pp\. 2316, 2319, 2401; Al\- Kamil, Vol\. 3, p\. 325; Siffin, pp\. 363, 398; Ansab al\-Ashraf, pp\. 313\-314\)\.

Among the people who were present during the Battle of Jamal on the side of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) were one hundred and thirty Badris \(those who participated in the battle of Badr with the Holy Prophet \[h\]\) and seven hundred of those who were present in the Pledge of ar\-

Ridwan \(Bay’at al\-Ridwan\) which took place under a tree \(al\-Dhahbi, Tarikh al\-Islam, Vol\. 2, p\. 171; Khalifah ibn Khayyat, Tarikh, Vol\. 1, p\. 164\)\. Those who were killed in the Battle of Jamal from among the supporters of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) numbered about five hundred

\(some said that the number of martyrs were more than that\)\. But on the side of the people of Jamal, twenty thousand were killed \(Al\-Iqd al\-Farid, Vol\. 4, p\. 326\)\.

Among those who were present in the Battle of Siffin on the side of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), there were eighty Badris and eight hundred of those who swore to the Holy Prophet \(h\) the Pledge of al\-

Ridwan \(Al\-Mustadrak, Vol\. 3, p\. 104; Al\-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 3, p\. 1138; Al\-Isaba, Vol\. 2, p\. 389; Tarkh, al\-Ya\`qubi, Vol\. 2, p\. 188\)\.

On the side of Mu\`awiyah, forty\-five thousand were killed, and on the sides of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), twenty\-five thousand\. Among these martyrs \(from the camp of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \[x\]\), there were

twenty\-five or twenty\-six Badris and sixty\-three or three hundred and three of the people of the Pledge of ar\-Ridwan \(Siffin, p\. 558; Al\-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 2, p\. 389; Ansab al\-Ashraf, p\. 322; Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 10, p\. 104; Abul\-Fida’, Vol\. 1, p\. 175; Ibn al\-Wardi, Tarkh, Vol\. 1, p\. 240; Ibn Kathr, Vol\. 7, p\. 275; Tarikh al\-Khams, Vol\. 2, p\. 277\)\.

Besides the distinguished and eminent companions of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), such as Ammar, “Dhul\-Shahadatayn” and Ibn al\-Tayyihan, those who were martyred in Siffin were:

i\. Hashim ibn \`Utbah ibn Abu Waqqas al\-Mirqal\. He was killed on the same day when Ammar was martyred\. He was the bearer of the standard of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s army on that day\.

1. Abdullah ibn Budayl ibn al\-Warqa al\-Khuza’i\. Sometimes, he was the right wing’s Commander of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s army and sometimes the infantry’s Commander\.
