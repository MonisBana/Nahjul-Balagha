**When after the Death of the Prophet \(h\) News Reached Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) about the Happening in Saqifa of Banu**

**Sa’i\-dah, He Inquired What the Ansar Said\. People Said That They Were Asking for One Chief from among Them and One from the Others, Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Said the Following:**

Why did you not argue against them \(Ansar\) that the Prophet \(h\)

had left his will that whoever is good among the Ansar should be treated well and whoever is bad should be forgiven\.

People said the following: “What is there against them in it?”

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said, “If the Government was for them there should have been no will in their favor\.”

Then he said the following: “What did the tribesmen of Quraish plead?” People answered: “They argued that they belong to the lineal tree of the Prophet \(h\)\.”

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said, “They argued with the tree but spoiled the fruits\.”

From what happened at the saqifa of Banu Sa’idah, it appears that the greatest argument of the Muhajirun against the Ansar and the basis of the former’s success was this very point that since they were the kith and

<a id="page442"></a>kin of the Prophet \(h\) no one else could deserve the Caliphate\. On this

very ground the big crowd of Ansar became ready to lay down their weapons before three Muhajirun and the latter succeeded in winning the Caliphate by presenting their distinction of descent\. Thus in connection with the events of saqifa al\-Tabari writes that when the Ansar assembled in the saqifa \(shed\) of Banu Sa\`idah to swear allegiance on the hand of Sa\`d ibn Abadah, somehow Abu Bakr, Umar and Abu Ubaydah ibn al\-Jarrah also got the hint and reached the re\. Umar had thought out something for this occasion and he rose to speak but Abu Bakr stopped him and he himself stood up\. After praising Allah and the migration of the Muhajirun and their precedence in Islam, he said the following: “They are those who worshipped Allah first of all and accepted belief in Allah and his Prophet’s friends and his kith and kin\. Therefore, these alone deserve the Caliphate themost\. Whoever clashes with them commits excess\.”

When Abu Bakr finished his speech, al\-Hubab ibn Mundhir stood up and, turning to the Ansar said the following: “O group of Ansar\! Do not give your reins in the hand of others\. The populace is under your care\. You are men of honor, wealth, tribe and gathering\. If the Muhajirun have precedence over you in some matters, you too have precedence over them in other matters\. You gave them refuge in your houses\. You are the fighting arm of Islam\. With your help Islam stood on its own feet\. In your cities the prayer of Allah was established with freedom\. Save yourselves from division and dispersion and stick to your right unitedly\. If the Muhajirun do not concede to your right tell them there should be one chief from us and one from them\.

No sooner had al\-Hubab sat down after saying this then Umar rose and spoke thus: “This cannot be\! There can be no two rulers at one and the same time\. By Allah\! The Arabs will never agree to have you as the head of the state since the Prophet \(h\) was not from among you\.

Certainly, the Arabs will not have the least objection in that the caliphate is allowed to one in whose house the Prophethood rests so that the ruler should also be from the same house\. For those who dissent, clear arguments can be put forth\. Whoever comes in conflict with us in the matter of the authority and rulership of Muhammad \(h\) he is leaning

towards wrong, is a sinner and is falling into destruction\.

After \`Umar, al\-Hubab again stood up and said to the Ansar, ALook, stick to your point and do not pay heed to the views of this man or his supporters\. They want to trample your rights\. If they do not consent

<a id="page443"></a>turn him and them out of your cities and appropriate the Caliphate\. Who other than you can deserve it more?

When al \-Hubab finished \`Umar scolded him\. There was a use of bad words from that side also and the status began to worsen\. On seeing this Abu Ubaydah ibn al\-Jarrah spoke with the intention of cooling down the Ansar and to win them over to his side and said the following:

“O Ansar\! You are the people who supported us and helped us in every manner\. Do not now change your ways and do not give up your behavior\.” But the Ansar refused to change their mind\. They were prepared to swear allegiance to Sa\`d and people just wanted to approach him when a man of Sa\`d’s tribe Bashr ibn \`Amr al\-Khazraji stood up and said the following: “No doubt we came forward for jihad and gave support to the religion, but our aim in doing thus was to please Allah and to obey His Prophet \(h\)\. It does not behoove us to claim superiority and

create trouble in the matter of the caliphate\. Muhammad \(h\) was from

Quraish and they have a greater right for it and are more appropriate for it\.”

As soon as Bashir uttered these words, dissension occurred among the Ansar, and this exactly was his aim because he could not see a man of his own tribe rising so high\. The Muhajirun took advantage of this division among the Ansar and Umar and Aba \`Ubaydah decided to swear allegiance to Abu Bakr\. They had just come forward when Bashir first of all put his hand on that of Abu Bakr and after that \`Umar and Abu Ubaydah swore the allegiance\. Then the people of Bashr’s tribe came and swore allegiance and trampled Sa\`d ibn Abadah under their feet\.

During this time Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) was occupied in the funeral bath and burial of the Prophet \(h\)\. When afterwards he heard

about the assembly at the saqifa and came to know that the Muhajirun had won the score over the Ansar by pleading themselves to be from the tribe of the Prophet \(h\), he uttered the fine sentence that those who argued on the lineal tree spoiled its fruits\. That is, if the Muhajirun’s claim was acceded for being from the lineal tree of the Prophet \(h\), how can those who are the fruits of this tree be ignored? It is strange that Abu Bakr who connects with the Prophet \(h\) in the seventh generation above and \`Umar who connects with him in theninth generation above may be held of the tribe and family of the Prophet \(h\) and he who was his first cousin is refused the status of a brother\.
