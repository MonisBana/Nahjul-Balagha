**Ali \(x\) Admonishing His Companions :**

for swearing allegiance\. Nevertheless, this allegiance was not on the count that they regarded his Caliphate as from Allah and him as an Imam \(The Divine Leader\) to obey as obligatory\. It was rather under their own principles which were known as democratic or consultative\. However, there was one group who was swearing allegiance to him as a religious obligation regarding his Caliphate as determined by Allah\. otherwise, the majority regarded him a ruler like the other Caliphs and as regarding precedence, on the fourth status, or at the level of the common men after the three caliphs\. Since the people, the army and the civil servants had been impressed by the beliefs and actions of the previous rulers and immersed in their ways whenever they found anything against their liking they fretted and frowned, evaded war and were ready to rise in disobedience and rebellion\. Furthermore, just as among those who fought in _jihad_ on the side of the Prophet \(h\), there were some seekers of this world and others of the Hereafter\.

Now, in the same way, there was no dearth of worldly men who were, in appearance, with Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) but actually they had connections with Mu\`awiyah who has promised some of them positions and had extended to others temptation of wealth\. To hold them as Sh\`as of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and to blame Shi\`ism for this reason is closing the eyes to facts because the beliefs of these people will be the same as of those who regarded Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) fourth in the series\. Ibn Abul\-Hadid throws light on the beliefs of these persons in clear words:

Whoever observes minutely the events during the period of Caliphate of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) will know that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had been

brought to bay because those who knew his real status were very few\. The swarming majority did not bear that belief about him which was obligatory to have\. They gave precedence to the previous Caliphs over him and held that the criterion of precedence was Caliphate\. In this matter, those coming later followed the predecessors and argued that if the predecessors had not the knowledge that the previous Caliphs had precedence over Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) they will

not have preferred them to him\. Rather, these people knew and took Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) as a citizen and subject\. Most of those who fought in his

company did so on grounds of prestige or Arab partisanship, not on the ground of religion or belief, as we read on p\. 72, Vol\. 1 of _Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha_\.

155In the atmosphere that had been created soon after the Prophet \(h\), Ahl al\-Bayt \(x\) \(members of his family\) had no course except to remain secluded

resulting in the world’s continued ignorance of their real qualities and being acquainted with their teachings and attainments\. To belittle them and keep them away from authority has been considered as the greatest service to Islam\. If

<a id="page493"></a>Othman’s open misdeeds had not given a chance to the Muslims to wake up and open their eyes there will have been no question of allegiance to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and temporal authority will have retained the same course as it had

so far followed\. But all those who could be named for the purpose had no courage to come forward because of their own shortcomings while Mu\`awiyah was sitting in his capital away from the center\. In these circumstances there was none except Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) who could be looked at\. Consequently

people’s eyes hovered around him and the same common people who, following the direction of the wind, had been swearing allegiance to others jumped at him for swearing allegiance\. Nevertheless, this allegiance was not on the count that they regarded his Caliphate as from Allah and him as an Imam \(The Divine Leader\) to obey as obligatory\. It was rather under their own principles which were known as democratic or consultative\.

<a id="page494"></a>Although Allah gives a respite to the oppressor, His might does not spare him\. Allah takes hold of him on the passage of his way and the status of that which suffocates the throats\.

By Allah in Whose power my life lies\! These people \(Mu\`awiyah and his men\) will overcome you not because they have a better right than you but because of their hastening towards the wrong with their leader and your slowness about my right \(to be followed\)\. People are afraid of the oppression of their rulers while I fear the oppression of my subjects\.

I called you forward but you did not come\. I warned you but you did not listen\. I called you secretly as well as openly, but you did not respond\. I gave you sincere counsel, but you did not accept it\. Are you present like the absent and slaves like masters? I recite before you points of wisdom but you turn away from them and I admonish you with far reaching advice but you disperse away from it\. I rouse you for jihad against the people of rebellion but before I come to the end of my speech, I see you disperse like the sons of Saba\.156 You return to your places and deceive one another by your counsel\. I straighten you in the morning but you are back to me in the evening as curved as the back of a bow\. The one who straightens has become weary while those to be straightened have become incorrigible\.

O those whose bodies are present but wits are absent and whose wishes are scattered and their rulers are on trial\. Your leader obeys Allah but you disobeyed him while the leader of the people of Syria disobeys Allah but they obey him\. By Allah, I wish Mu\`awiyah will exchange with me dinars for dirhams, so that he gives from me ten of you and gives me one from them\.

people of Kufa\! I have experienced in you three things and two others: you are deaf in spite of having ears, dumb in spite of speaking and blind in spite of having eyes\. You are neither true supporters in combat nor dependable brothers in distress\. Your hands may be soiled with earth\. O examples of those camels whose herdsman has disappeared, if they are

156The progeny of Saba’ ibn Yashjub ibn Ya\`rub ibn Qahtan is known as the tribe of Saba’ \[in English, Sheba\]\. When these people began to falsify prophets, to shake them, Allah sent a flood of water by which their gardens were submerged and they left their houses and property to settle down in different cities\. This proverb arose out of this event and it is now applied wherever people so disperse that there be no hope of their joining together again\.

<a id="page495"></a>collected together from one side they disperse from the other\. By Allah, I see you in my imagination that if war becomes intense and action is in full swing you will run away from the son of Abu Talib like the woman who becomes naked in the front\. I am certainly on clear guidance from my Master \(Allah\) and on the path of my Prophet \(h\) and I am on the right

path which I adhere to regularly\.

**About the Household of the Holy Prophet \(h\):**

Behold the people of the Prophet’s family\! Adhere to their direction\. Follow their footsteps because they will never let you out of guidance and never throw you into destruction\. If they sit down, you sit down and if they rise up you rise up\. Do not go ahead of them, as you will thereby go astray and do not lag behind them as you will thereby be ruined\.

I have seen the companions of the Prophet \(h\) but I do not find

anyone resembling them\. They began the day with dust on the hair and face \(in hardship of life\) and passed the night in prostration and standing in prayers\. Sometimes they put down their foreheads and sometimes their cheeks\. With the recollection of their resurrection it seemed as though they stood on live coals\. It seemed that in between their eyes there were signs like knees of goats, resulting from long prostrations\. When Allah was mentioned their eyes flowed freely till their shirt collars were drenched\. They trembled for fear of punishment and hope of reward as the tree trembles on the day of stormy wind\.
