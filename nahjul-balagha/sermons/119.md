**About The Greatness Of Ahl Al\-Bayt \(x\) And The Importance Of The Laws Of Islam :**

By Allah\! I have knowledge of the conveyance of messages, fulfillment of promises and of entire expressions\. We the people of the house \(Ahl al\-Bayt \[x\]\) possess the doors of wisdom and light of

governance\. Beware that the paths of religion are one and its highways are straight\. He who follows them achieves \(the aim\) and secures \(the objective\)\. And he who stood away from it went astray and incurred repentance\.

Do act for the day for which provisions are stored and when the intentions will be tested\. If a personâ€™s own intelligence which is present with him does not help him, the wits \(of others\) which are remote from him are more unhelpful and those which are away from him more useless\. Dread the fire whose flame is severe, whose hollow is deep, whose outfit is iron and whose drink is bloody puss\. Beware\! The good name of a man161 retained by Allah, the Sublime, among the people is better than wealth inherited by those who will not praise him\.

A Persian couplet says the following:

Happy is he who is remembered well after himself, For nothing, save the name, remains after the man is dead\.

161If a person gives away something in his life\-time then the recipient feels obliged to him\. But if wealth is extracted by force then the extractor does not feel himself under his obligation, nor does he praise it\. The same is the case of one who dies\. His successors think that whatever he had left behind was their right and they should have received it\. In this there is no obligation of his to be acknowledged\. But if he had done some good act with this very wealth his name will have remained behind him and people will have praised him also\.
