**Sermon 168**

**When the people of Jamal set out for Basra, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said the following :**\.

There is no doubt that Allah sent down the Prophet \(h\) as a

guide with an eloquent Book and a standing command\. No one will be ruined by it except one who ruins his own self\. Certainly, only doubtful innovations cause ruin except those from which Allah may protect you\. In Allahâ€™s authority lies the safety of your affairs\. Therefore, render Him such obedience as is neither blameworthy nor insincere\. By Allah, you must do so; otherwise, Allah will take away from you the power of Islam and will never thereafter return it to you till it reverts to others\.

Certainly, these people are in agreement in disliking my authority\. I will carry on till I perceive disunity among you because if they succeed in spite of the unsoundness of their view, the whole organization of the Muslims will be shattered\. They are hankering after this world out of jealousy against him on whom Allah has bestowed it\. So they intend to revert the matters on their backs \(return to the pre \-Islamic period\), while on us it is obligatory, for your sake, to abide by the Book of Allah \(Holy Quran\), the Sublime and the conduct of the Prophet of Allah \(k\), to stand by His rights and to revive his Sunnah\.
