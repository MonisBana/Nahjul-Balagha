**Sermon 239**

**Exhorting His Men to Carry out Jihad, Asking Them to Refrain from Seeking a Life of Luxury**

Allah admonishes you to thank Him and assigns to you His affairs\. He has allowed time in the limited field \(of life\) so that you may vie with each other in seeking the reward \(of Paradise\) \. Therefore, tighten your belts and wrap up the hems\. High courage and dinners do not go together\. Sleep causes weakness in the big affairs of the day and \(its\) darkness obliterates the thoughts of courage\.
