**Exhorting People for Jihad**

Now then, surely Jihad is one of the doors to Paradise, which Allah has opened for His chief friends\. It is the outfit of piety and the protective armor of Allah and His trustworthy shield\. Whoever abandons it Allah covers him with the outfit of disgrace and the clothe s of distress\. He is kicked with contempt and scorn and his heart is veiled with screens \(of neglect\)\. Truth is taken away from him because of missing jihad\. He has to suffer ignominy and justice is denied to him\.

Beware\! I called you \(insistently\) to fight these people night and day, secretly and openly and exhorted you to attack them before they attacked you because by Allah, no people have been attacked in the hearts of their houses but they suffered disgrace\. But you put it off for others and forsook it till destruction befell you and your cities were occupied\. The horsemen of Banu Ghamid 1 have reached al\-Anbar and killed Hassan ibn Hassan al\-Bakri\. They have removed your horsemen from the garrison\.

I have come to know that everyone of them entered upon Muslim women and other women under the protection of Islam and took away their ornaments from their legs, arms, necks and ears\. No woman could resist it except by pronouncing the verse, AWe are from Allah and to Him we shall return\. \(Holy Quran, 2: 156\) Then they returned, laden with wealth, without any wound or loss of life\. If any Muslim dies of grief after all this he is not to be blamed but rather there is justification for him before me\.

How strange\! How strange\! By Allah\! My heart sinks to see the unity of these people in their wrong \-doings and your dispersion from the right\. May woe and grief befall you\. You have become the target at which arrows are shot\. You are being killed and you do not kill\. You are being attacked but you do not attack\. Allah is being disobeyed and you remain agreeable to it\. When I ask you to move against them in the summer you say it is hot weather, spare us until the heat subsides from us\. When I order you to march in winter you say it is severely cold; give us time until the cold clears from us\. These are just excuses of evading heat or cold

Egypt, and by whatever means possible, he would not let Mu\`awiyah’s authority in Syria endure\. Consequently, both of them fulfilled the agreement and kept their words\.

<a id="page397"></a>because if you run away from heat and cold, you would be, by Allah, running away \(in a greater degree\) from the sword \(war\)\.

O you semblance of men, not men, your intelligence is that of children and your wit is that of the occupants of the curtained canopies \(women kept in seclusion from the outside world\)\. I wish I had not seen you nor known you\. By Allah, this acquaintance has brought about shame and resulted in repentance\. May Allah fight you\! You have filled my heart with puss and loaded my bosom with rage\. You made me drink mouthful after mouthful of grief\. You shattered my counsel by disobeying and leaving me so much so that Quraish started saying that the son of Abu Talib is brave but does not know \(tactics of\) war\. Allah bless them\! Is any one of them more fierce in war and more older in it than I am? I rose for it although yet within my twenties and here I am, have crossed over sixty, but one who is not obeyed can have no opinion\.

After the battle of Siffin, Mu\`awiyah had spread killing and bloodshed all around and started encroachments on cities within Amir al\-Mu’minin’s domain\. In this connection he duped Sufyan ibn Awf al\-Ghamidi with a force of six thousand to attack Hit, al\-Anbar and al\-Mada’in\. First he reached al \-Mada’in but finding it deserted proceeded to al\-Anbar\. Here a contingent of five hundred soldiers was posted as guard from Amir al\-Mu’minin’s side, but it could not resist the fierce army of Mu\`awiyah\. Only a hundred men stuck to their status and they faced them as stoutly as they could\. But, collecting together, the enemy’s force made such a severe attack that they too could no more resist and the chief of the contingent, Hassan ibn Hassan al\-Bakri was killed along with thirty others\. When the battlefield was clear the enemy ransacked al\-Anbar with total freedom and left the city completely destroyed\.

When Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) got the news of this attack, he

ascended the pulpit and exhorted the people for crushing the enemy and called them to jihad\. Yet, from no quarter was there any voice or response\. He alighted from the pulpit utterly disgusted and worried and in the same condition set off for the enemy on foot\. When people observed this their sense of self\-respect and shame was also awakened and they too followed him\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) stopped at an\-Nukhayla\. People then

surrounded him and insisted that he return as they had enough to face the enemy\. When their insistence increased beyond reckoning, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) consented to return and Sa’id ibn Qays al\-Hamdani

proceeded forward with a force of eight thousand\. But Sufyan ibn Awf al\-Ghamidi had gone, so Sa’id came back without any encounter\. When

<a id="page398"></a>Sa’id reached Kufa then \- according to the version of Ibn Abu’ Hadid \- Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) was so deeply grieved and indisposed during those

days to an extent of not wishing to enter the mosque\. He instead sat in the corridor of his residence \(that connects the entrance of the mosque\) and wrote this sermon for the people but gave it to his slave Sa\`d to read for them\. But al\-Mubarrad \(Al\-Kamil, Vol\. 1, pp\. 104\-107\) has related from \`Ubaydullah ibn Hafs al\-Taymi, Ibn Aisha, that Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)

delivered this sermon on a high place in an\-Nukhayla\. Ibn Maytham has held this as a preferable view\.
