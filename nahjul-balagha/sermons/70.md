**Condemning the Then People of Iraq:**

Ow, then, O folks\!144

144When after arbitration the Iraqis displayed lethargy and heartlessness in retaliating against the continuous attacks of Mu\`awiyah, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) delivered this sermon scorning and admonishing them\. Herein he has referred to

their being deceived at SiffÂ‰n and has likened them to a woman who has five qualities:

1. Firstly, she is pregnant\. This implies that these people had full capability to fight and were not like a barren woman from whom nothing is expected\.
2. Secondly, she has completed the period of pregnancy\. That is they had passed over all difficult stages and has approached near the final goal of Victory\.
3. Thirdly, she willfully miscarries her child\. That is after coming close to victory they came down to settlement and instead of achieving the coveted goal faced disappointment\.

Iv \) Fourthly, her period of widowhood is long\. That is they fell in such a state as though they had no protector or patron and they were roaming about without any ruler\.

1. Fifthly, her successors would be distant persons\. That is the people of Syria who had no relationship with them would occupy their properties\.

<a id="page447"></a>You are like the pregnant woman who, on completion of the period of pregnancy delivers a dead child and her husband is also dead and her period of widowhood is long while only remote relationship inherits her\. By Allah, I did not come to you of my own accord\. I came to you by force of circumstances\. I have come to know that you say Ali speaks lies\. May Allah fight you\! Against whom do I speak lies? Against Allah? But I am the first to have believed in Him\. Against His Prophet \(h\) ? But I am the first who testified to him\. Certainly not\. By Allah it

was a way of expression which failed to appreciate and you were not capable of it\. Woe unto you\. I am giving out these measures of nice expression free of any cost\. I wish there were vessels good enough to hold them\.

Certainly, you will understand it after some time\. \(Holy Quran,

38: 88\)
