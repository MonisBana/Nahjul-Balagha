**About Those Who Found Pretexts at the Time of Jihad**

O people\! Your bodies are together but your desires are divergent\. Your talk softens the hard stones and your action attracts your enemy towards you\. You claim in your sittings that you would do this and that, but when fighting approaches, you say \(to war\), “turn away” \(i\.e\. flee away\)\. If one calls you \(for help\), the call receives no heed\. And he

<a id="page400"></a>who deals harshly with you his heart has no solace\. The excuses are amiss like that of a debtor unwilling to pay\. The ignoble cannot ward off oppression\. Right cannot be achieved without effort\. Which is the house besides this one to protect? And with which leader \(Imam\) would you go for fighting after me?

By Allah\! deceived is one whom you have deceived while, by Allah, he who is successful with you receives only useless arrows\! You are like broken arrows thrown over the enemy\. By Allah\! I am now in the status that I neither confirm your views nor hope for your support, nor challenge the enemy through you\. What is the matter with you? What is your ailment? What is your cure? the other party is also men of your shape \(but they are so different in character\)\. Will there be talk without action, carelessness without piety and greed in things not right?131
