**Sermon 116**

**Rebuking Misers :**

You spend no wealth in the cause of the One Who gave it to you, nor do you risk your lives for the sake of the One Who created such lives\. You enjoy honor through Allah among His creatures, but you do not honor Allah among His creatures\. You should derive lessons from occupying the places of those who were before you and from the departure of your nearest brothers\.
