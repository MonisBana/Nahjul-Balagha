**Delivered when the Holy Prophet \(h\) died and Abbas ibn Abdul\-Muttalib and Abu Sufyan ibn Harb offered to swear allegiance to Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) as the Caliph**

O People\!119

Steer clear through the waves of mischief by boats of deliverance, turn away from the path of dissension and put off the gowns of pride\. Prosperous is one who rises with wings \(i\.e\. when he has power\) or else he remains peaceful and others enjoy ease\. It \(i\.e\. The aspiration for Caliphate\) is like turbid water or like a morsel that would suffocate the

119When the Holy Prophet \(h\) died, Abu Sufyan was not in Medina\. He

was coming back when on his way he got the news of this tragedy\. At once, he inquired who had become the leader the chief\. He was told that people had paid allegiance to Abu Bakr\. On hearing this, the acknowledged mischief\-monger of Arabia went into deep thought and eventually went to Abbas ibn Abdul\-Muttalib with a proposal\. He said to him, “Look\! These people have by contrivance handed over the Caliphate to the Taym and deprived Banu Hashim of it for good\. And, after himself, this man will place over our heads a haughty man from Banu Adiy\. Let us go to Ali bin Abu Talib \(x\) and ask him to get out of his house and take arms

to secure his right\.” So, taking Abbas with him, he went to Ali \(x\) and said: “Give

me your hand\. I pledge allegiance to you, and if anyone rises in opposition, I will fill the streets of Medina with men of cavalry and infantry\.” This was the most delicate moment for Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)\. He regarded himself as the true master

and successor of the Prophet \(h\), while a man with the backing of a tribe such as

that of Abu Sufyan was ready to support him\. Just a signal was enough to ignite the flames of war\. But Amir al\-Mu’minin’s foresight and right judgment saved the Muslims from civil war as his piercing eyes perceived that this man wanted to start a civil war by rousing the passions of tribal partisanship and distinction of birth so that Islam would be struck with a convulsion that would shake it to its roots\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\), therefore, rejected his counsel and admonished him several and

spoke forth the words, whereby he had stopped people form mischief\-mongering and undue conceit\. He declared his stand to be, for him, there were only two coursesCeither take up arms or sit quietly at home\. If he rose for war, there were no supporters so that he could suppress the rising insurgence\. The only course left was to quietly wait for the opportunity until circumstances were favorable\.

<a id="page359"></a>person who swallows it\. One who plucks fruits before ripening is like one who cultivated in another’s field\.

If I speak out they would call me greedy towards power, but if I keep quiet they would say I was afraid of death\. It is a pity that after all the ups and downs \(I have been through\)\. By Allah, the son of Abu Talib120 is more familiar with death than an infant with the breast of its mother\. I have hidden knowledge; if I disclose it you will start trembling like ropes in deep wells\.

Amir al\-Mu’minin’s calm at this stage was indicative of his high policy and far\-sightedness because if in those circumstances Medina had become the center of war, its fire would have engulfed the whole of Arabia in its flames\. The discord and scuffle that had already begun among the Muhajirun and the ansar would have increased to maximum, the wire\-pulling of the hypocrites would have had full play and Islam’s ship would have been caught in such a whirlpool that its balancing would have been difficult\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) suffered trouble and

tribulations, but did not raise his hands\. History is witness that during his life at Mecca, the Prophet \(h\) suffered all sorts of troubles but he was not

prepared to clash or struggle by abandoning patience and endurance because he realized that if war took place at that stage the way for Islam’s growth and fruition would be closed\. Of course, when he had collected supporters and helpers enough to suppress the flood of unbelief and curb

120About the death, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) says that it is so dear to him that

even an infant does not so love to leap towards the source of its nourishment while in its mother’s lap\. An infant’s attachment with the breast of its mother is under the effect of a natural impulse, but the dictates of natural impulses change with the advance of age\. When the limited period of infancy ends and the infant’s temperament changes, he does not like to even look at what was so familiar to him but rather turns his face from it in disgust\. But, the love of prophets and saints for union with Allah is mental and spiritual and mental and spiritual feelings do not change, nor does weakness or decay occur in them\. Since death is the means and first rung toward this goal, their love for death increases to such an extent that its rigors become the cause of pleasure for them and its bitterness proves to be the source of delight for their taste\. Their love for it is the same as that of the thirsty for the well or that of a lost passenger for his goal\. Thus, when Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)

was wounded by Abd ar\-Rahman ibn Muljim’s fatal attack, he said, “I was but like the walker who has reached \(the goal\) or like the seeker who has found \(his object\) and whatever is with Allah is good for the pious\. The Prophet \(h\) also said that there is no pleasure for a believer other than union with Allah\.

<a id="page360"></a>the disturbances, he rose to face the enemy\. Similarly, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\), treating the life of the Prophet \(h\) as a torch for his guidance,

refrained from exhibiting the power of his arm because he was realizing that rising against the enemy without helpers and supporter would become a source of rebellion and defeat instead of success and victory\. Therefore, on this occasion, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) has likened the desire for

Caliphate to turbid water or a morsel suffocating the throat\. Thus, even where people had forcibly snatched this morsel and wanted to swallow it by forcible thrusting, it got stuck in their throat\. They could neither swallow it nor vomit it out\. That is, they could neither manage it as is apparent from the blunders they committed in connection with Islamic injunctions, nor were they ready to cast off the knot from their neck\.

He reiterated the same ideas in different words thus; “Had I attempted to pluck the unripe fruit of Caliphate, then by this the orchard would have been desolated and I, too, would have achieved nothing, like these people who cultivate on other’s land but can neither guard it, nor water it at the proper time, nor reap any crop from it\. The status of these people is that if I ask them to vacate it so that the owner should cultivate it himself and protect it, they say how greedy I am, while if I keep quiet they think I am afraid of death\. They should tell me on what occasion did I ever feel afraid, or flew from a battlefield for my life, whereas every small or big encounter is proof of my bravery and a witness to may daring and courage\. He who plays with swords and strikes against hillocks is not afraid of death\. I am so familiar with death that even an infant is not so familiar with the breast of its mother\. Hark\! The reason for my silence is the knowledge that the Prophet \(h\) has put in my bosom\. If I divulge it

you would get perplexed and bewildered\. Let some days pass and you would know the reason of my inaction and perceive with your own eyes what sort of people would appear on this scene under the name of Islam and what destruction they would bring about\. My silence is because this would happen, otherwise, it is not silence without reason\.”

A Persian axiom says the following: “Silence has a meaning which cannot be couched in words\.”
