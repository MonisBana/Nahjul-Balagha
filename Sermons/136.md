**About Talhah and az\-Zubayr**

By Allah, they did not find any disagreeable thing in me, nor did they do justice between me and themselves\. Surely, they are now demanding a right which they have abandoned and blood which they have themselves shed\. If I partook in it with them then they too have a share in it, but if they committed it without me the demand should be against them\. The first step of their justice should be that they pass verdict against themselves\. I have my intelligence with me\.

I have never mixed matters nor have they appeared mixed to me\. Certainly, this is the rebellious group in which there is thenear one \(az\-Zubayr\), the scorpion’s venom \(Aisha\) and doubts which cast a veil \(on facts\)\. But the matter is clear and the wrong has been shaken from its foundation\. Its tongue has stopped uttering mischief\. By Allah, I will prepare for them a cistern from which I alone will draw water\. They will not be able to drink from it nor will they be able to drink from any other place\.

165Here Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) points to the view of Umar bin al\-

Khattab which he had on the allegiance of Abu Bakr on the day of _saqifa_ when he said the following: “Let me clarify this to you that the allegiance with Abu Bakr was a mistake and without thinking \(_falta_\) but Allah saved us from its evil\. Therefore, whoever \(intends to\) act like this you must kill him” \(_Sahih al\-Bukhari_, Vol\. 8, p\.211;_ As\-Sira an\-Nabawiyya_, Ibn Hisham, Vol\. 4, pp\. 308\-309;_ Tarikh al\-Tabari_, Vol\. 1, p\.1822;_ Al\-Kamil_, Ibn Al\-Athir Vol\. 2, p\.327;_ Tarikh ibn Kathir_, Vol\. 5, pp\.245\-246;* Al\-Musnad *of Imam Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Vol\. 1,

1. 255; _Al\-Sira al\-Halabiyya_, Vol\. 3, pp\. 388, 392; _Al\-Ansab_ by al\- Baladhiri, Vol\. 5, p\. 15; _Al\-Tamhid_ by al\-Baqillani, p\. 196; _Sharh ibn Abul\-Hadid_, Vol\. 2, p\. 23\)\.

<a id="page551"></a>**Part of the same sermon:**

You advanced towards me shouting allegiance, allegiance like she\-camels having delivered newly born young ones leaping towards their young\. I held back my hand but you pulled it towards you\. I drew back my hand but you dragged it\. O Lord\! These two have ignored my rights and did injustice to me\. They both have broken allegiance to me and roused people against me\. Unfasten You what they have fastened and do not make strong what they have woven\. Show them the evil in what they aimed at and acted upon\. Before fighting I asked them to be steadfast in allegiance and behaved with them with consideration but they belittled the blessing and refused \(to adopt the course of safety\)\.
