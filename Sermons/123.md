**Sermon 123**

**Exhorting His Followers to Fight :**

Put the armored man forward and keep the unarmored one behind\. Grit your teeth because this will make the swords skip off the skull and dodge on the sides of the spears for it changes the direction of their blades\. Close the eyes because it strengthens the spirit and gives peace to the heart\. Kill the voices because this will keep off spiritlessness\.

Do not let your banner bend, nor leave it alone\. Do not give it to anyone except the brave and the defenders of honor among you because they alone endure the befalling of troubles; they surround the banners and encircle them on both sides, their rear and their front\. They do not separate from them lest they give them \(to the enemy\)\. They do not go ahead of them lest they leave them alone\. Everyone should deal with his adversary and also help his comrade by his own life and should not leave the adversary to his comrade lest both his own adversary and his comrade join against him\.

By Allah\! Even if you run away from the sword of today you will not remain safe from the sword of the next world\. You are the foremost among the Arabs and great figures\. Certainly in running away there is the wrath of Allah, unceasing disgrace and lasting shame\. And certainly run

<a id="page525"></a>who runs does not lengthen his life, nor does anything come to intervene between him and his day \(of death\)\. Who is there to go towards Allah like the thirsty going to the water? Paradise lies under the edges of spears\. Today the reputations \(about the valor of warriors\) will be tested\.

By Allah\! I am more eager to meet them \(in combat\) than they are for \(returning to\) their houses\. O Lord\! If they reject truth, disperse their group, divide their words \(opinion\) and destroy them on account of their sins\.

They will not budge from their stand till the continuous striking of spears causes piercing \(of wounds\) through which wind may pass\. And the hitting of swords cuts through the skull, cleaves bones and breaks forearms and legs, till they are attacked by contingent after contingent and assaulted by detachments which are followed by reserves for support, till their cities are continuously assailed by force after force and till the horses trample even the extreme ends of the lands, the tracks of their beast and their meadows\.

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “Add\-da’q means trampling, e\.g\. ataduqqul\-khuyulu bihawafiriha ardahum \(the horses trample the ground with their hoofs\)\. Anawahini ardihim means lands opposite each other\. It is said, amanazilu bani fulanin tatanaharu, meaning: The houses of so\-and\-so face each other\.

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) delivered this sermon on the occasion of the battle of Siffin\. This battle was fought in the year 37 A\.H\. between Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and the governor of Syria,

Mu\`awiyah, for the so\-called avenging for the killing of Caliph Othman\. But in reality it was nothing more than Mu\`awiyah who had been the autonomous governor of Syria from Caliph Omer’s days\. He, not wanting to lose that status by swearing allegiance to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

but wanting to keep his authority intact by exploiting the killing of Caliph Othman, for later events, proved, that after securing the government, he did not take any practical step to avenge Othman’s blood\. And he never spoke, not even through omission, about the killers of \`Othman\.

Although from the first day Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) realized

that was inevitable, it was still necessary to exhaust all pleas\., therefore, Monday the 12th Rajab, 36 A\.H\. he returned to Kufa after the Battle of Jamal\. He sent Jarir ibn Abdillah al\- Bajali with a letter to Mu\`awiyah at Damascus wherein he wrote that the Muhajirun and the Ansar had sworn

<a id="page526"></a>allegiance to him and that he too should first swear him allegiance and thereafter place the case of Othman’s killing before him so that he could pass verdict the reon according to the Holy Quran and Sunnah\. But Mu\`awiyah detained Jarir on several pretexts and after consulting Amr ibn al\-As, staged a rebellion on the excuse of Othman’s killing\. And with the help of important persons of Syria, he convinced the ignorant people that the liability for Othman’s life lay on Ali \(x\) and that he, with his

conduct, had encouraged the besiegers and had given them protection\. Meanwhile he hung the blood\-stained shirt of Othman and the amputated fingers of his wife Na’ila daughter of al\-Farafisah on the pulpit in the Central Mosque of Damascus around which seventy thousand Syrians cried and swore the pledge to avenge Othman’s blood\. When Mu\`awiyah had roused the feelings of the Syrians to such an extent that they were determined to lay down their lives and be killed, he secured their allegiance on the cause of avenging Othman’s blood and busied himself in equipping for the battle\. Thereafter, he showed all this to Jarr then sent him back mortified\.

When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) learned of these matters

through Jarir ibn Abdillah al \-Bajali, he was forced to rise against Mu\`awiyah, ordering Malik ibn Habib al\-Yarbu’i to mobilize their forces in the valley of An\-Nukhayla\. Consequently, people from the suburbs of Kufa began arriving there in large numbers, till they exceeded eighty thousand\. First of all, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) sent a vanguard

contingent, eight thousand strong, under Ziyad ibn an\-Nadr al\-Harithi and another of four thousand strong under Shurayh ibn Hani al \-Harithi towards Syria\. After the departure of this vanguard contingent he himself set out for Syria at the head of the remaining army on Wednesday the 5th of Shawwal\. When he was out of the boundary of Kufa he offered zuhr \(noon\) prayer and after staying at Dayr Abu Musa, Nahr \(river\) Nars, Quba’t Qubbin, Babil \(Babylon\), Dayr Ka\`b, Kerbala’, Sabat, Bahurasini, al\-Anbar and Jazira arrived at ar\-Riqqa\. The people of this place were in favor of Othman and at this very place Simak ibn Makhtamah al\-Asadi was putting up eight hundred men\. These people had left Kufa to join Mu\`awiyah after deserting Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\. When they had

seen Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s force, they had dismantled the bridge over the River Euphrates so that the Imam’s army should not cross over to the other side of the river\. But at the threatening of Malik ibn al\-Harith al\-Ashtar an\- Nakh\`i they were frightened\. After consultations among themselves they put the bridge together again and Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) passed over it with his army\. When he alighted on the other side

of the river he saw that Ziyad and Shurayh were also camped there along

<a id="page527"></a>with their men since both of them had adopted the land route\. When, on reaching here, they found that Mu\`awiyah was advancing with his armies towards the Euphrates and thinking that they will not be able to face him, they stopped there waiting for Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\. When they

had given the reason for their stopping the re, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

accepted their plea and sent them forward\. When they reached surat ar\-Rum they found that Abul\-Awar al\-Salami was camping there with his army\. Both of them informed Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) of this,

whereupon he despatched Malik ibn al\-Harith al\-Ashtar an\-Nakhi in their wake as the Officer in Command, cautioning him not to initiate the fighting but to try to counsel them and appraise them of the correct status as far as possible\. In this way, on reaching there Malik al\-Ashtar encamped a little distance away\. Fighting could have commenced any moment, but he did not interfere with the other side nor did he take any step by which fighting could have been commenced\. But Abul\-A\`war suddenly attacked them at night, whereupon they took their swords out of the sheaths and prepared to repulse them\. Clashes between the two sides went on for sometime but in the end, taking benefit of the darkness of night Abul\-A\`war fled away\. Since fighting had already commenced, soon after the appearance of dawn an Iraqi commander, Hashim ibn \`Utbah al\-Mirqal az\-Zuhri, took his status in the battlefield\. From the other side also a contingent came to face him and the flames of fighting rose\. At last Malik al\-Ashtar challenged Abul\-Awar to fight him, but he did not dare to face him and towards the evening Malik al\-Ashtar went onward with his men\. The next day Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) reached

there with his force and set off for Siffin with the vanguard contingent and other forces\. Mu\`awiyah had already reached there and had set up his bases\. He had also placed a guard on the Euphrates and had occupied it\. On reaching there Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) sent him word to remove

the guard from Euphrates, but he refused, whereupon theiraqis took out their swords and in a courageous attack captured the Euphrates\. When this stage was over Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) sent Bashir ibn Amr al\-

Ansari, Sa’id ibn Qays al\-Hamdani and Shabath ibn Rab\`i at\- Tamimi to Mu\`awiyah to apprise him of the consequences of war and to make him agree to settlement and allegiance\. But his relay was that they could not by any means let Othman’s blood remain neglected and that now the sword alone will arbitrate between them\. Consequently in the month of Dhul \-Hijja 36 A\.H\. both the parties decided on war and warriors from each side came out into the field to face their adversary\. Those who entered the battlefield from Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s side were: Hijr ibn Adiy al\-Kindi, Shabath ibn Rab\`i at\-Tamimi, Khalid ibn al\-Mu’ammar,

<a id="page528"></a>Ziyad ibn an\-Nadr al\-Harithi, Ziyad ibn Khasafah at\-Taymi, Sa’id ibn Qays al\-Hamdani, Qays ibn Sa\`d al\-Ansari and Malik ibn al\-Harith al\-Ashtar an\-Nakh\`i while from the Syrians there were, \`Abd ar\- Rahman ibn Khalid ibn al\-Walid al\-Makhzumi, Abul\-Awar al\-Salami, Habib ibn Maslamah al\- Fihri, \`Abdullah ibn Dhi’l\-Kala’al\-Himyari, \`Ubaydullah ibn Umar ibn al\-Khattab, Shurahbil ibn Simt al\-Kindi and Hamzah ibn Malik al\-Hamdani\. When the month of Dhul\- Hijja came to end the fighting had to be stopped for Muharram, but from the 1st of Safar fighting was resumed and both parties arrayed themselves opposite each other, equipped with swords, spears and other weapons\. On Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s side Malik al\-Ashtar was in command of the horsemen and Ammar ibn Yasir of the foot soldiers of Kufa while Sahl ibn Hanayf al\-Ansari was in command of the horsemen and Qays ibn Sa\`d of the foot soldiers of Basra\. The banner of the army was given to Hashim ibn Utbah\. In the army of the Syrians on the right hand contingent ibn Dhi’l\-Kala’ was in command, while on the left hand contingent Habb ibn Maslamah, on horsemen Amr ibn al\-As and on foot soldiers ad\-Dahhak ibn Qays al\-Fihri were in command\.

On the first day Malik ibn al\-Ashtar entered the battlefield with his men and from the other side Habib ibn Maslamah came out with his men to face him and from both sides a fierce battle ensued\. Throughout the day swords clashed with swords and spears with spears\.

The next day, Hashim ibn Utbah came out with Ali’s army and from the other side Abul\-A\`war with his footmen came to face him\. When the two armies approached each other, horsemen fell upon horsemen and footmen upon footmen and continued attacking each other and they endured with great patience and steadfastness\.

On the third day, Ammar ibn Yasir and Ziyad ibn an\-Nadr came out with horsemen and foot soldiers and from the other side \`Amr ibn al\-As came forward with a big force\. Ziyad attacked the horsemen of the opposite side and Malik al\-Ashtar attacked the foot soldiers so furiously that the enemy’s men lost ground and, failing to offer resistance, returned to their camps\.

On the fourth day Muhammad ibn al\-Hanafiyya appeared on the battlefield with his men\. From the other side \`Ubaydullah ibn \`Umar came forward with the Syrian army and both the armies had a serious encounter\.

<a id="page529"></a>On the fifth day, Abdullah ibn Abbas came forward and from the other side al\-Walid ibn Uqba ibn Abu Mu’ayt came to face him\. Abdullah ibn Abbas carried the assaults with great steadfastness and courage, giving such a brave fight that the enemy left the field in retreat\.

On the sixth day, Qays ibn Sa\`d al\-Ansari came forward with the army and to face him Ibn Dhi’l\-Kala’ came out with his contingent\. A fierce fighting ensued; at every step, bodies were seen falling and blood flowing like streams\. At last, the darkness of the night separated the two armies\.

On the seventh day, Malik al\-Ashtar came out and to face him, Habib ibn Maslamah came forward with his men and fighting raged till zuhr \(noon\)\.

On the eighth day, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) himself came out

with the army and made such an assault that the entire battlefield quaked and piercing through the ranks and warding off shots of arrows and spears he came and stood between both the lines\. Then he challenged Mu\`awiyah, whereupon the latter, along with Amr ibn al\-As, came a bit closer\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said to him: \`Amr\! Come out and face me\. Let whoever kills the other be the ruler, whereupon \`Amr ibn al\-As said to Mu\`awiyah, “Ali \(x\) is right\. Gather a little courage and face him\.”

Mu\`awiyah replied, “I am not prepared to waste my life at your taunting\.”Having said this much, he went back\. When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) saw him retreating he smiled and himself too returned\. The

daring with which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) led the attacks in Siffin

can only be called a miraculous feat\. Thus, whenever he came out challenging in the battlefield, the enemy lines were dispersed into utter disarray and confusion and even courageous combatants hesitated to appear against him\. That is why on a few occasions he came onto the battlefield in changed outfit so that the enemy should not recognize him and someone should be prepared to engage with him personally\. Once Arar ibn Adham came from the other side to engage with al \-Abbas ibn Rabi\`ah al\-Harith ibn Abdul\- Muttalib\. They remained engaged but neither could defeat the other, until al\-Abbas chanced to see that a link of his adversary’s amour was loose\. With a swift stroke he entangled the point of his sword in it then with a quick jerk he cut through a few more links\. Then with true aim he gave such a blow that his sword went straight into his bosom\. Seeing this, people raised the call of takbir\. Mu\`awiyah was startled at this noise and on coming to know that Arar ibn Adham had been slain he was much disturbed and shouted if there was anyone to take

<a id="page530"></a>revenge for Arar ibn Adham and kill al\-Abbas\. Al\-Abbas came to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) to seek permission\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

detained him, put on al\-Abbas outfit and riding on al\-Abbas’s horse entered the battlefield\. Taking him to be al\-Abbas, the Lakhams said the following: “So you have got your chief’s permission\. In reply Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) recited the following verse:

Permission \(to fight is\) given unto those upon whom war is made for they have been oppressed and verily, to help them, Allah is Most Potent\. \(Holy Quran, 22: 39\)

A man came out from the other side shouting like an elephant, ran amok and assaulted Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), but the Imam avoided

the blow then gave such a clean cut with his sword to the other’s back that he was split into two\. People thought the blow had gone without avail, but when his horse jumped his two separate parts fell on the ground\. After him another man came out but he too was finished in the twinkling of an eye\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) challenged others but from the strokes of his sword the enemy came to know that it was Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) in the outfit of al\-Abbas and so none dared come to face him\.

On the ninth day, the right wing was under the command of Abdullah ibn Budayi and the left wing under that of Abdullah ibn Abbas\. In the center was Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) himself\. On the other side,

Habib ibn Maslamah commanded the Syrian army\. When both the lines had come face\-to\-face with each other, the valiant soldiers drew out their swords and pounced upon one another like ferocious lions and fighting raged on all sides\. The banner of the right wing of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s army was revolving in the hands of Banu Hamdan\. Whenever anyone of them fell, martyred, someone else will pick up the banner\. First of all Kurayb ibn Shurayh raised the banner, on his fall Shurahbil ibn Shurayh took it up, then Marthad ibn Shurayh, then Hubayrah ibn Shurayh then Yarim ibn Shurayh, then Sumayr ibn Shurayh and after the killing of all these six brothers the banner was taken up by Sufyan, then Abd, then Kurayb, the three sons of Zayd, who all fell martyred\. After that the banner was lifted by two brothers \(sons\) of Bashir namely \`Umayr and al \-Harithi and when they too fell martyred, Wahab ibn Kurayb took up the banner\. On this day the enemy’s greater attention was on the right wing and its assaults were so fierce that the men lost ground and began to retreat from the battlefield\. Only three hundred men remained with the Officer in Command Abdullah ibn Budayl\. On seeing

<a id="page531"></a>this Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) asked Malik al\-Ashtar to call them back

and challenge them as to where they were fleeing\. If the days of life are over they cannot avoid death by running away\. Now the defeat of the right wing could not be without effect on the left wing, so Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) turned to the left wing and advanced forward, forcing

through the enemy lines, whereupon a slave of Banu Umayyah named Ahmar said to him, “Allah may cause me to die if I fail to slay you today\!”On hearing this, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s slave Kaysan leapt over him but was killed by him\. When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) saw this, he caught him by the skirt of his amour and, picking him up, threw him down so forcefully that all his joints were smashed, whereupon Imam Hassan \(x\) and Muhammad ibn al\-Hanafiyya came forward and

dispatched him to Hell\. Meanwhile, after having been called to Malik al\-Ashtar and his having made them feel ashamed, those who retreated came back and again assaulted so steadfastly that pushing back the enemy they reached the place where Abdullah ibn Budayl was surrounded by the enemy\. When he saw his own men he picked up courage and leapt towards Mu\`awiyah’s tent with drawn sword\. Malik al\-Ashtar tried to stop him but he could not and, killing seven Syrians, he reached the tent of Mu\`awiyah\. When Mu\`awiyah noticed him close by he ordered him to be stoned, as a result of which he was overpowered and the Syrians crowded over him and killed him\. When Malik al\-Ashtar saw this he proceeded forward with the combatants of Banu Hamdan and Banu Madhhaj for an attack on Mu\`awiyah and began dispersing the contingent on guard around him\. When, out of the five circles of his guards only one remained to be dispersed, Mu\`awiyah put his foot in the stirrup of his horse in order to run away, but on someone’s encouragement again stopped\. On another side of the battlefield a tumult was raging from one end to the other by the swords of Ammar ibn Yasir and Hashim ibn Utbah\. From whatever side Ammar passed, the companions \(of the Holy Prophet \[h\]\) flocked around him then made such a joint assault that

destruction spread throughout the enemy lines\. When Mu\`awiyah saw them advancing he threw his fresh forces towards them\. But he continued displaying the excellence of his bravery under the storm of swords and spears\. At last Abul \-Adiyah al\-Juhani hit him with a spear from which he could not balance himself then Ibn Hawiy \(Jawn as\-Saksiki\) came forward and slew him\. Ammar ibn Yasir’s death caused tumult in Mu\`awiyah’s ranks because about him they had heard the Holy Prophet \(h\) having said the following: “Ammar will be killed at the hands of a

rebellious party\. Thus before he fell as martyr Dhul\-Kala’ had said to \`Amr ibn al\-As, “I see Ammar on Ali’s side; are we that rebellious

<a id="page532"></a>party?” Amr ibn al\- As had assured him that eventually Ammar would join them, but when he was killed fighting on Ali’s side, the rebellious party stood exposed and no room was left for any other interpretation\. Nevertheless Mu\`awiyah started telling the Syrians: “We did not kill Ammar, but Ali did it because he brought him to the battlefield\.”When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) heard this cunning sentence, he remarked, “In

that case, the Holy Prophet \(h\) killed \(his uncle the valiant\) Hamzah

because he had brought him to the battlefield of Uhud\.” Hashim ibn Utbah also fell in this conflict\. He was killed by al\-Harith ibn Mundhir at\-Tanukhi\. After him the banner of the contingent was taken over by his son Abdullah\.

When such fearless warriors were gone, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said to the warriors from the tribes of Hamdan and Rabi\`ah, “To me,

you are like amour and spear\. Get up and teach these rebels a lesson\.”Consequently, twelve thousand combatants from the tribes of Rabi\`ah and Hamdan stood up, swords in hand\. The banner was taken up by Hudyan ibn al\-Mundhir\. Entering the lines of the enemy, they used their swords in such a way that heads began to drop, bodies fell in huge heaps and on every side streams of blood flowed\. And the assaults of those swordsmen knew no stopping till the day began to end with all its devastation\. And the gloom of eve set in, ushering in that fearful night which is known in history as the night of al\-Harir, wherein the clashing of weapons, the hoofs of horses and the hue and cry of the Syrians created such notice that even voices reaching the ears could not be heard\. On Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s side, his wrong\- crushing slogans raised waves of courage and valor and on the enemy’s side they shook the hearts in their bosoms\. The battle was at its zenith\. The quivers of the bowmen had become empty\. The stalks of the spears had been broken\. Hand to hand fighting went on with swords only and dead bodies collected in heaps, till by morning the number of killed had exceeded thirty thousand\.

On the tenth day, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s men showed the same high morale\. On the right wing, Malik al\-Ashtar held the command and on the left wing Abdullah ibn Abbas\. Assaults went on like the assaults of new soldiers\. Signs of defeat appeared on the Syrians and they were about to leave the battlefield and run away, when five hundred Holy Qurans were raised on spears changing the entire face of the battle\. Moving swords stopped, the weapon of deceit was successful and the way was clear for wrong to hold its sway\.

<a id="page533"></a>In this battle forty\-five thousand Syrians were killed while twenty\-five thousand Iraqis fell as martyrs as we read in Kitab Siffin by Nasr ibn Muzahim al\-Minqari \[d\. 212 A\.H\.\] and Tarikh al\-Tabari, Vol\. 1, pp\. 3256\-3349\)\.
