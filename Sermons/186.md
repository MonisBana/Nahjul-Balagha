**Sermon 186**

**Regarding the Vicissitudes of Time \(The Mischief That Is to Occur and the Absence of Lawful Ways of Livelihood\)**

May my father and mother be sacrificed for those few whose names are well\-known in the heavens while not known on the earth\! Beware, you should expect what is to befall you, such as adversity in your affairs, severance of relations and the rising up of inferior people\. This will happen when the blow of a sword will be easier for a believer than to secure one dirham lawfully\. This will happen186 when the reward of the beggar is more than that of the giver\. This will be when you are intoxicated, not by drinking, but with wealth and plenty, swearing without compulsion and speaking lies without compulsion\. This will be when troubles hurt you as the saddle hurts the hump of the camel\. How long will these tribulations be and how distant the hope \(for deliverance from them\)?

186During such a period, the reward of the beggar who takes \(charity\) will be higher than that of the giver because of the ways of earning livelihood\. Such means earned by the rich will be unlawful; so, whatever one donates of it, its purpose will be to show off, for the sake of hypocrisy and fame for which he will not be entitled to any reward, while the poor who takes it by force of the necessity of their poverty and helplessness and spend it in the right manner will deserve more reward and recompense\.

<a id="page641"></a>O people\! Throw away the reins of the horses that carry on their backs the weight of your hands have committed \(i\.e\. your sins\)\. Do not cut away from your chief \(Imam\); otherwise, you will blame yourselves for your own doings\. Do not jump in the fire which is in flames in front of you; keep away from its courses and leave the middle way for it\. Because, by my life, a believer will die in its flames while others will remain safe\.

I am among you like a lamp in the darkness\. Whoever enters by it will be lit\. So listen, O men\! Preserve it and remain attentive with the ears of your hearts so that you may understand\.

The commentator, Ibn Abul\- Hadid, has written another meaning of it: If the beggar does not take the wealth from the rich, so it remains with the latter, they will spend it on unlawful matters and enjoyments\. Since the beggarâ€™s taking the wealth from the rich prevents the latter from using wealth for unlawful things, hence there will be prevention from evil, the beggar deserves more rewards and compensations \(Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 13, p\. 97\)\.
