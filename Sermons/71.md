**Here, Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Tells People How to Pronounce the Asalawat \(To Invoke Divine Blessings on the Prophet \[h\]\):**

O Lord\! Spreader of the surfaces \(of earth\) and Keeper \(intact\) of all skies, Creator of hearts on good and evil nature, \(I invoke You to\) send Your choicest blessings and growing favors on Muhammad \(h\), Your

servant and last Prophet \(h\), opener for what is closed, proclaimer of

truth with truth, repulser of the forces of wrong and crusher of the onslaughts of misguidance\. As he was burdened \(with responsibility of Prophethood\) so he bore it standing by Your commands, advancing towards Your will, without shrinking of steps of weakness of determination, listening to Your revelation, preserving Your testament, proceeding forward in the spreading of Your commands till he lit fire for its seeker and lit the path for the groper in the dark\.

Hearts achieved guidance through him after being ridden with troubles\. He introduced clear guiding signs and shining injunctions\. He is Your trusted trustee, the treasurer of Your treasured knowledge, Your witness on the Day of Judgement, Your envoy of truth and Your Messenger towards the people\. My Allah prepare a large place for him under Your shade and award him multiplying good by Your bounty\.

<a id="page448"></a>My God, give height to his construction above all other constructions, heighten his status with You, grant perfection to his glory and perfect for him his light\. In reward for his discharging Your Prophethood, grant him that his testimony be admitted and his speech be loved for his speech is just and his judgements are clear\-cut\. My Allah put us and him together in the pleasure of life, continuance of bounty, satisfaction of desires, enjoyment of pleasures, ease of living, peace of mind and gifts of honor\.
