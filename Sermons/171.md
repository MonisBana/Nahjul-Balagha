**About the Consultative Committee and the Battle of Jamal**

Praise be to Allah from Whose view one sky does not conceal another sky nor one earth another earth\!

**Part of the same sermon: About the “Consultative**

**Committee” After the Death of \`Umar ibn al\-Khattab**:

<a id="page602"></a>Someone176 said to me, “O son of Abu Talib\! You covet the caliphate\.” I said to him, “Rather, you are, by Allah, more greedy, although more remote from it, while I am more suited as well as nearer\. I have demanded it as my right, while you are intervening between me and it and you are turning my face from it\.” When I knocked at his ears with arguments among the crowd of those present he was startled as if he was stunned not knowing what reply to give me about it\.

O Lord\! I seek Your succor against the tribesmen of Quraish and those who are assisting them because they are denying me \(the rights of\) kinship, have lowered my high status and are united in opposing me in the matter \(of the caliphate\) which is my right then they said, “Be informed that the rightful thing is that you have it and also that you may leave it\.”177

“They \(the tribesmen of Quraish and those who are assisting them\) were not only content to keep me away from my right over the

176During the incident of the Consultative Committee, Sa\`d ibn Abu Waqqas repeated to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) what \`Umar had said in his last hours, that is, that “O Ali\! You are very greedy for the status of Caliphate\.” Ali \(x\) replied: “He who demands his own right cannot be called greedy; rather,

greedy is he who prevents the securing of ones right and tries to grab it despite being unfit for it\.”

There is no doubt that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) considered the

Caliphate to be his right and demanded it\. The demand for one’s right does not dispel a right so that it may be put forth as an excuse for not assigning him the caliphate, and the demand may be held as a sign of greed\. Even if it was greed, who was not involved in this greed? Was not the pull between the Muhajirun and the Ansar, the mutual struggle between the members of the “Consultative Committee” and the mischief mongering of Talhah and az\-Zubayr the product of this very greed? If Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had been greedy for this status,

he would have stood for it regardless of tis consequences and outcomes\. When Abbas \(uncle of the Prophet \[h\]\) and Abu Sufyan pressed him to \(accept to

swear the oath of\) allegiance, and when, after the third Caliph, people thronged to him for \(swearing\) allegiance, he had to accept their offer regardless of the deteriorated conditions\. But at no time did Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) take any

step which indicated that he wanted the Caliphate for the sake of caliphate\. Rather, his demand for the caliphate was only with the objective that its aspects should not be altered, and the religion should not become the victim of others’ desires, not that he should enjoy the pleasures of life which could be attributed to greed\.

177Explaining the meaning, Ibn Abul\-Hadid writes that Imam Ali ibn

Abu Talib’s intention was to say:

<a id="page603"></a>caliphate which they have usurped \(from me\), but rather claimed that it was their right whether to give it to me or prevent me from the same, and that I have no right to argue with them\.”Furthermore, the intention \(of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\) was as follows: “Had they not said that it

was right to keep away from the caliphate, it would have been easy to endure it\. This is so because this will have, at least, showed their admitting my right although they were not prepared to concede it” \(Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 9, p\. 306\)\.

**Part of the Same Sermon: Describing the People of Jamal**

They \(Talhah, az\-Zubayr and their supporters\) came out dragging the wife of the Messenger of Allah \(Aisha\) just as a bondmaid is dragged for sale\. They took her to Basra where those two \(Talhah and az\-Zubayr\) put their own women in their houses while exposing the wife of the Messenger of Allah to themselves and to others in the army in which there was not a single individual who had not pledged his obedience and sworn to me allegiance quite willingly, without any compulsion\.

Here in Basra, they approached my Governor and coffers of the public treasury, the funds of its other inhabitants\. They killed some of them in captivity as well as others in treachery\. By Allah, even if they had willfully killed only one individual from among the Muslims without any fault, it will have been lawful for me to kill all of this army because they were present in it but did not disagree with it nor prevented it by tongue or hand, not to say that they killed from among the Muslims a number equal to that with which they had marched on them\.
