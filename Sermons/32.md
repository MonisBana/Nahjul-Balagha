**About the Disparagement of the World and Categories of its**

**People**

O people\! We have been born in such a wrongful and thankless period wherein the virtuous is deemed vicious and the oppressor goes on advancing in his excess\. We do not make use of what we know and do not discover what we do not know\. We do not fear calamity till it befalls\.

People are of four categories\. Among them is one who is prevented from mischief only by his low status, lack of means and paucity of wealth\.

Then there is he who has drawn his sword, openly commits mischief, has collected his horsemen and foot\-man and has devoted himself to securing wealth, leading troops, rising on the pulpit and has allowed his faith to perish\. How bad is the transaction that you allow, \(enjoyment of\) this world to be a price for yourself as an alternative for what there is with Allah for you\.

And among them is he who seeks \(benefits of\) this world through actions meant for the next world, but does not seek \(good of\) the next world through actions of this world\. He keeps his body calm \(in dignity\), raises small steps, holds up his clothe s, embellishes his body for appearance of trust\-worthiness and uses the status of Allah’s connivance as a means of committing sins\.

Then there is one whose weakness and lack of means have held him back from conquest of lands\. This keeps down his status and he has named it contentment and he clothe s himself with the robe of renunciation although he has never had any connection with these qualities\.

<a id="page410"></a>Then there remain a few people in whose case the remembrance of their return \(to Allah on the Last Day\) keeps their eyes bent and the fear of resurrection moves their tears\. Some of them are scared away \(from the world\) and dispersed\. Some are frightened and subdued; some are quiet as if muzzled; some are praying sincerely\. Some are grief\-stricken and pain\-ridden whom fear has confined to namelessness and disgrace has shrouded them, so they are in \(The sea of\) bitter water\. Their mouths are closed and their hearts are bruised\. They preached till they were tired, they were oppressed till they were disgraced and they were killed till they remained few in number\.

The world in your eyes should be smaller than the bark of the acacia and the clippings of wool\. Seek instruction from those who preceded you before those who follow you take instruction from you and keep aloof from it realizing its evil because it cuts off even from those who were more attached to it than you\.

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “Some ignorant persons attributed this sermon to Mu\`awiyah but it is the speech of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)\. There should be no doubt about it\. What comparison is

there between gold and clay or sweet and bitter water\.” This has been pointed out by the skillful guide and the expert critic \`Amr ibn Bahr al\-Jahiz as he has mentioned this sermon in his book, Al\-Bayan wal\-Tbyin \(Vol\. 2, pp\. 59\-61\)\. He has also mentioned who attributed it to Mu\`awiyah then states that it is most akin to be the speech of Ali and most in accord with his way of categorizing people and information about their oppression, disgrace, apprehension and fear\. \(On the other hand\) we never found Mu\`awiyah speaking on the lives of those who renounce this world or worshippers\.
