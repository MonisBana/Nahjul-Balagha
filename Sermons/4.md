**Amir Al\-Mu’minin’s Far\-Sightedness and Staunch Conviction**

<a id="page357"></a>Through us you got guidance in the darkness and secured a high status\. And through us you got out of the gloomy night\. The ears which do not listen to the cries may become deaf\. How can one who remained deaf to the loud cries \(of the Holy Quran and the Prophet \[h\]\) listen to

\(my\) feeble voice\. The heart that has ever palpitated \(with fear of Allah\) may get peace\.

I always apprehended from you consequences of treachery and I had seen you through in the garb of the deceitful\. The curtain of the religion had kept me hidden from you but the truth of my intentions disclosed you to me\. I stood for you on the path of truth among misleading tracks were you met each other, but there was no leader and you dug but got no water\.

Today, I am making these dumb things peak to you \(i\.e\. my suggestive ideas and deep musing, etc\.\) which are full of descriptive power\. The opinion of the person who abandons me may get astray\. I have never doubted the truth since it was shown to me\. Musa \(Moses\)118 did not entertain fear for his own self\. Rather, he feared the mastery of the ignorant and the path towards deviation\. Nowadays, we stand on the crossroads of truth and falsehood\. The one who is sure of getting water feels no thirst\.

Amir al\-Mu’minin says that the ground for Moses’ fear was not that since he saw ropes and sticks moving he might have entertained fear for his life, but the cause of his fear was lest people be impressed with this sorcery and get astray and untruth might prevail on account of this craft\. That is why Moses was not consoled by saying that his life was safe but by saying that he would prove superior and his claim would be upheld\. Since his fear was for the defeat of the truth and victory of falsehood, not for his own life, the consideration was given to him for the victory of truth and not for the protection of his life\.

Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) also means that he too, had the same fear meaning that the people should not be caught in the trap of these \(Talhah,

118The reference refers to Moses when sorcerers were sent for to confront him and they demonstrated their sorcery by throwing ropes and sticks on the ground and Moses felt afraid\. Thus, the Holy Quran records: “It seemed to him \(Moses\), by their sorcery as if they were running\. Then Moses felt in himself a fear\. We said: Fear not\! Verily, you are the uppermost \(20: 66\-68\)\.

<a id="page358"></a>az\-Zubayr, etc\.\) and fall into misguidance by getting astray from the true faith\. otherwise, he himself never feared for his own life\.
