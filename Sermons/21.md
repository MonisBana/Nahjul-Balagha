**Sermon 21**

**Advice to Keep Light in this World**

Your aim \(reward or punishment\) is before you\. Behind your back is the hour \(of resurrection\) which is driving you on\. Keep \(yourself\) light and overtake \(the forward ones\)\. Your last ones are being awaited by the first ones \(who have preceded you\)\.

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “If this utterance of Ali \(x\) is weighed with any other utterance except the words of Allah or of the Holy Prophet \(h\), it would prove heavier and superior in every respect\.

For example, Ali’s saying “keep light and overtake’ is the shortest expression every heard with the greatest sense conveyed\. How broad its meaning is and how clear its spring of wisdom\! We have pointed out the greatness and meaningfulness of this phrase in our book Al\-Khasa’is\.
