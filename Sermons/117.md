**In Praise Of His Faithful Companions :**

159The detail of this incident is that one day al\-Hajjaj stood up for saying prayers when al\-khunfusa advanced towards him\. Al\-Hajjaj held out his hand to stop him but he bit him whereby his hand got swollen and eventually he died of it\. Ibn Abul\-Hadad has written that al\-Wadhahah means the dung that remains sticking to the tail of an animal and this surname is intended to disgrace him\.

<a id="page519"></a>You are supporters of Truth and brethren in faith\. You are the shield on the day of tribulation and \(my\) trustees among the rest of the people\. With your support I strike the runner away and hope for the obedience of him who advances forward\. Therefore, extend to me support which is free from deceit and pure from doubt because, by Allah, I am the most preferable of all for the people\.
