**Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Relating His Own Condition after the Prophet’s Migration till Their Meeting**

I began to follow the path adopted by the Prophet \(h\) and tread on the tracks of his remembrance till I reached al\-Arj\.

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s words “faata’u dhikrahu” constitute the highest forms of brevity and eloquence\. He means to say that he was being given news about the Prophet \(h\) from the commencement of his setting out till he reached this place, and he has expressed this notion in this wonderful expression\.”

Since the inception of Prophethood, the Prophet \(h\) remained in

Mecca for thirteen years\. For him, this period was one of the most severe oppression and destitution\. The unbelievers from the Quraish tribe had closed all the doors of livelihood against him, sparing no means to inflict hardship upon him, so much so that in order to put an end to his life, they began plotting with each other as to how to do so\. Forty of their dignitaries assembled in the hall of audience \(Dar an\-Nadwa\) for consultation and decided that one individual should be picked out from

<a id="page729"></a>every tribe, then they would jointly attack him\. In this way, Banu Hashim would not dare to face all the other tribes, and the matter would quiet down on the payment of blood money\. To give a practical shape to this scheme, these people lay in ambush near the house of the Prophet \(h\) on

the night of the first of Rabi’al\-Awwal\. As the Prophet \(h\) slept in his

bed, he was to be thus attacked\. On one hand, the preparation for killing him was complete\. On the other hand, Allah informed him of all the intrigues of the unbelieving tribesmen of Quraish, commanding him to let Ali \(x\) sleep in his bed while he himself had to immigrate to Medna\. The

Prophet \(h\) sent for Ali \(x\)\. Disclosing to him his plan, he said the following: “Ali \(x\)\! Lie in my bed\.” Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) inquired: “O Messenger of Allah\! Will your life be saved by my sleeping here?” The Prophet \(h\) said, “Yes\.” Hearing this, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) performed a prostration as a token of thanks\-giving and, exposing himself fully to the danger, lay on the Prophet’s bed while the Prophet \(h\)

departed\. The unbelieving tribesmen of Quraish were peeping and getting ready for the attack\. Abu Lahab said, “It is not proper to attack in the night because there are women and children also living in the house\. When the morning dawns, you should attack him, but keep watch during the night lest he should not move and go anywhere else\.” Consequently, they kept their eyes on the bed throughout the night and soon\. When dawn drew nigh, they proceeded stealthily\. Hearing the sound of their footsteps, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) removed the covering from his face and

stood up\. The tribesmen of Quraish gazed at him with disbelieving eyes as to whether it was an illusion or a fact\. After making sure that it was Ali, they inquired, “Where is Muhammad \(h\)?” Ali replied, “Did you

entrust him to me so that now you are asking me about him?\!” They had no reply\. Men ran to pursue him but found footprints only up to the cave \[of Hira\] in themountain of Thawr\. Beyond that, there were neither footprints nor any sign of hiding in the cave\. They came back bewildered while the Prophet \(h\), after staying in the cave for three days, left for

Medina\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) passed these three days in Mecca, returned to the people their properties which they had entrusted the Prophet \(k\) to safeguard for them then set off towards Medna to join the Prophet \(h\)\. Up to al\-Arj, a place between Mecca and Medina, he kept getting news about the Prophet \(h\) and he maintained his anxious march till he finally met the Prophet \(h\) at Quba on the twelfth of Rabi’ al\-Awwal where the Prophet \(k\) was waiting for him, refusing to enter Medina without him \(al\-Tabari, Tafsir, Vol\. 9, pp\. 148\-151; Tarikh, Vol\.
