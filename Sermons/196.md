**Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib’s Attachment to the Holy Prophet \(h\), Performance of Funeral Rites for Him \(h\)**

<a id="page672"></a>Those companions of Muhammad \(k\), the custodians \(of the

Divine messages\), know that I never disobeyed Allah or His Messenger1 at all and by virtue of the courage with which Allah honored me, I supported him with my life on occasions when even the brave turned away and feet lagged behind\.

When the Prophet \(h\) died, his head was on my chest and his

\(last\) breath blew over my palms, and I passed it over my face\. I performed his funeral ghusul \(ceremonial bath\), may Allah bless him and his descendants, and the angels helped me\. The house and the courtyard were full of them\. One party of them was descending while another was ascending\. My ears continually caught their humming voice, as they invoked Allah’s blessing on him, till we buried him in his grave\. Thus, who can have greater rights with him than I during his life or after his death? Therefore, depend on your enemy because I swear by the One Who is such that there is no god but He, that I am on the path of truth and that they \(the enemy\) are on the misleading path of wrongdoing\. You hear what I say and I seek Allah’s forgiveness for myself and for you\.

Ibn Abul\-Hadid has written \(in Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 10,

1. 180\-183\) that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s saying that he never disobeyed the commands of the Prophet \(h\) is a sort of taunt to those

who felt no hesitation in rejecting the Prophet’s commands and sometimes even checked him\. For example, when, at the time of the peace of al\-Hudaybiya, the Prophet \(h\) was inclined to negotiate peace with

the unbelievers from among the tribesmen of Quraish, one of the companions became so enraged that he expressed doubts about the Prophethood of the Prophet \(h\) whereupon Abu Bakr had to say: “Woe

be to you\! Keep clinging to him\. He is certainly Allah’s Messenger, and He will not ruin him\.”

The introduction to the oath, “inna” and the word of emphasis “lam”, which are used here \[in the original Arabic text\] to create conviction about the Prophethood shows that the addressee had gone further than mere doubt because these words of emphasis are employed only when the stage of denial has been reached\. However, if belief required absence of doubt, the presence of doubt must imply defect in the belief, as Allah says the following: “The believers are only those who believe in Allah and His Messenger, they do not doubt thereafter” \(Holy Quran, 49: 15\)\.

<a id="page673"></a>Similarly, when the Prophet \(h\) intended to perform the funeral

prayers for Ubayy ibn Salul, the same companion said to him, “How do you intend to seek forgiveness for this chief of hypocrites?” And he even drew away the Prophet \(h\) by pulling the ends of his shirt\.\.\. Then the

Prophet \(h\) had to say, “No deed nothing besides the command of

Allah\.” In the same way, the Prophet’s command to accompany the troops led by Usamah ibn Zayd was ignored\. The greatest of all such insolence was displayed with regard to the Prophet’s intention to write down his advice to the nation\. When such a blame was laid against the Prophet \(h\), a behavior which proves an absence of belief in the commands of

the Shari’a and creates doubt about whether each command was based on the Divine revelation or whether \(Allah forbid\) it was just the result of “mental disorder”\.

Who can deny that the ever\-successful lion of Allah, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), shielded the Prophet \(h\) on every critical occasion

and performed the duty of protecting him by dint of the courage and valor gifted to him by Allah? The first occasion of risking his life was when the unbelievers from the tribe of Quraish decided finally to kill the Prophet \(h\)\. Ali slept on the Prophet’s bed surrounded by enemies and under the

direct peril of swords, whereby the enemies were not able to succeed in their plot\. Then, in those battles where the enemies used to attack the Prophet \(h\) and where the feet of even the reputed heroes could not

stand firm, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) remained steadfast with the

banner \(of Islam\) in his hand\. Abdul\-Barr and al\-Hakim writes the following about it: “Ibn Abbas says that Ali had four qualities which no one else possessed\. First, he was the first among the Arabs and the non\-Arabs to have offered prayers with the Messenger of Allah\. Second, he always had the banner of Islam in his hand in every battle\. Third, when people ran away from the Prophet \(h\), Ali remained with him, and

Fourth, he was the one who gave the Prophet \(h\) his funeral ablution and

placed him in his grave” \(Al_Isti’ab, Vol\. 3, p\. 1090; Al\-Mustadrak Ala Sahihayn, Vol\. 3, p\. 111\)\.

A study of the holy wars of Islam fought during the Prophet’s time leaves no doubt that, except for the battle of Tabuk in which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) did not participate, all other battles testify to his

great performance and all the successes are due to his valour\. Thus, in the battle of Badr, seventy unbelievers were killed, half of whom were killed by Ali’s sword\. In the battle of Uhud, when victory changed into defeat as

<a id="page674"></a>a result of the Muslims engaging themselves in the collection of booty, they fled away under the sudden attack of the enemy, but Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) remained steadfast, taking jihad to be a religious obligation and displayed such conspicuous courage in support and in defense of the Prophet \(h\) that the Prophet \(h\) himself acknowledged it as did arch\-angel Gabriel\. Again, in the battle of the Trench \(al\-Khandaq\), the Prophet \(h\) was accompanied by three thousand combatants, but none dared to face \`Amr ibn Abd\-Wudd\. At last, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

killed him and saved the Muslims from ignominy\. In the battle of Hunain, the Muslims were proud of their number because they were ten thousand while the unbelievers were only four thousand, but here, too, they leapt onto the booty, as a consequence of which the unbelievers gained the opportunity and pounced upon them\. Taken by surprise thus, the Muslims fled away as the Holy Quran says the following verse: “Most certainly did Allah help you in many \(battle\) fields and on the day of Hunain when made your great number was to your liking, but your being superior in number availed you nothing, and the earth was straitened against you despite its expanse, then you turned back in retreat” \(9: 25\)\.

On this occasion, too, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) remained

steadfast like a rock and eventually, with Allah’s support, victory was achieved\.
