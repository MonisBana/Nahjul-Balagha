**About Amr ibn al\-As**

<a id="page463"></a>I am surprised at the son of an\-Nabighah that he says among the people of Syria that I am a jester and that I am engaged in frolic and fun\. He said wrong and spoke sinfully\. Beware, the worst speech is what is untrue\. He speaks and lies\. He promises and breaks the promise\. He begs and sticks, but when someone begs from him he withholds miserly\. He betrays the pledge and ignores kinship\.

When in a battle, he commands and admonishes but only until the swords do not come into action\. When such a moment arrives his great trick is to turn naked149

before his adversary\. By Allah, surely the remembrance of death has kept me away from fun and play while obliviousness about the Hereafter has prevented him from speaking truth\. He has not sworn allegiance to Mu\`awiyah without purpose; but has beforehand got him to agree that he would have to pay its price and gave him an award for forsaking religion\.
