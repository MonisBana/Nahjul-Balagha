**When Amir Al\-Mu’minin’s Showed Impatience on His Delay in Giving Them Permission to Fight in Siffin, He Said:**

As for your idea whether this \(delay\) is due to my unwillingness for death, then by Allah I do not care whether I proceed towards death or death advances towards me\. As for your impression that it may be due to my misgivings about the people of Syria, by Allah, I did not put off war even for a day except in the hope that some group may join me, find guidance through me and see my light with their weak eyes\. This is dearer to me than to kill them in the state of this misguidance although they would be bearing their own sins\.
