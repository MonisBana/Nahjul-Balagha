**Against Misplaced Generosity**

He who shows generosity to those who have no claim to it or who are not fit for it will not earn anything except the praise of the ignoble and appreciation of bad persons\. Although as long as he continues giving, the ignorant will say how generous his hand is, even though in the affairs of Allah he is a miser\.

Therefore, to whosoever Allah gives wealth he should use it in extending good behavior to his kinsmen, in entertaining, in releasing prisoners and the afflicted; in giving to the poor and to debtors\. And he should endure \(the troubles arising out of\) the fulfillment of rights \(of others\) and hardships in expectation of reward\. Certainly, the achievement of these qualities is the height of greatness in this world and achievement of the distinctions of the next world, if Allah so wills\.
