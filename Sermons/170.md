**Sermon 170**

**When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) decided to fight the enemy face\-to\-face at Siffin he said the following: **\.

â€œO Lord\! O Sustainer of the high sky, Suspender of the firmament which You have made a shelter for the night and the day, an orbit for the sun and the moon and a path for the rotating stars and for populating it\! You have created a group of Your angels who do not get weary of worshipping You\. O Sustainer of this earth which You have made an abode for people and a place for the movement of insects, beasts and countless other creatures, seen and unseen\! O Sustainer of strong mountains which You have made as pegs for the earth and \(a means of\) support for people\! Grant us victory over our enemy, O Lord, save us from excesses and keep us on the straight path of truth\! But if You grant them victory over us, then grant us martyrdom and save us from mischief\.

Where are those who protect honor and those self\-respecting persons who defend respectable people in the time of hardship? Shame is behind you while Paradise is in front of you\.
