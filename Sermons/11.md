**Sermon 11**

**Delivered during the Battle of Jamal when Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) gave the standard to his son Muhammad ibn al\-Hanafiyya**

Mountains 2 may move from their status, but you should not move from yours\. Grit your teeth\. Lend to Allah your head \(in fighting for Allah, give yourself to Allah\)\. Plant your feet firmly on the ground\. Have your eye on the remotest foe and close your eyes \(to their numberical majority\)\. And be sure that succor is but from Allah, the Glorified\.

Muhammad ibn al \-Hanafiyya was Amir al\-Mu’minin’s son but called Ibn Hanafiyya after his mother\. His mother’s name was Khawla daughter of Ja\`far\. She was known as Hanafiyya after her tribe Banu Hanifah\. When people of Yamama were declared, “postates for refusing to pay zakat \(religious tax\) and were killed and the women were brought to Medina as slave girls, this lady also came to Medina with them\. When her tribesmen came to know it they approached Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)

and requested him to save her from the blemish of slavery and protect her family honor and prestige\. Consequently, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) purchased her, set her free and married her where after, Muhammad \(h\) was born\.

Most historians have written his surname as Abul\-Qasim\. Thus, the author of Al\-Isti’ab \(Vol\. 3\. pp\. 1366\-1368, 1370\- 1372\) has narrated the opinion of Abu Rashd ibn Hafs az\-Zuhri that from among the sons of the companions \(of the Prophet \[h\]\) he came across four individuals

everyone of whom was named Muhammad and surnamed Abul\-Qasim, namely \(1\) Muhammad ibn al\-Hanafiyya, \(2\) Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr

1. Muhammad ibn Talhah and \(4\) Muhammad ibn Sa\`d\. After this he writes that Muhammad ibn Talhah’s name and surname were given by the Prophet \(h\)\. Al\-Waqidi writes that the name of surname of Muhammad

ibn Abu Bakr was suggested by Aisha\. Apparently the Holy Prophet’s giving the name of Muhammad ibn Talhah seems incorrect since from some traditions it appears that the Prophet \(h\) had reserved it for a son of

Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) and he was Muhammad ibn al\-Hanafiyya\.

<a id="page365"></a>As regarding his surname it is said that the Prophet \(h\) had

particularized it and that he had told Ali that a son would be born to you after me and I have given him my name and surname and after that it is not permissible for anyone in my people to have this name and surname together\.

With this opinion before us, how can it be correct that the Prophet \(h\) had given this very name and surname to anyone else since

particularization means that no one else would share it\. Moreover, some people have recorded the surname of Ibn Talhah as Abu Sulayman instead of Abul\- Qasim and this further confirms our viewpoint\. Similarly, if the surname of Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr was on the ground that his son’s name was Qasim, who was among the theologians of Medians, then what is the sense in Aisha having suggested it\. If she had suggested it along with the name, how could Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr tolerate it later on since having been brought up under the care of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) the

Prophet’s saying could not remain concealed form him\. Moreover, most people have recorded his surname as Abu Abd ar\-Rahman, which weakens the view of Abu Rashid\.

Let alone these people’s surname being Abul\- Qoim, even for ibn al\-Hanafiyya this surname is not proved\. Although ibn Khallikan \(in Wafiyyat al\-A’yan, Vol\. 4, p\. 170\) has taken that some of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) for whom the Prophet \(h\) had particularized this surname

to be Muhammad ibn al\-Hanafiyya, yet allama al\-Mamaqani \(in Tanqih al\-Maqal, Vol\. 3, Part 1, p\. 112\) writes the following:

In applying this tradition to Muhammad ibn al\-Hanafiyya, Ibn Khallikan has got into confusion because the son of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) whom the Prophet’s name and surname together have been gifted by

the Prophet \(h\) and which is not permissible to be given to any one else,

is to the awaited last Imam \(may our lives be his ransom\) and not to Muhammad ibn al\-Hanafiyya, nor is the surname Abul\-Qasim established for him, rather some of the Sunnis being ignorant of the real intention of the Prophet \(h\), have taken to mean Ibn al\-Hanafiyya\.

However, Muhammad ibn al\-Hanafiyya was prominent in righteousness and piety, sublime in renunciation and worship, lofty in knowledge and achievements and heir of his father in bravery\. His performance in the Battle of Jamal and Siffin had created such impression among the Arabs that even warriors of consequence trembled at this

<a id="page366"></a>name\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) too was proud of his courage and valor and

always placed him forward in encounters\. Shaikh al \-Baha’i has written in al\-Kashkul that Ali ibn Abu Talib kept him abreast in the battles and did not allow Hassan and Hussain to go ahead and used to say, “He is my son while these two are sons of the Prophet of Allah \(k\)\. When a Kharijite said to ibn al\-Hanafiyya that Ali thrust him into the flames of war but saved away Hassan and Hussain \(x\), he replied that he himself was like

the right hand and Hassan and Hussain \(x\) like Ali’s two eyes and that Ali

protected his eyes with his right hand\. But Allama al\-Mamaqani has written in Tanqih al\-Maqal that his was not the reply of Ibn al\-Hanafiyya, but of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) himself\. When during the battle of Siffin

Muhammad mentioned this matter to Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) in a

complaining tone, he replied, “You are my right hand whereas they are my eyes and the hand should protect the eyes\.

Apparently it seems that first Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) must have

given this reply and thereafter someone might have mentioned it to Muhammad ibn al\-Hanafiyya and he must have repeated the same reply as there could not be a more eloquent reply than this one and its eloquence confirms the view that it was originally the outcome of the eloquent tongue of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) and was later appropriated by

Muhammad \(h\) al\-Hanafiyya\. Consequently, both these views can be

held to be correct and there is no incongruity between them\. However, he was bo5rn in the reign of the second Caliph and died in the reign of Abdul\-Malik ibn Marwan at the age of sixty\-five years\. Some writers have recorded the year of his death as 80 A\.H\. And others as 81 A\.H\. There is a difference about the place of his death as well\. Some have put it as Medina, some Aylah and some Ta’if\.

2\. When in the Battle of Jamal Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) sent

Muhammad ibn al\-Hanafiyya to the battle field, he told him that he should fix himself before the enemy like the mountain of determination and resolution so that the onslaught of the army should not be able to displace him and he should charge the enemy with closed teeth because by pressing the teeth over the teeth, tension occurs in the nerves of the skull\. As a result of which the stroke of the sword goes amiss as he said at another place, “Press together your teeth\. It sends amiss the edge of the sword\.” Then he says, “My child, lend your head to Allih in order that you may be able to achieve eternal life in place of this one because for a lent article there is the right to get it back\. Therefore, you should fight

<a id="page367"></a>being heedless of your life; otherwise, also if your mind clings to life, you will hesitate to advance toward deathly encounters and that would fall upon your reputation of bravery\. Look, do not let your steps falter because the enemy is emboldened at the faltering of steps and faltering steps fastens the feet of the enemy\. Keep the last lines of the enemy as your aim so that the enemy may be overawed with loftiness of your intentions and you may feel ease in tearing through their lives and their movement should also not remain concealed form you\. Look, do not pay heed to their superiority in numbers, otherwise, your valor and courage would suffer\.” This statement can also mean that one should open the eyes wide to be dazzled by the shining of weapons and the enemy may make at attack by taking advantage of the situation\. Also, always bear in mind that victory is from Allah\. “If Allah helps you, no one can overpower you\.” Therefore, instead of relying on material means, seek His support and succor\.

Remember O Believers\! If Allah helps you, none shall overcome you \(Holy Quran, 3: 159\)\.
