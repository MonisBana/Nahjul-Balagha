**The Greatness of Allah and the Creation of the Universe**

It is through the strength of Allah’s Greatness and Subtle Power of innovation that He made solid dry earth out of the water of the fathomless, compact and dashing ocean\. Then He made from it layers and separated them into seven skies they had been joined together\. So, they became stationary at His command, stopping at the limit fixed by Him\. He made the earth that is born deep blue, surrounded with water which is obedient to His command and to His awe while its flow has stopped due to fear of Him\.

He also created high hills, rocks and lofty mountains\. He put them in their positions and made them remain stationary\. Their peaks stretched into the air while their roots remained in the water\. In this way, He realized the mountains above the plains and fixed their foundations in the vast expanse wherever they stood\. He made their peaks high and their mass lofty\. He made them like pillars for the earth in which He fixed them like pegs\. Consequently, the earth became stationary lest it should bend with its inhabitants, or sink inwards with its burden, or shift from its positions\.

Therefore, glorified is Whoever stopped it after the flowing of its waters and solidified it after the watery state of its sides\. In this way He made it a cradle for His creatures and spread it for them in the form of a floor over the deep ocean which is stationary and does not move; it is fixed and does not flow\. Severe winds move it here and there and clouds draw up water from it\.
