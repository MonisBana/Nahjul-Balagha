**One Should Not Be Afraid of the Scarcity of Those Who Tread on the Right Path**

O people\! Do not wonder at the small number of those who follow the right path because people throng only around the table \(of this world\) whose edibles are few but whose hunger is insatiable\.

O people\! Certainly what gathers people together is \(their\) agreement \(to good or bad\) and \(their\) disagreement, for only one individual killed the camel of Thamud190 but Allah held all of them as

190Thamud, an ancient Arabian tribe or group of tribes, seems to have been prominent from about the 4th Century B\.C\. to the first half of the 7th Century A\.D\. Their homeland, called the Valley of al\-Qura \[Wadi al\-Qura, valley of the towns\], was lying on the way between Hijaz and Syria and bore this name because it consisted of several towns\. Allah deputed for their guidance and directions Prophet Salih who preached to them as Allah relates in his story: “And to \(the people of\) Thamud \(We did send\) their brother Salih\. He said, ‘O my people\! Worship Allah \(alone\); you have no god other than Him\. Indeed there came to you a clear proof from your Master: this is the she\-camel of Allah \(which\) to you is a Sign; so, leave it to pasture in Allah’s earth and do not touch her with any harm or else you should be seized with a painful chastisement\. And remember when He made you successors after the \(people\) of Ad and settled you in the land\. You build mansions on its plain and hew the mountains into dwellings\. So, remember the bounties of Allah and do not seek to do mischief on earth\.’ Said the chiefs of those who were puffed up with pride from among his people to those who were regarded as weak to those who believed from among them \(sarcastically\): ‘Do you know that Salih is sent by his Lord?\!’ Said they: ‘Verily, we believe in what he has been sent\.’ Said those who were puffed up with pride: ‘Verily we, in that which you believe, are disbelievers\.’ They hamstrung the she\-camel and rebelled against the command of their Lord and

Then their land declined by sinking \(into earth\) as the spike of a plough pierces unploughed weak land\. O people\! Whoever treads the clear path \(of guidance\) reaches the spring of water, and whoever abandons it strays into a barren desert\.
