**Sermon 218**

**Qualities of the God\-Fearing and the Pious**

He \(the believer\) kept his mind alive and killed \(the desires of\) his heart till his body became thin, his bulk turned light and a glory of extreme brightness shone for him\. It lighted the way for him and took him on the \(right\) path\. Different doors led him to the door of safety and the place of \(his permanent\) stay\. His feet, balancing his body, became fixed in the status of safety and comfort because he kept his heart \(in good deeds\) and pleased his Lord\.
