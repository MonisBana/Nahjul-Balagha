**About Preparing Provisions for the next World, While Being in this World, and Performing Good Deeds Before Death**

Perform \(good\) deeds while you are still in the vastness of this life, while the books are open \(for recording your deeds\), repentance is allowed, the runner away \(from Allah\) is being called upon \(to revert\) and the sinner is being given hope \(of forgiveness\) before the \(light of\) action is put off, before time expires, life ends, the door of repentance is closed and the angels ascend to the sky\.

Therefore, a man should derive benefit from himself for himself, from the living for the dead, from the mortal for the immortal, and from the who departs for the one who stays\. A man should fear Allah while he is given a life to lead up to his death and is given time to act\. A man should control himself by the rein and hold it with its bridle\. Thus, by the rein he should prevent it from disobedience towards Allah, and by the bridle he should lead it towards obedience to Allah\.
