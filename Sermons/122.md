**Address of Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) to His Followers on**

**the Battlefield of Siffin About Providing a Moral Support For the**

**Weak and the Low\-spirited During the Fighting :**

163This is a reference to either Mu\`awiyah or Amr ibn al\-As\.

<a id="page524"></a>Whoever among you feels spiritedness of heart during the action and finds any of his comrades feeling disheartened should ward off \(the enemies\) from him just as he will do from himself because of the superiority he enjoys over the other, for if Allah had willed He will have made the former also like him\. Certainly death is a quick seeker\. Neither does the steadfast escape it nor can the one who runs away defy it\. The best death is to be killed\. By Allah in Whose hand \(power\) lies the life of the son of Abu Talib, certainly a thousand strikes of the sword on me are easier to me than a death in bed which is not in obedience to Allah\.

**Part of the same sermon:**

It is as if I see you uttering voices like the rustling sound of lizards\! You do not seek your own claims nor do you defend against oppression\. You have been let free on the path\. He who rushes \(into the battle\) achieves salvation, while he who lags behind, hesitating, gets destruction\.
