**When Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) Was Told That the Kharijites Had Been Totally Killed, He Said the Following:**

142This prediction cannot be attributed to wit and far\- sightedness\. Far\-sighted eyes may forecast victory or defeat and preconceive the outcome of war but to tell about the actual figures of the killed on either side is beyond their capacity\. This can be done only by one who can unveil the unknown future and see the coming scene with his eyes and who sees the sketches yet to appear on the, p\. of the future with the help of the light of knowledge possessed by him as Imam\. Consequently, events occurred according to what this inheritor of Prophet’s knowledge had said and from among the Kharijites all except nine persons were killed\. Two of them fled to Oman, two to Sajistan, two to Kirman and two to Jazira while one escaped to Tall Mawzan \(Mawzan Hill\)\. Of Amir al\-Mu’minin’s party only eight men fell as martyrs\.
