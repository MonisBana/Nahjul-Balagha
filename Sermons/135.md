**About the Sincerity of His Own Intention and Support of the Oppressed**

164Al\-Mughirah ibn al\-Akhnas ath\-Thaqafi was among the well\-wishers of Othman ibn Affan and the son of his paternal aunt\. His brother Abul\-Hakam ibn al\-Akhnas was killed at the hands of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) in the battle of

Uhud because of which he bore malice against Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\. His

father was one of those people who accepted Islam at the time of fall of Mecca but retained heresy and hypocrisy in his heart\. That is why Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) called him accursed and he called him issueless because he who has a son like al\-Mughirah deserves to be called “issueless”\.

<a id="page550"></a>Your allegiance to me was not without thinking,165 nor is my and your status the same\. I seek you for Allah’s sake but you seek me for your own benefits\. O people\! support me despite your heart’s desires\. By Allah, I will take revenge for the oppressed from the oppressor and will put a string in the nose of the oppressor and drag him to the spring of truthfulness even though he may grudge it\.
