**Sermon 223**

**Supplication**

O Lord\! Preserve \(the grace of\) my face with easiness of life and do not disgrace my countenance with destitution lest I should have to beg a livelihood from those who beg from You, try to seek the favor of Your evil creatures, engage myself in praising those who give me and be tempted to abuse those who do not give to me, although behind all these You are the master of giving and denying\.

“Verily, You have power over all things, You are the all\-Powerful One” \(Holy Quran, 66: 8\)\.
