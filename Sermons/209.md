**Sermon 209**

**Someone1 Asked Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) about Concocted Traditions and Contradictory Sayings of the Prophet \(h\)**

**Which Were Then in Circulation among the Public\. The Imam Said the Following :**

Certainly, what is current among the people is both right and wrong, true and false, repealing and repealed, general and particular, definite and indefinite, exact and surmised\. Even during the Prophet’s days, false sayings had been attributed to him, so much so that he had to say during his sermon that “Whoever attributes falsehoods to me makes his own abode in Hell\.” Those who relate traditions are no more than four categories:

194This person was Sulaym ibn Qays al\-Hilali, one of the narrators of traditions through Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\.

<a id="page693"></a>**1\. The Lying Hypocrites**

The hypocrite is a person who makes a show of faith and adopts the appearance of a Muslim\. He does not hesitate to sin, nor does he keep aloof from vice\. He willfully attributes false things to the Messenger of Allah\. If people knew that he was a hypocrite and a liar, they would not accept anything from him and would not consider what he says\. Rather, they would say that he is the companion of the Prophet \(h\), has met him,

heard \(his statements\) and acquired knowledge from him\. They, therefore, accept what he says\. Allah, too, had warned you against the hypocrites and described them fully to you\. They have continued after the Holy Prophet \(h\)\. They gained positions with the leaders of misguidance and

callers towards Hell through falsehoods and slandering\. So, the latter put them in high positions and made them officers over the heads of the people, letting them amass wealth\. People are always with the rulers and after this world except those to whom Allah affords protection\. This is the first of the four categories\.

**2\. Those Who are Mistaken**

Then there is the individual who heard \(a saying\) from the Holy Prophet \(h\) but did not memorize it as it was, but surmised its gist\. He

does not lie willfully\. Now, he carries the saying with him and relates it, depends upon it and claims that: “I heard it from the Messenger of Allah\.” If the Muslims come to know that he has committed a mistake in it, they will not accept it from him, and if he himself knows that he is wrong, he will give it up\.

**3\. Those Who are Ignorant**

The third man is one who heard the Prophet \(h\) ordering to do something, and later the Prophet \(h\) forbade people from doing it, but this man did not know it, or he heard the Prophet \(h\) forbidding people

from doing something and later he allowed it, but this man did not know it\. In this case, he retained in his mind what had been repealed and did not retain the repealing tradition\. If he knew that it had been repealed, he would reject it, or if the Muslims knew, when they heard it from him, that it had been repealed, they would reject it\.

<a id="page694"></a>**4\. Those Who Accurately Memorize**

The last, namely the fourth man, is whoever does not speak a lie against Allah or against His Prophet \(h\)\. He hates falsehood out of fear

for Allah and respect for the Messenger of Allah and does not commit mistakes, but retains \(in his mind\) exactly what he heard \(from the Prophet \(h\)\) and he relates it as he heard it without adding anything or

omitting anything\. He heard the repealing tradition, he retained it and acted upon it and he heard the repealed tradition and rejected it\. He also understands the particular and the general and he knows the definite and indefinite and gives everything its due status\.

The sayings of the Prophet \(h\) used to be of two types\. One was

particular and the other common\. Sometimes a man would hear him but he would not know what Allah, the Glorified One, meant by it or what the Messenger of Allah meant by it\. In this way the listener carries it and memorizes it without knowing its meaning and its real intention, or what was its reason\. Among the companions of the Messenger of Allah all were not in the habit of putting him questions and ask him the meanings, indeed they always wished that some Bedouin or stranger might come and ask him \(x\) so that they would also listen\. Whenever any such thing came

before me, I asked him about its meaning and preserved it\. These are the reasons and grounds of differences among the people in their traditions\.

In this sermon, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has divided the traditionists into four categories:\.

The first category is that of a man who concocts a tradition then attributes it to the Prophet \(h\)\. Traditions were in fact falsified and

attributed to him even during his holy life\-time\. This process continued with the result that numerous fabricated traditions came into existence\. This is a fact which cannot be denied, but if anyone does deny it, his basis would not be knowledge, or sagacity by oratory, or argumentative necessity\. Thus, once, “alamul\-huda” \(the ensign of guidance\), namely Sayyid al\-Murtada, had a chance to meet some Sunni ulema’ \(scholars\) with whom he made a debate\. During that incident, Sayyid al\-Murtada proved by citing historical facts that the traditions related about the merits of the “great companions” \(or the “righteous caliphs”\) were concocted and fabricated\. On this, the \(Sunni\) ulema’ argued that it was impossible that someone should dare to speak a lie against the Prophet \(h\) and make

<a id="page695"></a>up a tradition by himself then attribute it to the Prophet \(k\)\. Sayyid al\-

Murthada said that there was a tradition of the Prophet \(h\) that:

“Many false things will be attributed to me after my death; whoever speaks a lie against me will be preparing his own abode in Hell” \(al\-Bukhari, Vol\. 1, p\. 38; Vol\. 2, p\. 102; Vol\. 4, p\. 207; Vol\. 8, p\. 54; Muslim, Vol\. 8, p\. 229; Abu Dawud, Vol\. 3, pp\. 319\-320; al \-Tirmidhi, Vol\. 4, p\. 524; Vol\. 5, pp\. 35\-36, 40, 199, 634; Ibn Majah, Vol\. 1, pp\. 13\-15\)\.

If you regard this tradition as true, then you should agree that false things have, indeed, been attributed to the Prophet \(h\)\. But if you

regard it as false, this would still prove our point\. However, these were people whose hearts were full of hypocrisy and who used to make up traditions of their own in order to create mischief and dispersion in religion and to misguide the Muslims of weak convictions\. Such fabricators kept thus fabricating “traditions” just as they used to do during the lifetime of the Prophet \(h\) just as they remained busy in their

activities of mischief and destruction in those days\. They were not unmindful of altering the teachings of Islam and metamorphosing its saline features\. Rather, in the days of the Prophet \(h\), they were always afraid lest he should expose them and put them to shame\. But after the demise of the Prophet \(h\), their hypocritical activities increased, and

they attributed false things to the Prophet \(h\) without demur for their own personal ends\. Those who heard them believed in them because of their status as companions of the Prophet \(h\), thinking that whatever

they said was correct and whatever they gave out was true\. Afterwards, the belief that all the companions are correct put a stopper on their tongues, as a result of which they were taken to be above criticism, questioning, discussion and censure\. Besides, their conspicuous performance had made them prominent in the eyes of the government\. Also because of this, the government lacked the courage to speak against them\. This is proven by Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s words: “These people gained positions with the leaders of misguidance and callers towards Hell, through falsehood and slandering\. So, they put them in high positions and made them officers over the heads of the people\.”

Along with the destruction of Islam, the hypocrites also aimed at amassing wealth\. They were doing so claiming to be Muslims because of which they did not want to remove the veil of Islam \(from their faces\) and to come out openly\. They wanted to continue their Satanic activities under

<a id="page696"></a>the garb of Islam, engaging themselves in its basic destruction, spreading division and dissension by concocting false “traditions”\. In this regard, Ibn Abul \-Hadid has written the following: “When they were left free, they, too, left many things\. When people remained silent about them, they also remained silent about Islam\. But they continued their underground activities such as the fabrication of falsehoods to which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has alluded\. Many untrue matters had been mixed with the

traditions by the same group of people of wrong beliefs who aimed at misguidance and the distortion of views and beliefs, while some of them also aimed at extolling some particular party with whom they had other worldly aims as well\.”

On the expiration of this period, when Mu\`awiyah took over the leadership of the religion and occupied the throne of temporal authority, he opened an official department for the fabrication of “traditions”, ordering his officers to fabricate and popularize traditions in disparagement of Ahl al\-Bayt \(x\) \(the Household of the Holy Prophet

\[h\]\), extol Othman and the Umayyads, and announcing generous

rewards and land grants for this work\. Consequently, a lot of traditions about self\-made distinctions gained entry in the books of traditions\. Thus, Abul\-Hassan al\- Mada’ini has written in his book Kitab al\- ahadith which Ibn Abul \-Hadid has quoted as follows: “Mu\`awiyah wrote to his officers that they should take special care of those who were followers of Othman, his well\-wishers and lovers and to award high status, precedence and honor to those who related traditions about his merits and distinctions,and to convey to him whatever is thus related by any person, along with his name, the name of his father and the name of his tribe\. They did accordingly and heaped up traditions about the merits and distinctions of Othman because Mu\`awiyah used to award them rewards, clothes, grants and lands\.”

When the fabricated traditions about the merits of Othman had been disseminated throughout the Islamic lands, with the idea that the status of the earlier Caliphs should not remain low, Mu\`awiyah wrote the following to his officers: “As soon as you receive this order of mine, you should call upon the people to make up traditions about the distinctions of the companions and other caliphs, too\. Make sure that if any Muslim relates any tradition in praise of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), you should

make up a similar tradition about the companions to contradict it because this gives me great pleasure and cools my eyes and it weakens the status of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib and his party and is more severe to them than the merits and distinctions of Othman\. When his letters were read to the

<a id="page697"></a>people, a large number of such traditions were related extolling the companions that are all fabricated with no truth at all” \(Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 11, pp\. 43\-47\)\.

In this regard, “Abu Abdillah”, namely Ibrahm ibn Muhammad ibn Arafah, famous as Niftawayh \(244/858 \- 323/935\), was one of the prominent scholars and traditionists who have written about this subject\. Ibn Abul \-Hadid has quoted him saying, “Most false traditions about the merits of the companions were fabricated during the days of Mu\`awiyah in order to gain status in his audience because his view was that in this way he could disgrace Banu Hashim and render their status low” \(Ibid\.\)\.

After that, fabrication of traditions became a good paying job for many\. The seekers of this world made it a means of securing status with their contemporary kings and nobles and to amass wealth\. For example, Ghiyath ibn Ibrahim an\-Nakh\`i \(2nd cent\. A\.H\.\) fabricated a tradition about the flight of pigeons in order to please al\-Mahdi ibn al\-Mansur \(the Abbasid caliph\) and to secure a status near to him \(Tarikh Baghdad, Vol\. 12, pp\. 323\-327; Mizan al \-I’tidal, Vol\. 3, pp\.337\-338; Lisan al\-Mizan, Vol\. 4, p\.422\)\. Abu Sa’id al\-Mada’ini and others made it a means of livelihood\. The maximum limit was reached when al\-Karramiyya and some of the al\-Mutasawwifah gave the ruling that the fabrication of traditions for the prevention of sin or for persuasion towards obedience was lawful\. Consequently, with regard to persuading and dissuading, traditions were fabricated quite freely, and this was not regarded as being against the religious law or in contradiction with morality\. Rather, this work was generally done by those who bore the appearance of asceticism or fear of Allah and who passed their nights in praying and days in filling their books with false traditions\. An idea about the number of these fabricated traditions can be formulated from the fact that out of six hundred thousand traditions, al\-Bukhari selected only two thousand and seven hundred and sixty\-one traditions \(Tarikh Baghdad, Vol\. 2, p\.8; Al\-Irshad as\-Sari, Vol\. 1, p\.28; Sifatul\- Safwah, Vol\. 4, p\. 143\)\. Muslim regarded for selection in his book only four thousand out of three hundred thousand traditions \(Tarikh Baghdad, Vol\. 13, p\. 101; Al\-Muntzam, Vol\. 5, p\.32; Tabaqat al\-Huffaz, Vol\. 2, pp\. 151, 157; Wafiyyat al\-A’yan, Vol\. 5, p\. 194\)\. Abu Dawud took four thousand and eight hundred out of five hundred thousand \(Tarikh Baghdad, Vol\. 9, p\. 57; Tabaqat al\-Huffaz, Vol\. 2, p\. 154; Al\-Muntazam, Vol\. 5, p\. 97; Wafiyyat al \-A’yan, Vol\. 2, p\. 404\) and Ahmed ibn Hanbal took thirty thousand out of nearly one million traditions \(Tarikh Baghdad, Vol\. 4, p\. 419\-420; Tabaqat al\-Huffaz, Vol\. 2,

1. 17; Wafiyyat al\-A’yan, Vol\. 1, p\. 64; Tahthib al\-Tahthib, Vol\. 1, p\. 74\)\. But when this selection is studied, some traditions which come across

<a id="page698"></a>can, in no circumstances, be attributed to the Prophet \(h\)\. The result is

that a group of considerable number has cropped up among Muslims who, in view of these so\-called authoritative collections and true traditions, completely reject the evidentiary value of the traditions, \(For further reference see al\-Ghadr, Vol\. 5, pp\. 208\-378\)\.

The second category of narrators of traditions are those who, without appreciating the occasion or context, related whatever they could recollect, right or wrong\. Thus, in al\-Bukhari \(Vol\. 2, pp\. 100\-102; Vol\. 5,

1. 98\); Muslim \(Vol\. 3, pp\. 41\-45\); al\-Tirmidhi \(Vol\. 3, pp\. 327\-329\); al\-Nisa’i \(Vol\. 4, p\. 18\); Ibn Majah \(Vol\. 1, pp\. 508\-509\); Malik ibn Anas \(Al\-Muwatta’, Vol\. 1, p\. 234\); ash\-Shafi’i \(Ikhtilaful\-Hadith, on the side lines of Al\-Umm, Vol\. 7, p\. 266\); Abu Dawud \(Vol\. 3, p\. 194\); Ahmed ibn Hanbal \(Vol\. 1, pp\. 41, 42\) and al\-Baqyhaqi \(Vol\. 4, pp\. 72\-74\) in the chapter entitled ‘weeping over the dead’ it is stated that when \`Umar was wounded Suhayb came weeping to him, then Umar said the following: “O Suhayb\! If you weep mourn me, the Prophet \(h\) had said that the dead person is punished if his people mourn him\.”

After the death of Umar, this dialogue was mentioned to Aisha\. She said the following: “May Allah have mercy on \`Umar\! The Messenger of Allah did not say that mourning relatives brings about a punishment on the dead, but he said that the punishment of an unbeliever increases if people mourn him\.” After this, Aisha said that according to the Holy Quran, nobody had to bear the burden of another; so, how could the burden of those who weep be placed on the dead? After this, the following verse was quoted by Aisha: “No bearer of a burden shall bear the burden of another” \(Holy Quran, 6: 164; 17: 15; 35: 18; 39: 7; 53: 38\)\.

The wife of the Holy Prophet \(h\), Aisha, relates that once the Prophet \(h\) passed by a Jewish woman on account of whose death her people were weeping\. The Prophet \(h\) then remarked, “Her people are weeping over her, but she is undergoing punishment in the grave\.”

The third category of the narrators of traditions is that of those who heard some repealed traditions from the Prophet \(h\) but could not

get any change to hear the repealing traditions which he could relate to others\. An example of a repealing tradition is the statement of the Prophet \(h\) which also contains a reference to the repealed tradition, namely: “I

had prohibited you from visiting graves, but now you can visit them” \(Muslim, Vol\. 3, p\. 65; al\-Tirmidhi, Vol\. 3, p\. 370; Abu Dawud, Vol\. 3,

<a id="page699"></a>1. 218, 332; al\-Nisa’i, Vol\. 4, p\. 89; Ibn Majah, Vol\. 1, pp\. 500\-501; Malik ibn Anas, Vol\. 2, p\. 485; Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Vol\. 1, pp\. 145,452; Vol\. 3, pp\. 38, 63, 66, 237, 350; Vol\. 5, pp\. 350, 355, 356, 357, 359, 361; al\-Hakim, Al\-Mustadrak, Vol\. 1, pp\. 374\-376, and al\-Bayhaqi, Vol\. 4, pp\. 76\-77\)\. Herein, the permission to visit graves has repealed the previous restriction\. Now, those who heard only the repealed tradition continued acting according to it\.

The fourth category of narrators of traditions is that of those who were fully aware of the principles of justice, possessed intelligence and sagacity, knew the occasion when a tradition was first uttered \(by the Prophet \[h\]\) and were also acquainted with the repealing and the

repealed traditions, the particular and the general, and the temporary and the permanent\. They avoided falsehood and fabrication\. Whatever they heard remained preserved in their memory, and they conveyed it with exactness to others\. It is they whose traditions are the precious wealth of Islam, free from fraud and counterfeit, worthy of being trusted and acted upon\. That collection of traditions, which has been conveyed through trustworthy bosoms like that of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and has

remained free from cutting, curtailing, alteration, present Islam in its true form\. The status of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) in Islamic knowledge has been most certainly proved through traditions narrated from the Holy Prophet \(h\) such as:\.

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), Jabir ibn \`Abdullah, Ibn \`Abbas and Abdullah ibn \`Umar have narrated from the Holy Prophet \(h\) that he

said the following: “I am the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate\. Whoever wants to acquire \(my\) knowledge should come through its gate \(Al\-Mustadrak, Vol\. 3, pp\. 126\-127; Al\-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 3, p\. 1102; Usd al\-Ghaba, Vol\. 4, p\. 22; Tarikh Baghdad, Vol\. 2, p\. 377; Vol\. 4, p\. 348; Vol\. 7, p\. 172; Vol\. 11, pp\. 48\-50; Tadhkirah al\-Huffaz, Vol\. 4, p\. 28; Majma’ al\-Zawa’id, Vol\. 9, p\. 114; Tahthib al\-Tahthib, Vol\. 6, p\. 320; Vol\. 7, p\. 337; Lisan al\-Mizan, Vol\. 2, pp\. 122\-123; Tarikh al\-Khulafa’, p\. 170; Kanz al\-Ummal, Vol\. 6, pp\. 152, 156, 401; \`Umdat al\-Qari, Vol\. 7, p\. 631; Sharh al\-Mawahib al\-Laduniyya, Vol\. 3, p\. 143\)\.

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and ibn Abbas have also cited the Holy Prophet \(h\) saying, “I am the store\-house of wisdom and Ali is its

door\. Whoever wants to acquire wisdom should come through its door” \(Hilyat al\-Awliya’, Vol\. 1, p\. 64; Masabih as\-Sunna, Vol\. 2, p\. 275;

<a id="page700"></a>Tarikh Baghdad, Vol\. 11, p\. 204; Kanz al\-Ummal, Vol\. 6, p\. 401; Al\-Riyad al\-Nadara, Vol\. 12, p\. 193\)\.

If only people could take the Prophet’s blessings through these sources of knowledge\! But it is a tragic chapter of history that although traditions are accepted through the Kharijites and enemies of the Prophet’s family, whenever the series of relaters includes the name of any individual from among the Prophet’s family, there is hesitation in accepting that tradition\.\.\.\!
