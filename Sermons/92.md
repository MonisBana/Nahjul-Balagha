**About the Annihilation of the Kharijites, Themischief Mongering of Umayyads and the Vastness of His Knowledge:**

So now, Praise and Glorification belong to Allah\. O people\! I have put out the eye of rebellion\. No one except me advanced towards it when its gloom was swelling and its madness was intense\. Ask me before

152Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) delivered this sermon after the battle of

Nahrawan\. In it, “mischiefs” implicitly refers to the battles fought in Basra, Siffin and Nahrawan because their nature was different from the battles of the Prophet \(h\)\. There the opposite party was the unbelievers while here the confrontation

was with those who had veils of Islam on their faces\. So people were hesitant to fight against Muslims and said why they should fight with those who recited the call to the prayers and offered the prayers\. Thus, Khuzaymah ibn Thabit al\-Ansari did not take part in the Battle of Siffin till the falling of Ammar ibn Yasir as martyr did not prove the opposite party was rebellious\. Similarly the presence of companions like Talhah and az\-Zubayr who were included in the Foretold Ten on the side of Aisha in Basra and the prayer signs on foreheads of the Kharijites in Nahrawan and their prayers and worships were creating confusion in the minds\. In these circumstances only those could have the courage to rise against them were aware of the secrets of their hearts and the reality of their faith\. It was the peculiar perception of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and his spiritual courage

that he rose to oppose them and testified to the saying of the Holy Prophet \(h\):

“You will fight after me with the breakers of allegiance \(people of Jamal\), oppressors \(people of Syria\) and deviators \(the Kharijites\) as we read in the following references*: “Al\-Mustadrak Ala as\-Sahihayn*, al\-Hakim, Vol\. 3, pp\.139\-40; _Al\-Durr al\-Manthur_, Vol6, p\.18; _Al\-Isti\`ab_, Vol\. 3, p\.1117; _Usd al\-Ghaba_, Vol\. 4 pp\.32, 33; _Tarikh Baghdad_, Vol\. 8, p\.340; Vol\. 13, p\. 186, 187; _Tarikh,_ _Ibn Asakir_, Vol\. 5, p\. 41;_ Tarikh Ibn Kathar_, Vol\. 7, pp\. 304\-6;_ Majma\` az\-Zawa’id_, Vol\. 7, p\. 238; Vol\. 9, p\. 235;_ Sharh al\-Mawahib_, Vol\. 3, pp\. 316\-317;_ Kanz al\-Ummal_, Vol\. 6, pp\.72,82,88,155,319,391,392; Vol\. 8, p\.215\.

<a id="page488"></a>you miss me,153 because, by Allah, who has my life in His hands, if you ask me anything between now and the Day of Judgement or about the group who will guide a hundred people and also misguide a hundred people, I will tell you who is announcing its march, who is driving it in the front and who is driving it at the rear, the stages where its riding animals will stop for rest and the final place of stay and who among them will be killed and who will die a natural death\.

When I am dead hard circumstances and distressing events will befall you\. Many persons in the status of asking questions will remain silent with eyes cast down while those in the status of replying will lose courage\. This will be at a time when wars will descend upon you with all hardship and days will be so hard on you that you will feel them prolonged because of hardship till Allah will give victory to those remaining virtuous among you\.

153After the Holy Prophet \(h\) no one except Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) could

utter the challenge\. Ask whatever you want to\. ibn Abdul\-Barr in Jami Bayan al\-Ilm wa fadlihi, Vol\. 1, p\.58 and in _Al\-Isti\`ab_, Vol\. 3, p\.1103; Ibn al\-Athi

1. in _Usd al\-Ghaba_, Vol\. 4, p\.22; Ibn Abul\-Hadid in _Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha_, Vol7, p\. 46; as\-Sayyuti in _Tarikh al\-Khulafa’_, p\.171 and ibn Hajar al\-Haytami in _Al\-Sawa’iq al\-Muhriqa_, p\.76 have written that “None among the companions of the\* \*Holy Prophet \(h\) ever said, ‘Ask me whatever you want’ except Ali ibn Abu

Talib\.” However, among other than the companions a few names do appear in history who did utter such a challenge, such as Ibrahim ibn Hisham al\-Makhzumi, Muqatil ibn Sulayman, Qaradah ibn Di’amah, Abd ar\-Rahman \(Ibn al\-Jawzi\) and Muhammad ibn Idris ash\-Shafi’i etc\. but everyone of them faced disgrace and was forced to take back his challenge\. This challenge can be urged only by him who knew the realities of the universe and is aware of the happenings of the future\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) the opener of the door of

the Prophet’s knowledge as he was, was the only person who was never seen being unable to answer any question on any occasion\. This was so much so that even \`Umar had to say that AI seek Allah’s protection from the difficulty for the solution of which Ali will not be available\. Similarly, the prophesies of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) made about the future proved true word\-for\-word and served as

an index to his vast knowledge, whether they be about the devastation of Banu Umayyah, of the risings of the Kharijites, the wars and destruction by the Tatars, of the attacks of the English, the floods of Basra and the ruination of Kufa\. In short when these events are historical realities there is no reason why this challenge of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) should be wondered at\.

<a id="page489"></a>When mischief comes they confuse \(right with wrong\) and when they clear away they leave a warning\. They cannot be known at the time of approach but are recognized at the time of return\. They blow like the blowing of winds, striking some cities and missing others\.

Beware that the worst mischief for you in my view is the mischief of Banu Umayyah because it is blind and also creates darkness\. Its sway is general but its ill effects are for particular people\. He who remains clear\-sighted in it will be affected by distress and he who remains blind in it will avoid the distress\. By Allah, after me you will find Banu Ummayyah the very worst for yourselves, like the old unruly she\-camel who bites with its mouth, beats with its fore\-legs, kicks with its hind legs and refuses to be milked\. They will remain over you till they will leave among you only those who benefit them or those who do not harm them\. Their calamity will continue till your seeking help from them will become like the seeking of help by the slave from his master or of the follower from the leader\.

Their mischief will come to you like evil\-eyed fear and pre\-Islamic fragments, wherein there will be no minaret of guidance nor any sign \(of salvation\) to be seen\. We Ahl al\-Bayt \(x\) \(the Household of the

Prophet \(h\)\) are free from this mischief and we are not among those who

will engender it\. Thereafter, Allah will dispel it from you like the removal of the skin \(from flesh\) through him who will humble them, drag them by their necks, make them drink full cups \(of hardships\), not extend to them anything but sword and not clothe them except with fear\. At that time Quraish will wish at the cost of the world and all its contents to find me even only once and just for the duration of the slaughter of a camel in order that I may accept from them \(the whole of\) that of which at present\. I am asking them only a part but they are not giving me\.
