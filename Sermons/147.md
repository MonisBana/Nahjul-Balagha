**About Talhah and az\-Zubayr and the People of Basra**

Both of these men \(Talhah and az\- Zubayr\) wish the Caliphate for himself and is drawing towards himself as against the other fellow\. They do not employ any connection for getting access to Allah nor proceed towards Him through any means\. Both of them bear malice against the other\. Shortly his veil over it will be uncovered\. But Allah, if they achieve what they aim at, one of them will kill the other and one will finish the other\. The rebellious party has stood u, p\. Where are the seekers of virtue; for the paths have already been determined and they have been given thenews\. For every misguidance there is a cause and for every break of pledge there is a misrepresentation\. By Allah, I shall not be like him who listens to the voice of mourning, hears the man who brings news of death and also visits themourner yet does not take lesson\.
