**Sermon 177**

**Praising Allah, Transience of this World and Causes of the Decline of Allah’s Blessings \(Delivered at the Beginning of His Caliphate after the Killing of Othman\) **\.

One condition does not prevent Him from \(getting into\) another condition, time does not change Him, place does not locate Him and the tongue cannot describe Him\. The number of drops of water, of stars in the sky, or of currents of winds in the air, are not unknown to Him, nor are the movements of ants on rocks, or the resting places of grubs in the dark night\. He knows the places where leaves fall and the secret movements of the eyes\.

I testify that there is no god but Allah Who has no equal, Who is not doubted, Whose religion is not denied and Whose creativeness is not questioned\. My testimony is like that of a man whose intention is free, whose conscience is clear, whose belief is pure and whose scales \(of good deeds\) are heavy\. I also testify that Muhammad \(h\) is His servant and

Messenger, the chosen one from among His creations, the one selected for explaining His realities, chosen for His honors and to convey His sacred messages\. Through him, the signs of guidance have been lit and the gloom of blindness \(misguidance\) has been dispelled\.

O people\! Surely this world deceives him who yearns for it and who is attracted to it\. It does not behave niggardly with him who aspires for it and overpowers him who overpowers it\. By Allah, no people are deprived of the lively pleasures of life after having enjoyed them except as a result of sins committed by them because certainly Allah is not unjust to His creatures\. Even then, when calamities descend upon people and pleasures depart from them, they turn towards Allah with a true intention and the feeling in their hearts that He will return to them everything that has fled away from them, that He will cure all their ills\.

<a id="page616"></a>I fear about you lest you should fall into ignorance \(that prevailed before the mission of the Prophet \[h\]\)\. In the past, there were certain

matters in which you were deflected, and in my view, you were not worthy of admiration\. But if your previous status could be returned to you, then you will become virtuous\. I can only strive; but if I were to speak, I will \(only\) say: May Allah forgive your past actions\.
