**There was some exchange of words between Othman ibn Affan and Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) when al\-Mughirah ibn al\-Akhnas1 said to Othman that he will deal with Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) on his behalf whereupon Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said to al\-Mughirah:**

O son of the accursed and issueless and of a tree which has neither root nor branch\. Will you deal with me? By Allah, Allah will not grant victory to him whom you support, nor will he be able to stand up whom you raise\. Get away from us\. Allah may keep you away from your purpose\. Then do whatever you like\. Allah may not have mercy on you if you have pity on me\.
