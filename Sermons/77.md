**Supplications by Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\):**

O Lord\! Forgive what You know about me more than I do\. If I return \(to the sins\) You return to forgiveness\. My Allah forgive me for

<a id="page451"></a>what I had promised to myself but You did not find its fulfillment with me\. My Allah forgive me with what I sought nearness to You with my tongue but my heart opposed and did not perform it\. My Allah forgive my winking of the eye, vile utterances, desires of the heart and errors of speech\.
