**Sermon 161**

**One of the companions of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) \(from**

**Banu Asad\) asked him: “How was it that your tribe \(Quraish\) deprived you of this status \(Caliphate\) although you deserved it most?” In his reply, the Imam said the following **:

O brother of Banu Asad\! Your girth is loose and you have put it on the wrong way\. Nevertheless, you enjoy in \-law kinship and also the right to ask\. Since you have asked, listen\. As regarding the oppression against us in this matter, although we were the highest in descent and the strongest in kinship to the Messenger of Allah, it was a selfish act over which the hearts of people became greedy, although some people did not care for it\. The Arbiter is Allah and to Him is the return on the Day of Judgement\.

Now1 leave alone this story of devastation about which there is hue and cry all around\.

Come and look at the son of Abu Sufyan \(Mu\`awiyah\) \. Time has made me laugh after weeping\. No wonder, by Allah; what is this affair which surpasses all wonder and which has increased wrongfulness? These people have tried to put out the flame of Allah’s light from His lamp and close His fountain from its source\. They mixed epidemic\-producing water between them and myself\. If the trying hardships were removed from us, I will take them on the course of truthfulness otherwise:

So let not thy self go \(in vain\) in grief for them; verily Allah knows all that they do\. \(Holy Quran, 35: 8\)

Here is an excerpt from a couplet by the famous Arab poet

Imri’ul\-Qays al\-Kindi:

\.\.\. And let me know the story of

What happened to the riding camels\!

The incident behind this couplet is that when the father of Imri’ul\-Qays, namely Hijr ibn al\-Harith, was killed, the poet roamed about the various Arab tribes to solicit their help to avenge his father’s murder\. During this endeavor, he stayed with a man of Jadilah tribe, but finding himself unsafe, he left that place and stayed with Khalid ibn Sadus an\-Nabhani\. In the meantime, a man of Jadilah named Ba’ith ibn

<a id="page587"></a>Huways took away with some of the poet’s camels\. Imri’ul\-Qays complained of this matter to his host, asking him to send with him his she\-camels, then he would get back his own\. Consequently, Khalid went to those people and asked them to return the camels of his guest which they had stolen\. They said that the poet was neither a guest \[of theirs\] nor under his \[host’s\] protection\. Thereupon, Khalid swore that the poet was really his guest, showing them his she\-camels that he had with him\. They then agreed to return the camels\. But actually instead of returning the camels, they drove away the she\-camels as well173\.

Another version of this incident is that they did return the camels to Khalid, but instead of handing them over to Imri’ul\-Qays, the host kept them for himself\. When Imri’ul\-Qays came to know this, he composed a few couplets out of which this is one\. It means “Now you leave the story of these camels which were stolen but just let me know about the she\-camels snatched from my own hands\!”

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s intention in quoting this poetry verse, as an illustration, is that “Now that Mu\`awiyah is at war, we should talk about it and leave the discussion about the devastation generated by those who had usurped my rights\. That time \[of the first calamity\] has gone away\. Now is the time for grappling with the mischief of the hour\. So discuss the event of the moment and do not start an untimely strain\.” Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said this because the man had put the

question to him at the time of the Battle of Siffin, when the battle was raging and bloodshed was in full swing\.
