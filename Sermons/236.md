**About the Two Arbitrators \(Abu Musa al\-Ash\`ari and Amr Ibn Al\-As\) and the Disparagement of the Syrians\.**

Rude, low people and mean slaves\! They have been collected from all sides and picked up from every pack\. They need to be taught the tenets \(of Islam\), disciplined, instructed, trained, supervised and led by the hand\. They are neither Muhajirun nor Ansar, nor are those who made their dwellings in the abode \(in Medina\) and in belief\.

Look\! They have chosen for themselves one who is nearest of all to what they desire, while you have chosen one who is nearest to what you dislike\. You may certainly recall that the other day Abdullah ibn Qays \(Abu Musa al\-Ash\`ari\) was saying, “It is mischief; therefore, cut

<a id="page731"></a>away your bow\-string and sheathe your swords\.” If he was right \(in what he said\), then he was wrong in marching \(against us\) without being forced\. But if he was lying, then he should be viewed with suspicion\. Therefore, send \`Abdullah ibn Abbas to face \`Amr ibn al\-As\. Make use of these days and safeguard the borders of Islam\. Do you not see that your cities are being attacked and your prowess is being aimed at?
