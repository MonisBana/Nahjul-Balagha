**About the Methods of Preaching and Counseling**

O people\! Abstinence is to shorten desires, to be thankful for bounties and to keep from prohibitions\. If this is possible then \(at least\) the prohibitions should not overpower your patience\. Allah has exhausted the excuse before you through clear, shining arguments and open, bright books\.
