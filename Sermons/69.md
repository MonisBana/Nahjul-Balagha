**Sermon 69**

**Delivered in the Morning of the Day When Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Was Fatally Struck with a Sword’s Blow:**

I was sitting when sleep overtook me\. I saw the Prophet of Allah \(k\) appear before me and I said, “O Prophet of Allah \(k\)\! what crookedness and animosity I had to face from the people\.” The Prophet of Allah \(k\) said the following: “Invoke \(Allah\) evil upon them, but I said,

“Allah may change them for me with better ones and change me for them with a worse one\.”

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “Al\-awad means crookedness and al\-ladad means animosity; this is a most eloquent expression\.”
