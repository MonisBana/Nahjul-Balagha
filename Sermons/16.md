**Sermon 16**

**Delivered When Allegiance Was Sworn to Him at Medina**

The responsibility for what I say is guaranteed and I am answerable for it\. He to whom experiences have clearly shown the past exemplary punishments \(given by Allah to people\) is prevented by piety from falling into doubts\. You should know that the same troubles have returned to you which existed when the Prophet \(h\) was first sent\.

By Allah Who sent the Prophet \(h\) with faith and truth\! You

will be severely subverted, bitterly shaken s in sieving and fully mixed as by spooning in a cooking pot till your low persons become high and high ones become low, those who were behind would attain forward positions and those who were forward would become backward\. By Allah, I have not concealed a single word or spoken any lie and I had been informed of this event and of this time\.

Beware that sins are like unruly horses on whom their riders have been placed and their reins have been let loose so that they would jump

<a id="page377"></a>with them in Hell\. Beware that piety is like trained horses on whom the riders have been placed with the reins in the hands so that they would take the riders to Heaven\. There is right and wrong and there are followers for each\. If wrong dominates, it has \(always\) in the past been so and if truth goes down that too has often occurred\. It seldom happens that a thing that lags behind comes forward\.

Ash\-Sharif ar\-Radi says the following by way of commenting on the above: “In the short speech, there is more beauty than can be appreciated and the quantity of amazement aroused by it is more than can be appreciated\. Despite what we have stated, it has so many aspects of eloquence that cannot be expressed, nor can anyone reach its depth\. And no one can understand what I am saying unless one has attained this are and known its details\.”

No one appreciates it except those who know \(Holy Quran, 29: 43\)

**From the Same Sermon:**

He who has heaven and hell in his view has no other aim\. He who attempts and acts quickly succeeds, while the seeker who is slow may also entertain hope\. And he who falls short of actions faces destruction in Hell\. On the right and left there are misleading paths\. Only the middle way if the \(right\) path which is the Everlasting book and the traditions of the Prophet \(h\)\. From it the Sunnah has spread out and toward it is the

eventual return\.

He who claims \(otherwise\) is ruined and he who concocts falsehood is disappointed\. He who opposes1 the right with his face gets destruction\. It is enough ignorance for a man not to know himself\. He who is strong rooted2 in piety does not get destruction and the plantation of the people based on piety never remains without water\. Hide yourselves in your houses and reform yourselves\. Repentance is at your back\. One should praise only Allah and condemn only his own self\.

In some versions of this same sermon, after the words man abda safhatahu lilhaqqi halaka, the words inda jahalatu’n\-nas also occur\. In tat case, the meaning of this sentence would be that he who stands in the face of right dies in the estimation of the ignorant\.

Piety is the connotation of the heart and the mind being affected and impressed by the Divine Greatness and Gory\. As an effect of it, the spirit of man becomes full of the fear of Allah and its inevitable result is

<a id="page378"></a>that engrossment in worship and prayers increases\. It is impossible that the heart may be full of the Divine fear and there be no manifestation of it in actions and deeds\. And since worship and submission reform the heart and nurture the spirit, purity of heart increases with the increase of worship\. That is why in the Holy Quran, Ataqwa \(piety\) has been applied sometimes to fear, in the verse, Ittaqul\-laha haqqa tuqatihi \(worship Allah as He ought to be worshipped\) \(3: 102\)\. Taqwa implies worship and devotion, and in the verse wa yakhsha’l\- laha wa yattaqhi faullaika humul faizun \(24: 52\) taqwa implies purity of the spirit and cleanliness of the heart\.

In the traditions, taqwa has been assigned three degrees\. The first degree is that a man should follow the injunctions and keep aloof from prohibitions\. The second degree is that recommended matters should also be followed and disliked things should be avoided\. The third degree is that for fear of falling into doubts, one may abstain from the permissible as well\. The first degree is for the common men, the second for the nobles and the third for the high dignitaries\. Allah has referred to these three degrees in the following verse:

On those who believe and do good, is not blame for what they ate \(before\) when they did guard themselves and did believe and did good, still \(furthermore\) they guard themselves and do good, and Allah loves the doers of good\. \(Holy Quran, 5: 93\)

Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) says that only action based on piety is

lasting and only that action will blossom and bear fruit which is watered by piety because worship is only that wherein the feeling of submissiveness exists\. Thus, Allah says the following:

Is he, therefore, better who has laid his foundation on fear of Allah and \(His\) goodwill or he who lays his foundation on the brink of a crumbling bank so it broke down with him into the fire of hell?\(Holy Quran 9: 109\)

Consequently, every such belief as is not based on knowledge and conviction is like the edifice, erected without foundation, wherein there is no stability or firmness while every action that is without piety is like the plantation which withers because of not being watered\.
