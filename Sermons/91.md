**When People Decided to Swear Allegiance to Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib’s Hand after the Murder of Othman, He Said the Following:**

Leave me and seek someone else\. We are facing a matter which has \(several\) faces and colors, which neither hearts can stand nor intelligence can accept\. Clouds are hovering over the sky and faces are not discernable\. You should know that if I respond to you I would lead you as I know and would not care about whatever one may say or abuse\. If you leave me then I am the same as you are\. It is possible I would listen to and obey whomever you make in charge of your affairs\. I am better for you as a counselor than as chief\.

With the murder of Othman, the caliphate became vacant and Muslims began to look at Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) whose peaceful

conduct, adherence to principles and political acumen had been witnessed by them to a great extent during this long period\. Consequently they rushed to swear allegiance on his righteousness in much the same way a traveler who had lost his way, then finding it again rushes towards his destination, as the historian al\-Tabari \(in Tarikh, Vol\. 1, pp\. 3066, 3067, 3076\) records the following: “People thronged around Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and said, “We want to swear the oath of allegiance to you; you

can see what troubles have befallen Islam and how we are being tried with regard to the near in kin of the Prophet \(h\)\.”

<a id="page486"></a>But Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) declined to accede to their

request whereupon these people raised hue and cry and began to shout loudly, “O Abul\-Hassan\! Do you not witness the ruination of Islam or see the advancing flood of unruliness and mischief? Do you have no fear of Allah?\!” Even Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) showed no readiness to consent because he was noticing that the effects of the atmosphere that had come into being after the Prophet \(h\) had overcome hearts and

minds of the people\. Selfishness and lust for power had become rooted in them, their thinking had become affected by materialism and they had become habituated to treating government as the means for securing their ends\. Now they would like to materialize the Divine Caliphate too and play with it\. In these circumstances it would be impossible to change the mentalities or turn their direction of temperaments\. In addition to these ideas he had also seen the end in sight, that these people should have further time to think on it so that on frustration of their material ends hereafter they should not say that the allegiance had been sworn by them under a temporary expediency and timely thought and that nature \(rational\) thought had not been given to it, just as \`Omer’s idea was about the first caliphate, which appears from his statement that: “bu Bakr’s caliphate came into being without due thought, but Allah saved us from its mischief\. If anyone repeats such an affair, you should kill him, as stated in \\sect fs22 Sahih al\- Bukhari, Vol\. 8, pp\.210, 211; in Al\-Musnad of Imam Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Vol\. 1, p\.55; in al\- Tabari, Vol\. 1, p\.1822; in Ibn al\-Athir, Vol\. 2, p\.327; in Ibn Hisham, Vol\. 4, pp\.308\-309, and in Ibn Kathir, Vol\. 5, p\.246\.

In short, when their insistence increased beyond limits, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) delivered this sermon wherein he clarified that: If you

want me for your worldly ends, then I am not ready to serve as your instrument\. Leave me and select someone else who may fulfil your ends\. You have seen my past life that I am not prepared to follow anything except the Holy Quran and Sunnah and would not give up this principle for securing power\. If you select someone else I would pay regard to the laws of the state and the constitution as a peaceful citizen should do\. I have not at any stage tried to disrupt the collective existence of the Muslims by inciting rebellion\. The same will happen now\. Rather, just as keeping the common good in view I have hitherto been giving correct advice, I will not grudge doing the same\. If you put me in the same status, it will be better for your worldly ends because in that case I will not have power in my hands so that I could stand in the way of your worldly affairs and create impediment against your heart’s wishes\. However, if you are determined to swear the oath of allegiance to me, then bear in mind that if

<a id="page487"></a>you frown or speak against me, I will force you to tread on the path of right and in the matter of the right I will not care for anyone\. If you want to swear the oath of allegiance even at this, you can satisfy your wish\.”

The impression Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had formed about

those people is fully corroborated by later events\. Consequently, when those who had sworn allegiance with worldly motives did not succeed in their objectives they broke away and rose against his government with baseless allegations\.
