**Sermon 120**

**A man from among the companions of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib stood up and said, “O Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\! You first**

**stopped us from the arbitration, then you gave order for it\. We do not know which of the two was more appropriate?”Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) struck one hand over the other and said the following :**

Such is the reward of one who breaks a pledge\. By Allah\! When I gave you my orders \(namely\) to abide by arbitration I had led you to an undesirable thing \(namely war\) in which Allah had ordained good\. If you had been steadfast I will have guided you, if you had been bent I will have straightened you and if you had refused I will have rectified you\. This was the surest way\. But with whom and through whom? I wanted my treatment from you but you proved to be my disease, like the one who extracts a thorn with another thorn when he knows that the thorn bends toward itself\.

Lord\! The physicians have despaired of this fatal ailment and water\-drawers have become tired with the rope of this well\. Where162 are those who were invited to Islam and they accepted it? they read the Holy Quran and decided according to it\. They were exhorted to fight and they

162Although all those who fought under the banner of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) were called Shi\`as of Ali, yet only those who had tears in their eyes,

paleness on their faces, the Quranic verses on their tongues, zeal of religion in their hearts, steadfastness in their feet, determination and courage in their spirits and patience and endurance in their minds could in true sense be called Shi\`as of Ali\. These were the people in whose separation Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s feelings were coming out in the shape of sighs through the breath, while the flames of the fire of separation were consuming his heart and spirit\. These were the people who leapt towards death like mad men and did not feel happy if they survived\. Rather, their heart’s slogan was as the Persian hemistich says the following: “We are ashamed why we have remained alive\.”He who has even a slight brilliance of these qualities can alone be called the follower of the Descendants of the Prophet \(h\) of the Shi\`a of Ali; otherwise, it will be a word which has lost its meaning and

been bereft of its dignity through misuse\. Thus tradition has it that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) saw a group of men at his door and inquired from Qanbar who they were and he answered they were his Shi\`as\. On hearing this Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had a frown on his forehead and said, “Why are they called Shi\`as? they have no sign of Shi\`as\. Thereupon, Qanbar inquired as to what were the signs of Shi\`as and Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) replied: “Their bellies are thin through hunger, their lips dry through thirst and their eyes bleared through weeping\.”

<a id="page522"></a>leapt \(toward it\) as she\-camels leap towards their young\. They took their swords out of the sheaths and went out into the world in groups and rows\. Some of them perished and some survived\. The good news of survival does not please them nor do they get condoled about the dead\. Their eyes have turned white with weeping\. Their bellies are emaciated because of fasting\. Their lips are dry because of \(constant\) praying\. Their color is pale because of wakefulness\. Their faces bear the dust of God\-fearing\. These are my comrades who have departed\. We should be justified if we feel eager for them and bite our hands in their separation\.

Certainly, Satan has made his ways easy for you and wants to unfasten the knots of religion one by one and to cause division among you in place of unity\. Keep away from his evil ideas and enchantments and accept good advice of one who offers it to you and preserve it in your minds\.
