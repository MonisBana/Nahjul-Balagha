**Sermon 129**

**Delivered When Abu Dharr \(l\\\) Was Exiled to Rabadha:**

O Abu Dharr\! You demonstrated your anger in the Name of Allah; therefore, have hope in Him for Whom you became angry\. The people were afraid of you in the matter of their \(seeking the pleasure of this\) world while you feared them for your faith\. Then leave to them that for which they are afraid of you and get away from them taking away what you fear them about\. How needy are they for what you dissuade them from and how heedless are you towards what they are denying you\. You will shortly know who is the gainer tomorrow \(on the Day of Judgement\) and who is more enviable\. Even if these skies and earth were closed to some individual and he feared Allah, then Allah will open them for him\. Only rightfulness should attract you while wrongfulness should detract you\. If you had accepted their worldly attractions they will have loved you and if you had shared in it they will have given you asylum\.

<a id="page542"></a>Abu Dharr al\-Ghifari’s name was Jundab ibn Junadah\. He was an inhabitant of ar\-Rabadha which was a small village on the east side of Medna\. When he heard about the proclamation of the Prophet \(h\), he

came to Mecca and after making inquiries saw the Prophet \(h\) and

accepted Islam whereupon the unbelievers of Quraish gave him all sorts of troubles and inflicted pain after pain, but he remained steadfast\. Among the acceptors of Islam he is the third, fourth or fifth\. Along with this precedence in Islam his renunciation and piety was so high that the Prophet \(h\) said, “Among my people, Abu Dharr is the like \`¦sa \(Jesus\)

son of Maryam \(Mary\) in renunciation and piety\.”

During the reign of \`Umar, Abu Dharr left for Syria, and during Othman’s reign, he also remained there\. He spent his days in counseling, preaching, acquainting people with the greatness of the members of the Prophet’s family and guiding the people to the rightful path\. The traces of Shi\`ism now found in Syria and Jabal Amil \(northern Lebanon\) are the result of his preaching and activity and the fruit of seeds sown by him\. The Governor of Syria, Mu\`awiyah, did not like the conduct of Abu Dharr and was much disgusted with his open criticism and mention of the money\-making and other wrongful activities of Othman\. But he could do nothing\. At last he wrote to Othman that if he remained there any longer he will rouse the people against the Caliph\. They should, therefore, be some remedy against this\. On this, Othman wrote to him that Abu Dharr should be seated on an unsaddled camel and dispatched to Medina\. The order was obeyed and Abu Dharr was sent to Medina\. On reaching Medina he resumed his preaching of righteousness and truth\. He will recall to the people the days of the Holy Prophet \(h\) and refrain them

from displays of extravagance, whereupon Othman was much perturbed and tried to restrict his freedom of speech\. One day, he sent for him and said, “I have come to know that you go about propagating that the Holy Prophet \(h\) said, “When Banu Umayyah become thirty in number, they

will regard the cities of Allah as their own property, His creatures as their slaves and His religion as the tool of their treachery\.”

Abu Dharr replied that he had heard the Prophet \(h\) say so\.

Othman said that he was speaking a lie\. Othman inquired from those beside him if any one of them had heard this tradition\. They all replied in the negative\.\.\.\! Abu Dharr then said that the same enquiry should be made from Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\. Ali \(x\) was sent for and asked about it\.

Ali \(x\) said that it was correct and that Abu Dharr was telling the truth\. Othman inquired on what basis he gave testimony for the correctness of

<a id="page543"></a>this tradition\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) replied that he himself had heard the Holy Prophet \(h\) say, “There is no speaker under the sky or over the earth more truthful than Abu Dharr\.”

Now Othman could do nothing\. If he still held him to be liar it will mean falsification of the Prophet \(h\)\. He, therefore, kept quiet

despite much perturbation, since he could not refute him\. On the other side Abu Dharr began speaking against the usurping of Muslims’ property quite openly and whenever he saw Othman he will recite this verse:

nd those who hoard up gold and silver and spend it not in Allah’s way; announce you unto them a painful chastisement\. On the Day \(of Judgement\) when it shall be heated in the fire of hell, then shall be branded with it their foreheads and their sides and their backs; \(saying unto them\) AThis is what you hoarded up for yourselves, taste you then what you did hoard u, p\. \(Holy Quran, 9: 34\-35\)

Othman promised him money but could not entrap this free man in his golden net, then resorted to repression but could not stop his truth\-speaking tongue\. At last he ordered him to leave and go to ar\-Rabadha and deputed Marwan, son of the man \(al\-Hakam\) exiled by the Prophet \(h\), to turn him out of Medina\. At the same time he issued the inhumane

order that no one should speak to him nor see him off\. But Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), Imam Hassan, Imam Hussain \(x\), Aqil ibn Abu Talib,

Abdullah ibn Ja\`far and Ammar ibn Yasir did not pay any heed to this order and accompanied him to see him off and Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) uttered these sentences \(i\.e\. the above sermon\) on that occasion\.

In Rabadha, Abu Dharr had to put up with a very hard life\. It was here that his son, Dharr, and his wife died and the sheep and goats that he was keeping for his livelihood also died\. Of his children, only one daughter remained who equally shared his starvation and woes\. When the means of subsistence were fully exhausted and day after day passed without food she said to Abu Dharr, “Father\! How long shall we go on like this? We should go somewhere in search of livelihood\.”Abu Dharr took her with him and set off for the wilderness\. He could not find even foliage to sustain themselves\. At last, he was tired; he sat down somewhere\. Then he collected some sand and, putting his head on it, lay down\. Soon he began gasping, his eyes rolled up and the pangs of death gripped him\.

<a id="page544"></a>When the daughter saw this condition, she was perplexed and said, “Father\! If you die in this vast wilderness, how shall I manage for your burial all by myself?”He replied, “Do not get upset\. The Prophet \(h\) told me that I shall die in helplessness and some Iraqis will arrange

for my burial\. After my death, you must put a sheet over me then sit by the roadway\. When some caravan passes by, tell them that the Prophet’s companion Abu Dharr has died\.”Consequently, after her father’s death, she went and sat by the roadside\. After some time, a caravan did, indeed, pass by\. It included Malik ibn al\-Harith al\-Ashtar an\-Nakh\`i, Hijr ibn Abdi at\-Ta’i, Alqamah ibn Qays an\-Nakh\`i, Sa\`sa\`ah ibn Suhhan al\-Abdi, al\-Aswad ibn Yazid an\-Nakh\`i etc\. who were all fourteen persons in number\. When they heard about the passing away of Abu Dharr they were shocked at his helpless death\. They stopped their riding beasts and postponed the onward journey for his burial\. Malik al\-Ashtar gave a sheet of cloth for his shroud\. It was valued at four thousand Dirhams\. After his funeral rites and burial they departed\. This happened in the month of Dhul\-Hijja, 32 A\.H\.
