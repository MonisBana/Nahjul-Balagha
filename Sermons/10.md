**About Talhah and az\-Zubayr 126**

Beware\! Satan has collected his group and assembled his horsemen and foot soldiers\. Surely, with me is my sagacity\. I have neither deceived myself nor ever been deceived\. By Allah, I shall fill to the brim

124Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) has rejected his claim in short form\. Thus, when

he admits that his hands had paid allegiance then until there is justification for breaking of the allegiance he should stick to it\. But, if, according to him his heart was not in accord with it, he should produce other proof for it\. Since proof about the state of heart cannot be adduced how can he bring such proof and an assertion without proof is unacceptable to his mind\.

125About the people of Jamal \(i\.e\. The enemy in the Battle of Jamal\) Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) says that they rose thundering, shouting and stampeding but when

encounter took place they were seen flying like straw\. At one time, they made loud claims that they would do this and that and now they showed such cowardice as to flee from the battlefield\. About himself, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) says, “We do not

threaten the enemy before battle, nor utter boasts, nor terrorize the enemy by raising unnecessary cries because it is not the way of the brave to use the tongue instead of the hand\. That is why on this occasion, he said to his comrades, “Beware of excessive talk as it is cowardice\.”

126When Talhah and az\-Zubayr broke away by violating the oath of allegiance and set for Basra in the company of Aisha, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) spoke

in these words which are part of the long speech\. Ibn Abul\-Hadid has written that in this sermon Satan denotes the real Satan as well as Mu\`awiyah because Mu\`awiyah was secretly conspiring the Talhah and az\-Zubayr and instigating them to fight against Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\); but the reference to the real Satan is more appropriate, obvious and in accord with the situation and circumstances\.

<a id="page364"></a>for them a cistern from which I alone would draw water\. They can neither turn away from it nor return to it\.
