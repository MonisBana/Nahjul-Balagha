**What Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Said on the Occasion of the Burial of the Supreme Lady, Fatima \(x\), While Addressing the Holy Prophet \(h\) at His Grave :**

O Prophet of Allah \(k\)\! Peace be upon you from me and from your daughter who has come to you and who has hastened to meet you\. O Prophet of Allah \(k\), my patience about your chosen \(daughter\) has been

exhausted and my power of endurance has weakened, except that I have ground for consolation in having endured the great hardship and heart\-rending event of your separation\. I laid you down in your grave when you breathed your last \(as your head was\) between my neck and chest\.

said: ‘O Salih\! Bring us that with which you did threaten us, if you are \[as you claim\] one of the Messengers\.’ Then the earthquake seized them \(while they were unaware\), so they became in their dwellings motionless\. Then he turned away from them and said: ‘O my people\! Indeed I did deliver to you the message of my Lord and did admonish you, but you do not love those who admonish you’” \(Holy Quran, 7: 73\-79\)\. \(The people of\) Thamud belied the warners and said: “What?\! A single man from among us \[thus dares to warn us\]\! And we are to follow him?\! Verily, then, we shall be straying and in distress\. It is that reminding has been bestowed on him \(alone\) of all people from among us?\! Nay\! He is a great liar and an insolent one\!’ Soon they shall know on the morrow \(as to\) who the liar is, the insolent one\. \(O Our Messenger Salih\!\) verily We are going to send the she\-camel as a trial for them; so, watch them and be patient\. And \(you O Salih\!\) make them aware \(beforehand\) that the water is \(to be\) divided between them, and every drinking share shall be witnessed\. But they called their companions, then he pursued and hamstrung her\. How \(great\) was My chastisement and My warning? Verily We sent upon them a single \(violent\) blast and they were \(all\) like the dry stubble used by a fencer in a fence” \(Holy Quran, 54: 23\-31\)\.

<a id="page683"></a>“Verily we are Allah’s and verily to Him shall we return” \(Holy Quran, 2: 156\)\.

Now, the trust has been returned, and what had been given has been taken back\. As to my grief, it knows no bounds, and as to my nights, they will remain sleepless till Allah chooses for me the house in which you are now residing\.

Certainly, your daughter will apprise you of the joining together of your191 umma \(people\) for the aim of oppressing her\. Ask her for the details and get all the news\. This has happened only a short period of time had elapsed, yet your remembrance has already disappeared\.\.\. My Salam be to you both, the Salam of a grief \-stricken one, ndighdf a disgusted nor a hateful one\. If I go away, it is not because I am weary \(of you\), and if I

191The treatment meted out to the daughter of the Prophet \(h\) after his death was extremely painful and sad\. Although Sayyidatul\-Nisa’\[head of all women of mankind\], Fatima \(x\), did not live in this world more than a few months after the death of her most revered father, the Prophet \(h\), yet even this

short period has a long tale of grief to tell and many woes\. In this regard, the first scene that strikes the eyes is the fact that the arrangements for the funeral rites of the Prophet \(h\) had not yet been made when the contest for power and authority started at the _saqifa_ \[shed\] of Banu Sa’idah\. Naturally, their leaving the body of the Prophet \(h\) \(without burial\) must have deeply injured the grief\-

stricken heart of Sayyidatul Nisa’, Fatima \(x\)\. She saw how those who had professed love and attachment to the Prophet \(h\)\) during his life\-life became so

engrossed in their machinations for pursuing power and authority, so much so that instead of consoling his only daughter, they did not even care to know when the Prophet \(h\) was to be given his funeral rites and when he was to be buried\.

And the way they “consoled” her was by crowding at her house after having brought firewood in order to set fire to her house and to burn everyone inside it\. All of this they did in order to secure the oath of allegiance by such brute force from her husband, Imam Ali \(x\), and from Ahl al\-Bayt \(x\)\. They justified all of

this coercion, compulsion and violence to achieve their goal of usurping the power of the government for themselves\. In fact, all these excesses were to obliterate the prestigious status of this house\. They thus hoped it might not regain its lost prestige on any occasion in the future\. With this aim in view, and in order to crush her economic status and that of her family, by confiscating her \(estate of\) Fadak through trickery and falsehood\.\.\., the ultimate effect was that Sayyidatul\-Nisa’ Fatima \(x\) was killed with grief in her heart, and even then,

none was there to witness her burial\. Till now, nobody even knows where she was buried\.\.\. Love for this world thus blinds people\.
