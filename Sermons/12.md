**Sermon 12**

When Allah gave Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) victory over the enemy

at the Battle of Jamal one of his comrades said on that occasion, AI wish my brother so\-and\-so had been present so that he, too, would have seen what success and victory Allah had given you\. It was then that Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) asked him, “Did you brother hold me as a friend?” The

comrade said, “Yes\.” Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) said, “In that case, he was

with us\. Rather, in this army of ours, even those persons were also present who are still in the loins of men and in the wombs of women\. Shortly, time will bring them out and faith will get strength through them\.”

If a person falls short in his actions, despite might and means, this would be indicative of the weakness of his will\. But if there is an impediment in the way of action or his life comes to an end as a result of which his action remains incomplete, then in that case Allah would not deprive him of the reward on the basis that actions are judged by intention\. Since his intention in any case was to perform the action, therefore, he should deserve reward to some extent\.

In the case of action, there may be absence of reward because action can involve show or pretense but intention is hidden in the depth of the heart\. It can have not a jot of show or affectation\. The intention would remain at the same level of frankness, truth, perfection and correctness

<a id="page368"></a>where it is, even though there may be no action due to some impediment\. Even if there is no occasion for forming intention but there is passion and zeal in the heart, a man would deserve reward on the basis of his heart’s feelings\. This is to what Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) has alluded to in this

sermon, namely that “If your brother loved me, he would share the reward with those who secured martyrdom for our support\.”
