**Sermon 31**

**Delivered Before the Commencement of the Battle of Jamal**

Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) sent Abdullah ibn Abbas to az\-Zubayr ibn

al\-Awwam with the purpose that he should advise him to obey\. He said the following to him on that occasion:

Do not meet Talhah \(ibn Ubaydillah\)\. If you meet him you will find him like an unruly bull whose horns are turned towards its ears\. He rides a ferocious riding beast and says it has been tamed\. Instead, meet with az\-Zubayr because he is soft\-tempered\. Tell him that your maternal

<a id="page409"></a>cousin says that, A\(It looks as if\) in the Hijaz you knew me \(accepted me\), but \(on coming here to\) Iraq you do not know me \(do not accept me\)\. So, what has dissuaded \(you\) from what was shown \(by you previously\)?

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “The last sentence of this sermon, i\.e\. Fama \`ada minna bada, has been heard only from Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)\.”
