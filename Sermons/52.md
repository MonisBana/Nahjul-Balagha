**Sermon 52**

**This Sermon Has Already Been Cited But, Due to the Difference Between the Two Versions, We Have Quoted it Again Here\. Its Subject Is the Downfall of the World and Reward and Punishment in the Hereafter\.**

Beware\! The world is wrapping itself up and has announced its departure\. Its known things have become strangers and it is speedily moving backward\. It is advancing its inhabitants towards destruction and driving its neighbors towards death\. Its sweet things \(enjoyments\) have become sour and its clear things have become polluted\. Consequently, what has remained of it is just like the remaining water in a vessel or a mouthful of water in the measure\. If a thirsty person drinks it his thirst shall not be quenched\.

O servants of Allah\! get ready to go out of this world for whose inhabitants decay is ordained\. \(Beware\) heart’s wishes should overpower you, nor should you take your stay \(in life\) to be long\. By Allah, if you cry like the she\-camel that has lost its young one or call out like the cooing of pigeons or make noise like devoted recluses and turn to Allah, leaving your wealth and children as a means to secure His nearness and high status with Him or the forgiveness of sins which have been covered by His books and recorded by His angels, it would be less than His reward that I expect for you or His retribution that I fear about you\.

By Allah, if your hearts thoroughly melt and your eyes shed tears of blood either in hopes for Him or for fear of Him and, if you are also allowed to live in this world all the time that it lasts, even then, your actions cannot pay for His great bounties over you and His having guided you towards faith\.

**A portion of the same sermon describing the Feast of Sacrifice \(\`¦d al\-Adha\) and the qualities of the animal for sacrifice\.**

For an animal to be fully fit for sacrifice it is necessary that both its ears be raised upwards and its eyes should be healthy\. If the ears and

<a id="page431"></a>the eyes are sound the animal of sacrifice is sound and perfect, even though its horn be broken or it drags its feet to the place of sacrifice\.

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: Here place of sacrifice means place of slaughter\.
