**On the Occasion of the Consultative Committee \(After the Death of Umar Ibn al\-Khattab\)**

No one preceded me in inviting people to truthfulness, in giving consideration to kinship and practicing generosity\. So, hear my word and preserve what I say\. Maybe you will see soon after today that over this matter swords will be drawn and pledges will be broken, so much so that some of you will become leaders of the people of misguidance and followers of people of ignorance\.
