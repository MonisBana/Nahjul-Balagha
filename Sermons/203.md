**What Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Provided the Following**

**General Advice to His Companions, Warning Them about the Perils of the Day of Judgement **:

May Allah have mercy on you\! Prepare provisions for the \[imminent\] journey \[to the life to come\] because the call for departure has been announced\. Regard your stay in this world as very short, and return \(to Allah\) with the best provisions with you because surely, in front of you lies a valley difficult to climb and places of stay full of fears and dangers\. You have to get there and to permanently stay\. And be admonished that the eyes of death are approaching you, fixed on you\. It is as though you are \(already\) in the talons of death, and it has struck you\. Difficult affairs and distressing dangers have crushed you into it\. You should, therefore, cut away all the attachments of this world and seek assistance with the provision of the fear of Allah\.

192When Hazrat Khadija, first wife of the Prophet \(k\), passed away,

she left neither a gold dinar nor a silver dirham\. Thus are we told by historians\. How many people are thus admonished, and how many act upon this admonishment? \_\_ Ed\.
