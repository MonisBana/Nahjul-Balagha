**Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) sent one of his men to bring him**

**news of a group of the army of Kufa who had decided to join the Kharijites but were afraid of him\.1 When the man came back, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said to him: “Are they satisfied and staying or feeling weak and going astray?” The man replied, “They have gone away, O Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib\!” Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said the following:**

They have turned away from truth and fallen into wrong; such suffices \(for their chastisement\)\.
