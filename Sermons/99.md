**About the Holy Prophet \(h\) and his Descendants :**

Praise be to Allah Who spreads His bounty throughout the creation and extends His hand of generosity among them\. We praise Him in all His affairs and seek His assistance for fulfillment of His rights\. We testify that there is no god except He and that Muhammad \(h\) is His

slave and Prophet \(h\)\. He sent him to manifest His commands and speak

about His remembrance\. Consequently, he fulfilled it with trustworthiness and he passed away while on the right path\.

He left among us the standard of right\. Whoever goes further from it goes out of faith, whoever lags behind it is ruined\. Whoever sticks to it will join \(the right\)\. Its guide is short of speech, slow of steps and quick when he rises\. When you have bent your necks before him and pointed towards him with your fingers his death will occur and will take him away\. They will live after him as long as Allah wills till Allah brings out for you one who will collect you together and fuse you after diffusion\. Do not place expectation in one who does not157 come forward and do not lose hope in one who is veiled because it is possible that one of the two feet of the veiled one may slip while the other may remain sticking, till both return to status and stick\.

Beware\! The example of the descendant of Muhammad \(h\) is

like that of stars in the sky\. When one star sets another rises\. So you are in a status that Allahâ€™s blessings on you have been perfected and He has shown you what you once wished for\.
