**Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Describes Here the Members of the Prophet’s Family**

They are the life of knowledge and the death of ignorance\. Their forbearance tells you of their knowledge and their silence the wisdom of their speech\. They do not go against right, nor do they differ \(among themselves\) about it\. They are the pillars of Islam and the havens of \(its\) protection\. With them, right has returned to its status and wrong has left its place, so its tongue is severed from the root\. They have understood the religion attentively and carefully, not by mere heresy nor from relaters because those who relate knowledge are many, but those who absorb it are few\.
