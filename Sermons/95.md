**Sermon 95**

**In Praise of Allah and of the Holy Prophet \(h\):**

Praise be to Allah Who is the First: nothing is before Him, and He is the Last, nothing is there after Him\. He is such Manifest that there is nothing above Him and such Hidden that there is nothing nearer than He\.

**Part of the Same Sermon about the Holy Prophet \(h\):**

His place of stay is the best of all places and his origin the noblest of all origins in the minds of honor and the cradles of safety\. Hearts of virtuous persons have been inclined towards him and the reins of eyes have been turned towards him\. Through him, “Allah buried mutual rancor and put off the flames of rebellion\. Through him He gave them affection like brothers and separated those who were together \(through unbelief\)\. His speaking is clear and his silence is \(indicative of\) the tongue\.

154In the atmosphere that had been created soon after the Prophet \(h\), Ahl al\-Bayt \(x\) \(members of his family\) had no course except to remain secluded

resulting in the world’s continued ignorance of their real qualities and being acquainted with their teachings and attainments\. To belittle them and keep them away from authority has been considered as the greatest service to Islam\. If Othman’s open misdeeds had not given a chance to the Muslims to wake up and open their eyes there will have been no question of allegiance to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and temporal authority will have retained the same course as it had

so far followed\. But all those who could be named for the purpose had no courage to come forward because of their own shortcomings while Mu\`awiyah was sitting in his capital away from the center\. In these circumstances there was none except Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) who could be looked at\. Consequently

people’s eyes hovered around him and the same common people who, following the direction of the wind, had been swearing allegiance to others jumped at him
