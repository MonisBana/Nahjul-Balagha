**Sermon 26**

**Arabia Before the Proclamation of Prophethood**

<a id="page395"></a>Allah sent Muhammad \(h\) as a warner \(against vice\) for all the

worlds and a trustee of His revelation, while you people of Arabia were following the worst religion and you resided among rough stones and venomous serpents\. You drank dirty water and ate filthy food\. You shed the blood of each other and cared not for relationships\. Idols were fixed among you and sins were clinging to you\.

**A portion of the same sermon on the attentiveness of the people after the death of the Holy Prophet \(h\):**

I looked and found that there was no supporter for me except my family, so I refrained from thrusting them unto death\. I kept my eyes closed despite motes in them\.

**Part of the same sermon on the settlement between**

The status of this mutual settlement was that when Amr al\-Mu’minn \(x\) sent Jarir

ibn Abdillah al\-Bajali to Mu\`awiyah to secure his allegiance, he detained Jarir under the excuse of giving a reply\. In the meantime he began exploring how far the people of Syria would support him\. When he succeeded in making them his supporters by rousing them to avenge Othman’s blood, he consulted with his brother Utbah ibn Abu Sufyan\. He suggested, “If in this matter \`Amr ibn As was associated, he would solve most of the difficulties through his sagacity, but he would not be easily prepared to stabilize your authority unless he got the price which he desired for it\. If you are ready for this, he would prove the best counselor and helper\.” Mu\`awiyah liked this suggestion, sent for \`Amr ibn As and discussed with him and eventually it was settled that he would avenge Othman’s blood by holding Amir al\-Mu’minin n \(x\) liable for it in exchange for the governorship of
