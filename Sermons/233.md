**Spoken When Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Was Busy in the Funeral Ablution \(Ghusl\) and Shrouding of the Holy Prophet \(h\)**

May my parents be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of Allah\! With your death, the process of Prophethood, the revelation and heavenly messages have stopped and which had not stopped at the death of others \(prophets\)\. Your status with us \(members of your family\) is so special that our grief for having lost you has become a source of consolation \(to us\) as against the grief of all others; our grief for having lost you is also common so that all Muslims may share it equally\. If you had not commended endurance and prevented us from wailing, we would have produced tears abundantly\. Even then, the pain will not have subsided and this grief will not have ended\. They will have been too little an indication of our grief for you\. But this \(death\) is a matter that cannot be reversed nor is it possible to avoid\. May my father and mother die for you; do remember us with Allah and take care of us\.
