**Sermon 206**

**In the Battle of Siffin, Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Saw Imam Al\-hasan Proceeding Rapidly to Fight, So He Said the Following :**

Hold back this young man on my behalf lest he should cause my ruin because I am loath to send these two \(meaning al\-Hassan and al\-Hussain\) towards death, lest the descending line of the Prophet \(h\) is cut off permanently by their death\.

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s words ‘amiku anni hadha’l\- ghulam’ \(i\.e\. Hold back this young man on my behalf\) represents the highest and the most eloquent form of expression\.”
