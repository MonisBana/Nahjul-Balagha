**Di’bil al\-Yemeni asked Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) whether he had seen Allah\. The Imam \(x\) then replied, “Do I worship One Whom I have not seen?\!” The man then inquired, “How have you seen Him?” Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) replied as follows :**\.

Eyes do not see Him face\-to\-face, but hearts perceive Him through the realities of belief\. He is near to things but not \(physically\) contiguous\. He is far from them but not \(physically\) separate\. He speaks but not with reflection\. He intends, but not with preparation\. He molds, but not with \(the assistance of\) limbs\. He is subtle but cannot be said as being concealed\. He is great but cannot be said to be haughty\. He sees but the faculty of vision cannot be attributed to Him\. He is Merciful, but this cannot be attributed to a weakness of heart\. Faces bow down before His greatness and hearts tremble out of fear of Him\.
