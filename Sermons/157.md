**Sermon 157**

**About the Holy Prophet \(h\) and the Holy Quran**

Allah deputed the Prophet \(h\) at a time when there had been no prophets for some time\. People had been in slumber for a long time and the twist of the rope had loosened\. The Prophet \(h\) came with \(a Book

containing\) testimonials to what \(Vols\.\) were already there and also with a light to be followed\. It is the Holy Quran\. If you ask it to speak it wo not do so; but I will tell you about it\. Be informed that it contains knowledge of what is to come about, stories of the past, cure for your ills and regulation for whatever faces you\.

**Part of the same sermon: Autocracy of the Umayyads**

At that time, there will remain no house nor tent but oppressors will inflict it with grief and inject sickness in it\. On that day, no one in the sky will listen to their excuse, and no one on the earth will come to their help\. You selected for the government \(caliphate\) one who is not fit for it, and you raised him to a status which was not meant for him\. Soon Allah will take revenge against everyone who has oppressed\. They will be given food for food and drink for drink: colocynth for eating, myrrh and aloes for drinking, and fear for an inner and the sword for an outer covering\.

They are nothing but beasts of burden laden carrying sins and like camels laden with evil loads of deeds\. I swear, and again swear, that the Umayyads will have to spit out the caliphate as phlegm is spat and, thereafter, they will never taste it nor relish its flavor so long as day and night rotate\.
