**About the Umayyads**

Banu Umayyah \(the Umayyads\) are allowing me the inheritance of Muhammad \(h\) bit by bit\. By Allah, if I live I would throw them

away as the butcher removes the dust from the dust\-covered piece of flesh\.

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: In one version for “al\-widhamu’ taribah” \(dust covered piece of flesh\) the words Aat\-turabulwadhimah \(the soil sticking on a piece of flesh\) have been shown\. That is, for the adjective the qualified noun and for the qualified noun the adjective has been placed\. As for the word “layufawwiqunani”, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) implies that they allow him bit by bit just as a she\-

camel may be milked a little then its young one may be made to suck milk so that it may be ready to be milked\. And “al\- widham” is the plural of “wadhamah” which means the piece of stomach or of liver which falls on the ground then the dust is removed from it\.
