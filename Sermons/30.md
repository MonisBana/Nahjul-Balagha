**Disclosing Real Facts about the Assassination of Othman Ibn Affan, Amir Al\-Mu’minin \(x\) Said:**

If I had ordered his assassination I should have been his killer, but if I had refrained others from killing him I would have been his helper\.

131After the battle of Nahrawan, Mu\`awiyah sent ad\-Dahhak ibn Qays al\-Fihri with a force of four thousand towards Kufa with the purpose that he should create disorder in the area, killing whomever he found and keeping them busy with bloodshed and destruction so that Amir al\-Mu’minan \(x\) should find no rest or

peace of mind\. He set off for the achievement of this aim and shedding innocent blood and spreading destruction all around reached the way up to the place of ath\-Tha\`labiyya\. He attacked a caravan of pilgrims \(to Mecca\) and looted all their wealth and belongings\. Then at al\-Qutqutana, he killed the nephew of Abdullah ibn Mas\`ud, the Holy Prophet’s companion, namely Amr ibn Uways ibn Mas\`ud together with his followers\. In this manner he created havoc and bloodshed all around\. When Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) came to know of this wreck and ruin he called

his men to battle in order to put a stop to this vandalism, but people seemed to avoid war\. Being disgusted with their lethargy and lack of enthusiasm he ascended the pulpit and delivered this sermon\. He roused the men to feel shame and not to try and avoid war but to rise for the protection of their country like brave men without employing wrong and lame excuses\. At last, Hijr ibn Adiy al\-Kindi rose with a force of four thousand for crushing the enemy and overtook them at Tadmur\. Only a small encounter has taken place between the parties when night came on and they fled with only nineteen killed on their side\. In Amir al\-Mu’minin’s army, two persons fell as martyrs\.

<a id="page401"></a>The status was that he who helped him cannot now say that he is better than the one who deserted him while he who deserted him cannot say that he is better than the one who helped him\. I am putting before you his case\. He appropriated \(wealth\) and did it badly\. You protested against it and committed excess the rein\. With Allah lies the real verdict between the one who appropriates and that who protests\.

Othman is the first Umayyad Caliph of Islam who ascended the Caliphate on the 1st of Muharram, 24 A\.H\. at the age of seventy\. After having wielded full control and authority over the affairs of the Muslims for twelve years, he was killed at their hands on the 18th of Dhul\-Hijja, 35 A\.H\. And was buried at Hashsh Kawkab\.

One fact cannot be denied: Othman’s killing was the result of his own weaknesses and the black misdeeds of the officers he appointed; otherwise, there is no reason that Muslims should have unanimously agreed on killing him while no one except a few of his own house stood up to support and defend him\. Muslims would have certainly given consideration to his age, seniority, prestige and distinction of companionship of the Prophet \(h\) but his ways and deeds had so marred

the atmosphere that no one seemed prepared to sympathize and side with him\. The oppression and excesses perpetrated on the high\-ranking companions of the Prophet \(h\) had roused a wave of grief and anger

among the Arab tribes\. Everyone was infuriated and looked at his haughtiness and wrong doings with disdainful eyes\. Thus, due to Abu Dharr’s disgrace, dishonor and the externment of Banu Ghifar and their associate tribes, due to Abdullah ibn Mas\`ud’s merciless beating of Banu Hudhayl and their associates, due to the breaking of the ribs of Ammar ibn Yasir Banu Makhzum and their associates Banu Zuhrah and due to the plot for the killing of Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr, Banu Taym all had a storm of rage in their hearts\. The Muslims of other cities were also brimful of complaints at the hands of his officers, who under the intoxication of wealth and the effects of luxury did whatever they wished and crushed whomever they wanted\. They had no fear of punishment from the center nor apprehension of any enquiry\. People were fluttering to get out of their talons of oppression but no one was ready to listen to their cries of pain and restlessness\. Feelings of hatred were rising but no care was taken to put them down\. The companions of the Prophet \(h\) were

also sick of him as they saw that peace was destroyed, the administration was topsy\-turvy and Islam’s features were being metamorphosed\. The poor and the starving were craving for dried crusts while Banu Umayyah were rolling in wealth\. The Caliphate had become a handle for belly\-

<a id="page402"></a>filling and a means of amassing wealth\. Consequently, they too did not lag behind in preparing the ground for killing him\. Rather, it was at their letters and messages that people from Kufa, Basra and Egypt had collected in Medina\. Observing this behavior of the people of Medina, Othman wrote Mu\`awiyah saying, “So now, certainly the people of Medina have turned heretics, have turned faith against obedience and broken the \(oath of\) allegiance\. Send me the warriors of Syria on brisk and sturdy horses\.”

The policy adopted by Mu\`awiyah on receipt of this letter also throws light on the condition of the companions\. Al \-Tabari, the renown historian, writes the following after this: “When the letter reached Mu\`awiyah he pondered over it and considered it bad to openly oppose the companions of the Prophet \(h\) since he was aware of their unanimity\.”

In view of these circumstances to regard the killing of Othman as a consequence of timely enthusiasm and temporary feelings and to hurl it at some insurgents is to veil the fact, since all the factors of his opposition existed within Medina itself, while those coming from without had collected for seeking redress of their grievances at their call\. Their aim was only improvement of the status, not killing or bloodshed\. If their complaints had been heard then an occasion for this bloodshed would not have arisen\. What happened was that when, having been disgusted with the oppression and excesses of \`Abdullah ibn Sa\`d ibn Abu Sahr who was foster brother of Othman, the people of Egypt proceeded towards Medina and camped in the valley of Dhakhushub near the city\. They sent a man with a letter to Othman and demanded that oppression should stop, the existing ways should be changed and repentance should be offered for the future\. But instead of giving a reply, Othman turned these men out of the house and did not consider their demands worthy of any attention\.

The people entered the city to raise their voice against this pride and haughtiness and complained to the people of this behavior besides other excesses\. On the other side many people from Kufa and Basra had also arrived with their complaints\. After joining with the se, together they proceeded forward with the additional backing of the people of Medina and confined Othman within his house, although there was no restriction on his going and coming to the mosque\. But in his sermon on the very first Friday he severely rebuked these people and even held them accursed, whereupon people got infuriated and threw pebbles at him\. As a result, he lost control and fell from the pulpit\. After a few days, his coming and going to the mosque was also banned\.

<a id="page403"></a>When Othman saw matters deteriorating to this extent he implored Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) very submissively to find some way for his rescue and to disperse the people in whatever way he could\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) said, “On what terms can I ask them to leave when their

demands are justified? Othman said, “I authorize you in this matter\.

Whatever terms you would settle with them I would be bound by them\.

So Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) went and met the Egyptians and talked to them\.

They consented to return on the condition that all the tyrannies should be wiped out and Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr made governor by removing ibn Abu Sahr\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) came back and put their demand before Othman who accepted it without any hesitation and said that to get over these excesses, time was required\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) pointed out that

for matters concerning Medina delay had no sense\. However, for other places so much time could be allowed that the Caliph’s message could reach them\. Othman insisted that three days were also needed for Medina\. After discussion with the Egyptians, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) agreed to it

also and took all the responsibility thereof upon himself\. Then they dispersed at his suggestion\. Some of them went to Egypt with Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr while some went to the valley of Dhakhushub and stayed there until this whole matter ended\. On the second day of this event, Marwan ibn al\-Hakam said to Othman, AIt is good, these people have gone, but to stop people coming from other cities you should issue a statement so that they should not come this way, but sit quiet at their places\. That statement should be that some people collected in Medina after hearing some irresponsible talk but when they came to know that whatever they heard was wrong they were satisfied and have gone back\. Othman did not want to speak such a clear lie but Marwan canvassed him, so he agreed\. Speaking in the Holy Prophet’s Mosque, he said, “These Egyptians had received some reports about their caliph, and when satisfied that they were all baseless and wrong, they went back to their cities\.”

No sooner had he said this when there was a great deal of mourning at the mosque, and people began to shout to Othman: “Repent\! Fear Allah\! What is this lie you are uttering?\!” Othman was confused in this commotion and had to offer repentance\. Consequently, he turned to the Ka\`ba, moaned in the audience of Allah and returned home\.

Probably after this very event, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) advised Othman saying, “You should openly offer repentance about your past

<a id="page404"></a>misdeeds so that these uprisings should subside for good\. Otherwise, if tomorrow people of some other places come, you will again cling to my neck to rid you of them\.” Consequently, Othman delivered a speech at the Prophet’s Mosque wherein he admitted his mistakes, offering repentance and swearing to remain careful in future\. He told the people that when he stepped down from the pulpit that their representatives should meet him and he would remove their grievances and meet their demands\. On this people acclaimed this action of his and washed away their ill\-feelings with tears to a great extent\.

When Othman reached his house, Marwan sought permission to say something, but Othman’s wife Na’ila daughter of Qarafisah intervened\. Turning to Marwan, she said, “For Allah’s sake, you keep quiet\. You will surely say only such a thing as will bring nothing but death to him\.” Marwan felt offended and retorted, “You have no right to interfere in these matters\. You are the daughter of that very person who did not know till his death how to perform his ablution\.” Na’ila replied with fury, “You are wrong and are laying a false blame\. Before uttering anything about my father, you should have cast a glance on the features of your own father\. But had it not been for my consideration for that old man, I would have spoken things at which people would have shuddered yet would have confirmed every word\.” When Othman saw how the conversation between his cousin and wife was getting prolonged and nasty, he stopped them and asked Marwan to tell him what he wished\. Marwan said, “What is it with you saying at the mosque what you said, and what repentance have you offered?\! In my view, sticking to the sin was a thousand times better than such repentance because no matter how great the sins might have been, they may multiply there, and there is always room for repentance still, but repentance by force is no repentance at all\. You have said what you have, but now see the consequences of this open announcement: The crowds of people are now at your door\. Now go forward and fulfil their demands\.” Othman then said, “Well, I have said what I have said\. Now you must deal with these people\. It is not in my power to deal with them\.” Consequently, finding out his implied consent, Marwan came out and addressing the people spoke out thus: “Why have you assembled here? Do you intend to attack or to ransack? Remember, you cannot easily snatch away power from our hands, take that idea out from your hearts that you would subdue us\. We are not to be subdued by anyone\. Take away your black faces from here\. Allah may disgrace and dishonor you\.”

When people noticed this changed countenance and altered picture, they rose from there full of anger and rage and went straight to

<a id="page405"></a>Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) and related to him the whole story\. On hearing it, mir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) was infuriated and immediately went to Othman and

said to him, “Good Heavens\! How badly you have behaved with the Muslims\! You have forsaken faith for the sake of a faithless and characterless man and have lost all wit\. At least you should have regard and consideration for your own promise\. What is this that at Marwan’s beckoning you have set off with your eyes folded? Remember this: He will throw you in such a dark well from which you will never be able to come out\. You have become the like a beast of burden for Marwan, so he can now ride on you as he pleases and put you on whatever wrong way he wishes\. In the future, I shall never intervene in your affairs, nor shall I tell people anything\. Now you should manage your affairs on your own\.”

Saying all this, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) got back, and when Na’ila

got the chance, she said to Othman, “Did I not tell you to get rid of Marwan or else he would put such a stain on you that it would not be removed despite all your efforts? Well, what is the good in following the words of one who is without any respect among the people and is held low before their eyes? Make Ali agree; otherwise, remember that restoring the disturbed state of affairs is neither within your power nor in that of Marwan\.” Othman was impressed by this statement, so he sent a man after Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\), but the Imam \(x\) refused to meet with

Othman\. There was no siege around Othman, but shame deterred him\. With what face could he come out of the house? But there was no way without coming out\. Consequently, he came out quietly in the gloom of night and reaching Amir al\-Mu’minin’s place, he moaned his helplessness and loneliness, offered excuses and also assured him of keeping promises but Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) said, “You make a promise in the Prophet’s

Mosque standing before all the people but it is fulfilled in this way that when people go to you they are rebuked and even abuses are hurled at them\. When this is the state of your undertakings which the world has seen, then how and on what grounds can I trust any word of yours in the future\. Do not have any expectation from me now\. I am not prepared to accept any responsibility on your behalf\. The tracks are open before you\. Adopt whichever way you like and tread whatever track you choose\.” After this talk, Othman came back and began blaming Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) in retort to the effect that all the disturbances were rising at his

instance and that he was not doing anything despite being able to do everything\.

<a id="page406"></a>On this side, the result of repentance was as it was\. Now let us see the other side\. When after crossing the border of Hijaz, Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr reached the place Aylah on the coast of the red Sea people caught sight of a camel rider who was making his camel run so fast as though the enemy was chasing him\. These people had some misgivings about him and, therefore, called him and inquired as to who he was\. He said he was the slave of Othman\. They inquired as to where he was bound\. He said Egypt\. They inquired to whom he was going\. He replied to the Governor of Egypt\. People said that the Governor of Egypt was with them\. To whom was he going then? He said he was to go to ibn Abu Sahr\. People asked him if any letter was with him\. He denied\. They asked for what purpose he was going\. He said he did not know that\. One of these people thought that his clothe s should be searched\. So the search was made, but nothing was found on him\. Kinanah ibn Bishr at\-Tujibi said, “See his water\-skin\.” People said, “Leave him, how can there be a letter in the water?\!” Kinanah said, “You do not know what cunning these people play\.” Consequently, the water\-skin was opened and seen\. There was a lead pipe in it wherein was a letter\. When it was opened and read, the Caliph’s order in it was that: “When Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr and his party reach you, then from among them kill so\-and\-so, arrest so\-and\-so, and put\- so\-and so in jail\. But you must remain at your post\.” On reading this, all were stunned and thus began to look at one another in astonishment\. As a Persian axiom says, “Mind was just burst in astonishment as to what wonder it was\!”

Those proceeding forward were riding into the mouth of death, consequently they returned to Medna taking the slave with them\. Reaching there they placed that letter before all the companions of the Prophet \(h\)\. Whoever heard this incident remained stunned with

astonishment and there was no one who was not abusing Othman\. Afterwards a few companions went to Othman along with these people and asked whose seal was there on this letter\. He replied that it was his own\. They inquired whose writing it was\. He said it was his secretary’s\. They inquired whose slave was that man\. He replied that it was his\. They inquired whose riding beast it was\. He replied that it was that of the Government\. They inquired who had sent it\. He said he had no knowledge of it\. People then said, “Good Heavens\! Everything is yours, but you do not know who had sent it\. If you are so helpless, you must leave this Caliphate and get away from it so that such a man can come who can administer the affairs of the Muslims\.” He replied, “It is not possible that I should put off the outfit of Caliphate which Allah has put on me\. Of course, I would offer repentance\.” People said, “Why should you speak of

<a id="page407"></a>repentance which has already been flouted on the day when Marwan was representing you on your door and whatever was wanting has been made up by this letter\. Now we are not going to be duped into these bluffs\. Leave the Caliphate, and if our brethren stand in our way we will hold them up; but if they prepare for fighting we too will fight\. Neither our hands are stiff nor our swords blunt\. If you regard all Muslims equally, if you uphold justice, hand over Marwan and enable us to inquire from him on whose strength and support he wanted to play with the precious lives of Muslims by writing this letter\.” But Othman rejected this demand, refusing to hand over Marwan to them, whereupon people said that the letter had been written at his behest\.

However, improving conditions again deteriorated and they ought to have deteriorated because despite lapse of the required time everything was just as it had been and not a jot of difference had occurred\. Consequently, the people who had stayed behind in the valley of Dhakhushub to watch the result of repentance again advanced like a flood and spread over the streets of Medina and closing the borders from every side, surrounded his house\.

During these days of siege a companion of the Prophet \(h\),

Niyar ibn AIyad, desired to talk to Othman, went to his house and called him\. When he peeped out from the above he said, “O Othman, for Allah’s sake give up this Caliphate and save the Muslims from this bloodshed\. While he was just conversing, one of Othman’s men aimed at him with an arrow and killed him, whereupon people were infuriated and shouted that Niyar’s killer should be handed over to them\. Othman said it was not possible that he would hand over his own support to them\. This stubbornness worked like a fan on fire and in the height of fury people set fire to his door and began advancing\. When Marwan ibn al\-Hakam, Sa\`id ibn al\-As and Mughirah ibn al\-Akhnas together with their contingents pounced upon the besiegers, killing and bloodshed started at his door\. People wanted to enter the house but they were being pushed back\. In the meanwhile, Amr ibn Hazm al \-Ansari whose house was adjacent to that of Othman opened his door and shouted for advancing from that side\. Thus through this house the besiegers climbed on the roof of Othman’s house and descended down from the re, drawing their swords\. Only a few scuffles had taken place when all except the people of Othman’s house, his well\-wishers and Banu Umayyah ran away in the streets of Medina and a few hid themselves in the house of Umm Habiba daughter of Abu Sufyan, sister of Mu\`awiyah\. The rest were killed with Othman as the latter kept defending himself to the last \(Al\-Tabaqat, Ibn Sa\`d, Vol\. 3,

<a id="page408"></a>Part 1, pp\. 50\-58; Tabari, Vol\. 1, pp\. 2998\-3025; Al\-Kamil, Ibn al\-Athir, Vol\. 3, pp\. 167\-180; Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 2, pp\. 144\-161\)\.

At his killing, several poets wrote eulogies\. A couplet from the elegy by Abu Hurayra is presented:

Today people have only one grief, but I have two:

The loss of my money bag and the killing of Othman\.

After observing these events, the status of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)

became clear, namely that he was neither supporting the group that was instigating Othman’s killing nor could he be included among those who stood for his support and defense\. Rather, when he saw that what was said was not acted upon he kept aloof\.

When both parties are looked at among the people who had raised their hands from Othman’s support, Aisha is seen as one\. And according to the popular versions \(which are not right\), the then living persons out of the ten pre\-informed ones \(who had been pre\-informed in this world by the Prophet \(h\) as being admitted into Paradise\), out of those who took

part in the consultative committee \(formed for Othman’s selection for caliphate\) Ansar, original Muhajirun, people who took part in the battle of Badr and other conspicuous and dignified individuals, while on the side \(of Othman\) are seen only a few slaves of the Caliph and a few individuals from Banu Umayyah\. If people like Marwan and Sa’id ibn al\-As cannot be given precedence over the original Muhajirun, their actions, too, cannot be given precedence over the actions of the latter\. Again, if ijma’ \(consensus of opinion\) is not meant for particular occasions\.\.\. only then it would be difficult to question this overwhelming unanimity of the companions\.
