**In Some of the Fighting Days of the Battle of Siffin, Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Said the Following to His Followers about the Methods of Fighting:**

O crowd of Muslims\! Make fear of Allah the routine of your life\. Cover yourselves with peace of mind and clinch your teeth because this makes the sword slip off from the skull\. Complete your armor and shake your swords in their sheathe s before showing them out\. Have your eyes

<a id="page441"></a>on the enemy\. Use your spears on both sides and strike \(the enemy\) with swords\. Keep in mind that you are before Allah and in the company of the Prophetâ€™s cousin\. Repeat your attacks and feel ashamed of running away because it is a shame for posterity and \(the cause of awarding you\) fire on the Day of Judgement\. Give your lives \(to Allah\) willingly and walk towards death with ease\. Beware of this great majority and the pitched tent and aim at its entirety as Satan is hiding in its corner\. He has extended his hand for assault and has kept back his foot for running away\. Keep on enduring till the light of Truth dawns upon you\.

While you have the upper hand and Allah is with you and never will He depreciate your deeds\. \(Holy Quran, 47: 35\)
