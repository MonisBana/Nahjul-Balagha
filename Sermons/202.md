**Transience of this World, the Importance of Collecting Provisions for the Next Life**

O people\! Certainly this world is a passage while the next is a place of permanent abode\. So, take from the passage \(all that you can\) for the permanent abode\. Do not tear away your curtain before the One Who is aware of your secrets\. Take your hearts away from this world before your bodies exit out of it\. Herein, you have been put on trial, and you have been created for the other world\. When a man dies, people ask what \(property\) he has left, while the angels ask what \(good actions\) he has sent forward \[to his Hereafter\]\. May Allah bless you; send forward something; it will be a loan for you\. Do not leave everything behind, for that will be a burden on you\.192
