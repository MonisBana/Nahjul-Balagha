**Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) Delivered this Sermon after the Arbitration**

All praise is due to Allah even though time has brought \(to us\) crushing calamity and great occurrence\. And I testify that there is no god but Allah the One, there is no partner for Him nor is there with Him any god other than Himself and that Muhammad \(h\) is His slave and Prophet

\(h\)\.

133This sentence is employed for such severance after which there is no occasion or possibility of joining\. The author of _Al\-Durra al\-Najafiyya_ has quoted several views in its explanation:

i\. Ibn Durayd’s view is that it means that, AJust as when the head is severed its joining again is impossible\. In the same way as you will not join me after once deserting me\.

1. Al\-Mufaddal says _ar\-ra’s_ \(head\) was the name of a man and a village of Syria, _Bayt ar\-ra’s_ is named after him\. This man left his home and went away somewhere and never again returned to his village after which the proverb sprang up Ayou went as _ar\-ra’s_ had gone\.
2. One meaning of it is that “Just as if the joints of the bones of the head are opened, they cannot be restored, likewise, you will not rejoin me after cutting yourselves away from me\.”
3. It has also been said that this sentence is in the sense of separating completely\. After copying this meaning from the _Sharh_ of Shaikh Qutbud\-Dn ar\-Rawandi, the commentator Ibn Abul\-Hadd has written that this meaning is not correct because when the word _ar\-ra’s_ is used in this sense of whole it is not preceded by _alif_ and _lam_\.
4. It is also taken to mean that “You will so run away from me as one \(fleeing for life\) to save his head\. Besides this, one or two other meanings have also been stated but being remote they are disregarded\.”

First of all it was used by the philosopher of Arabia Aktham ibn Sayfi while teaching unity and concord to his children\. He says the following:

“O my children\! Do not cut away \(from each other\) at the time of calamities like the cutting of the head because after that you will never get together\.”

<a id="page414"></a>So now, certainly the disobedience of a sympathetic counselor who has knowledge as well as experience brings about disappointment and that results in repentance\. I had given you my orders about this arbitration and put before you my hidden view that if Qasir’s2 orders were fulfilled but you rejected it \(my orders\) like rough opponents and disobedient insurgents till the counselor himself fell in doubt about his counsel and the flint \(of his wit\) ceased to give flame\. Consequently, my status and yours became as the poet of Hawazin says the following:

I gave you my orders at Mun’arajil\- Liwa’ but you did not see the good of my counsel till the noon of next day \(when it was too late\)\.

When the Syrians’ spirit was broken by the bloody swords of the Iraqis and the incessant attacks of the night of al\-Harir lowered their morale and ended their aspirations, Amr ibn al\-As suggested to Mu\`awiyah the trick that the Holy Quran should be raised on spears and shouts urged forth to treat it as the arbitrator\. Its effect would be that some people would try to stop the war and others would like to continue it\. We would thus divide them and be able to get the war postponed for another occasion\. Consequently, copies of the Holy Quran were raised on spears\. The result was that some brainless persons raised hue and cry and created division and disturbance in the army and the efforts of simple Muslims turned slow after having been near victory\. Without understanding anything they began to shout that they should prefer the verdict of the Holy Quran over war\.

When Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) saw the Holy Quran being the instrument of their activities, he said:

O people\! Do not fall in this trap of deceit and trickery\. They are putting up this device only to escape the ignominy of defeat\. I know the character of each one of them\. They are neither adherents of the Holy Quran nor have they any connection with the faith or religion\. The very purpose of our fighting has been that they should follow the Holy Quran and act on its injunctions\. For Allah’s sake do not fall in their deceitful device\. Go ahead with determination and courage and stop only after vanquishing the dying foe\. Nevertheless, the deceitful instrument of wrong had worked\.

People took to disobedience and rebellion\. Mis\`ar ibn Fadaki at\-Tamimi and Zayd ibn Hussain at\-Ta’i, each with twenty thousand men, came forward and said to Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) “O Ali\! If you do not

<a id="page415"></a>respond to the call of the Holy Quran, we will deal with you in the same manner as we did with Othman\. You end the battle at once and bow before the verdict of the Holy Quran \[is issued against you\]\.” Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) tried his best to make them understand the trick, but Satan was standing before them pretending to wear the garb of the Holy Quran\. He did not allow them to do so and they compelled Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) that he should send someone to call Malik ibn al\-Harith al\-Ashtar from the battlefield\. Being obliged, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) sent Yazid ibn Hani

to call Malik back\. When Malik heard this order he was bewildered and said, “Please tell him this is not the occasion to leave the status\. He may wait a bit then I will come to his audience with the tidings of victory\. Hani conveyed this message on return but people shouted that Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) must have sent word to him secretly to continue\.” Amir al\-

Mu’minin \(x\) said he never got any occasion to send any secret message to him\. Whatever he said was said before them\. People said he should be sent again and that if Malik delayed his return Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) should forsake his life\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) again sent Yazid ibn Hani

and sent word that rebellion had occurred, he should return in whatever condition he was\. So Hani went and told Malik “You hold victory dear or the life of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)\. If his life is dear you should raise your hands from the battle and go to him\. Leaving the chances of victory Malik stood up and came to the audience of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) with grief

and disappointment\.” The Aws raged there\. He rebuked the people very much but matters had taken such a turn that they could not be corrected\.

It was then settled that either party should nominate an arbitrator so that they should settle the Caliphate matter according to the Holy Quran\. From Mu\`awiyah’s side \`Amr ibn al\-\`\}s was decided upon and from Amir al\-Mu’minin’s side people proposed the name of Abu Musa al\-Ash\`ari\. Seeing this wrong selection Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) said,

“Since you have not accepted my order about arbitration at least now agree that do not make Abu Musa the arbitrator\. He is not a man of trust\. Here is Abdullah ibn Abbas and here is Malik al\-Ashtar\. Select one of them\. But they did not listen to him and stuck to his name \(Abu Musa\)\.” Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) said, “Alright, do whatever you want\. The day is

not far when you will cut your own hands through your misdeeds\.”

After the nomination of arbitrators, when the deed of agreement was being written, the name of Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) was also written\. \`Amr ibn al\-As said, “This should be rubbed off\. If we regard Amir al\-

<a id="page416"></a>Mu’minin \(x\), why should this battle have been fought?” At first, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) refused to rub it off but when they did not in any way

agree, he rubbed it off and said, “This incident is just similar to the one at al\-Hudaybiya when the unbelievers stuck on the point that the words AProphet \(h\) of Allah’ with the name of the Prophet \(h\) should be

removed and the Prophet \(h\) did remove it\.” On this, Amr ibn al\-As got angry and said, “Do you treat us as unbelievers\.” Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)

asked, “On what day have you had anything to do with believers and when have you been their supporters?” However, after this settlement, the people dispersed and after mutual consultation these two arbitrators decided that by removing both Ali and Mu\`awiyah from the Caliphate the people should be accorded the power to choose whomever they desired\. When time came to its announcement there was a meeting at Dawmatul\-Jandal, a place between Iraq and Syria then the two arbitrators also reached there to announce the judgement on the fate of the Muslims\. Acting cunningly \`Amr ibn al \-\`\}s said to Abu Musa, “I regard it ill manner to precede you\. You are older in years and age; so, first you make the announcement yourself\.” Abu Musa succumbed to his flattery and came out proudly\. Standing before the gathering, he addressed them thus: “O Muslims\! We have jointly settled that Ali ibn Abu Talib and Mu\`awiyah should be removed and the right to choose a Caliph be accorded to the Muslims\. They should choose whomever they like\.” Saying this he sat down\. Now the turn was for \`Amr ibn al\-\` \}s and he said, “O Muslims\! You have heard that Abu Musa has removed \`Amr ibn Abu Talib; I also agree with it\. As for Mu\`awiyah, there is no question of removing him\. Therefore, I place him in his status\.” No sooner than he said this there were cries all around\. Abu Musa cried hoarse that it was a trick, a deceit and said to \`Amr ibn al\-As, “You have played a trick and your example is that of a dog on which if you load something he would gasp, or leave him, he would gasp\.” Amr ibn al\-As said, “Your example is like the ass on whom books are loaded\.” However, \`Amr ibn al\-\` \}s trick was effective and Mu\`awiyah’s shaking feet were again stabilized\.

The above is a short sketch of the Arbitration whose basis was laid in the Holy Quran and Sunnah\. But was it a verdict of the Holy Quran or the result of those deceitful contrivances which people of this world always employ to retain their authority? Could these pages of history be made a torch\-guide for the future and the Holy Quran and Sunnah not be used as a means of securing authority or as an instrument of worldly benefits?

<a id="page417"></a>When Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) got the news of this lamentable

result of arbitration, he climbed on the pulpit and delivered this sermon every word of which savors his grief and sorrow and at the same time it throws light on soundness of his thinking, correctness of his opinion and foresighted sagacity\.

A proverb is used in this sermon borrowed from an occasion where the advice of a counselor is rejected and afterwards it is repented\. The fact is that the ruler of Hira, namely Jazimah al\-Abrash, killed the ruler of Jazira, \`Amr ibn Zarib\. Thereafter, his daughter Zabba was made the ruler of Jazira\. Soon after accession to the throne, she thought out a plan to avenge her father’s blood\. Then she sent a message to Jazmah that she could not alone carry on the affairs of the state and that if he could become her patron by accepting her as his wife, she would be grateful\. Jazmah was more than puffed up at this marriage proposal and prepared himself to set off for Jazira with a thousand horsemen\. His slave, Qasir, advised him repeatedly that this was just a sign of deceit and trickery, and that he should not place himself in this danger, but his wit had been so blinded that he could not think over why Zabba should select the murderer of her father as her life’s companion\. He then set off and reached the border of Jazira\. Although Zabba’s army was present for his reception\. she neither gave any special reception nor offered him a warm welcome\. Seeing this state, Qasir was again suspicious; he advised Jazmah to get back, but nearness to the goal had further fanned his passion\. Jazimah paid no heed and, stepping further, entered the city\. Soon after his arrival, he was killed there then\. When Qasir saw this he said, “Had the advice of Qasir been followed\.\.\. etc\. Since then, this proverb gained currency\.”

The poet of Hawazin referred to in this sermon is Durayd ibn as\-Simmah\. He wrote the above\-cited couplet after the death of his brother Abdullah ibn as\-Simmah\. Its facts are that \`Abdullah, along with his brother, led an attack of two groups of Banu Jusham and Banu Nasr who were both from Hawazin and drove away many camels\. On return when they intended to rest at Mun\`arajil\-Liwa, Durayd said it was not advisable to stay there lest the enemy attacks from behind, but Abdullah did not agree and stayed the re\. The result was that as soon as dawn appeared the enemy attacked and killed \`Abdullah on the spot\. Durayd also received wounds but he slipped away alive and after this he wrote a few couplets out of which one couplet is this wherein he has referred to the destruction resulting from his advice having been rejected\.
