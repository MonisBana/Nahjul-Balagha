**Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) delivering a lecture from the pulpit of \(the mosque of\) Kufa when al\-Ash\`ath ibn Qays1 objected and said, “O Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)\! This thing is not in your favor but against you\.2 Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) looked at him with anger and said:**

127Who is this al\-Ash\`ath ibn Qays al\-Kindi, anyway? His original name was Ma\`di Karb and surname Abu Muhammad but, because of his disheveled hair, he is better known as Al\-Ash\`ath, one having disheveled hair\. After the proclamation of Prophethood, he came to Mecca along with his tribe\. The Prophet \(h\) invited him and his tribe to accept Islam\. When, after the _Hijra_ \(migration of

the Holy Prophet \[h\] from Mecca to Medina\), Islam became established and in full

swing\. Deputations began to come to Medina in large numbers\. He, too, came to the Prophet’s audience with Banu Kindah and accepted Islam\. The author of _Al\-Isti\`ab_ writes that after the Prophet \(h\), this man again turned unbeliever but when the

Caliphate of Abu Bakr, he was brought to _Medina_ as a prisoner, he again accepted Islam, though this time too, his Islam was a show\. Thus, Shaikh Muhammad \`Abdo writes in his annotations on _Nahjul\-Balagha_:

Just as Abdullah ibn Ubayy ibn Sallul was a companion of the Prophet \(h\), al\-Ash\`ath was a companion of Ali and both were high\-ranking hypocrites\. He

<a id="page385"></a>How do you know what is for me and what is against me? Curse of Allah and other be on you\. You are a weaver and son of a weaver\. You are the son of an unbeliever and yourself a hypocrite\. You were arrested once by the unbelievers and once by the Muslims, but you wealth and birth could not save you from either\. The man who contrives for his own people to be put to sword and invites death and destruction for them does deserve that the near ones should hate him and the remote ones should not trust him\.

As\-Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “This man was arrested once when an unbeliever and once in the days of Islam\.” As for Amir al\-Mu’minin’s words that the man contrived for his own people to be put to the sword, the reference herein is to the incident which occurred to al\-

lost one of his eyes in the battle of Yarmuk\. Ibn Qutaybah has included him in the list of renown one\-eyed personalities\. Abu Bakr’s sister, Umm Farwah daughter of Ibn Abu Quhafah, who was once the wife of an al\-Azdi then of _Tamim_ ad\- Darmi, was on the third occasion married to this al\-Ash\`ath\. Three sons were born of her: Muhammad, Isma’il and Ishaq\. Biography books indicate that she was blind\. Ibn Abul\-Hadid has quoted the following statement of Abul\-Faraj wherefrom it appears that this man was equally involved in the assassination of Ali \(x\):

On the night of the assassination \[of Imam Ali \(x\)\], Ibn Muljim came to

al\-Ash\`ath ibn Qays and both retired to a corner of the mosque and sat there when Hijr ibn Adiy passed by that side and he heard al\-Ash\`ath saying to Ibn Muljim, ABe quick now or else dawn’s light will disgrace you\. On hearing this, Hijr said to al\-Ash\`ath, “O one\-eyed man\! You are getting ready to kill Ali \(x\) and hastened toward Ali ibn Abu Talib\. But Ibn Muljim had preceded him and struck Ali with a sword\. When Hijr turned back, people were crying\. Ali \(x\) had been killed\.

It was his daughter who killed Imam Hassan \(x\) with poison\. Al\-Mas\`udi has written the following:

His \(Hassan’s\) wife Ja\`dah daughter of al\-Ash\`ath poisoned him while Mu\`awiyah had conspired with her that if she could contrive to poison Hassan \(x\),

he would pay her one hundred thousand dirhams and marry her to \[his son\] Yazid\. \(Refer to _Muruj al\-Dhahab_, Vol\. 2, p\. 650\)

His son, Muhammad ibn al\-Ash\`ath, was active in playing fraud with Muslim bin Aqil in Kufa and in shedding Imam Hussain’s blood in Kerbala’\. Despite all these shameful stigmas, he is among those men from whom al\- Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud, al\-Tirmidhi, al\-Nisa’i and Ibn Majah have related traditions\.\.\.\!

<a id="page386"></a>Ash\`ath ibn Qays in confrontation with Khalid ibn al\-Walid at Yamama, where he deceived his people and contrived a trick until Khalid attacked them\. After this incident his people nicknamed him, “\`Urfan\-Nar,” which in the parlance stood for “traitor”\.

After the battle of Nahrawan, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) was delivering a sermon in the mosque of Kufa about the ill effects of Arbitration when a man stood up and said, “O Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)\!

First you discouraged us from this arbitration but thereafter you allowed it\. We cannot understand which of these two was more correct and proper\. On hearing this, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) clapped his one hand over the

other \[as a sign of sorrow and grief as well as helplessness\] and said, “This is the reward of one who gives up a firm view that is, this is the outcome of your own actions as you had abandoned firmness and caution and insisted on “arbitration”, but al\-Ash\`ath mistook it to mean as though Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) implied that Amy worry was due to having

accepted arbitration, so he spoke out thus: “O Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)\! This brings blame on your own self, whereupon Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) said the

following with firmness: “What do you know what I am saying, “nd what do you understand what is for me or against me?\! You are a weaver and the son of a weaver brought up by unbelievers, and a hypocrite are you\. The curse of Allah and that of all the world be upon you\.”

Commentators have written several reasons for Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) calling al\-Ash\`ath a weaver and a hypocrite\. The first

reason is because he and his father, like most of the people of his native land, pursued weaving cloth\. So, in order to refer to the lowliness of his occupation, he has been called a “weaver”\. The people of Yemen had other occupations also but mostly this profession was followed among them\. Describing their occupations, Khalid ibn Safwan has mentioned this one first of all\.

What can I say about a people among whom are only weavers, leather dyers, monkey keepers and donkey riders? The hoopoe found them out, the mouse flooded them128 and a woman ruled over them \(Al\-Bayan wal\-Tabyin, Vol\. 1, p\. 130\)\.

128This is a reference to the collapse of the famous Ma’rab Dam which was once considered one of the engineering marvels of ancient times\. Its collapse, which is believed to have taken place between B\.C\. 650 \- 115, caused the Arabs to migrate from Yemen and populate other parts of the Arabian peninsula\. \_\_ Ed\.

<a id="page387"></a>The second reason is that hiyaka means walking by bending on either side and since out of pride and conceit this man used to walk shrugging his shoulders and making bends in this body, he has been called hayik\.

The third reason is this: It is more conspicuous and clear that he has been called a weaver to denote his foolishness and lowliness because every low person is proverbially known as a “weaver”\. Their wisdom and sagacity can be well\-gauged by the fact that their follies had become proverbial while nothing attains proverbial status without peculiar characteristics\. Now that Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) has also confirmed it, no

further argument or reasoning is needed\.

The fourth reason is that by this it is meant the person who conspired against Allah and the Holy Prophet \(h\) and prepared webs of

which is the peculiarity of hypocrites\. Thus, in Wasa’il ash\- Shi\`a \(Vol\. 12, p\. 101\) it is stated that: “It was mentioned before Imam Ja\`far as\-Sadiq \(x\) that the weaver is accursed when he explained that the weaver

implies the person who concocts against Allah and the Prophet \(h\)\.”

After the word “weaver,” Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) has used the

word hypocrite and there is no conjunction in between them in order to emphasize the nearness of meaning thereof\. Then, on the basis of this hypocrisy and concealment of truth, he declared him deserving of the curse of Allah and all others, as Allah, the most Glorified One, says the following:

Verily, those that conceal what we have sent of \(Our\) manifest evidences and guidance, after what we have \(so\) clearly shown for mankind in the Book \(they are\), those that Allah does curse them and \(also\) curse them all those who curse \(such ones\) \(Holy Quran, 2: 159\)\.

After this, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) said, “You could not avoid the

degradation of being prisoner when you were unbeliever, not did these ignominies spare you after acceptance of Islam and you were taken prisoner\. When an unbeliever, the event of his being taken prisoner occurred in this way that when the tribe of Banu Murad killed his father Qays, he \(al\-Ash\`ath\) gathered the warriors of Banu Kindah and divided them into three groups\. He himself took the command over one group\. On the others, he placed Ka\`b ibn Hani’ and al\-Qash\`am ibn Yazid al\-Arqam

<a id="page388"></a>as commanders\. They set off to deal with Banu Murad\. But as misfortune would have it, instead of Banu Murad, they attacked Banu al\-Harith ibn Ka\`b\. The result was that Ka\`b ibn Hani’ and al\-Qash’am ibn Yazid al\-Arqam were killed and this man was taken prisoner\. Eventually, he got released by paying three thousand camels as his ransom\. In Amir al\-Mu’minin’s words, “Your wealth or birth could not save you from either is a reference not to the real ransom money because he was actually released on payment of the release money, but the intention is that neither plenty of wealth nor high status and prestige in the tribe could save him from this ignominy, and he could not protect himself from being taken captive\.

The event of his second imprisonment is that when the Holy Prophet of Islam \(h\) passed away from this world, a rebellion took place

in the area of Hadramawt for repelling which Caliph Abu Bakr wrote to its governor, Ziyad ibn Labid al\-Bayadi al\-Ansari, to secure allegiance and collect zakat and charities from those people\. When Ziyad ibn Labid went to the tribe of Banu Amr ibn Mu\`awiyah for collecting the zakat, he took a keen fancy for a she\-camel of Shaytan ibn Hijr which was very handsome and had a huge body\. He jumped over it and took possession of it\. Shaytan ibn Hijr did not agree to spare it and suggested to him to take some other she\-camel in its place, but Ziyad did not agree\. Shaytan sent for his brother al\-Adda’ ibn Hijr for his support\. On coming he too had a talk but Ziyad insisted on this point and did not, by any means, consent to keep off his hand from that she\-camel\. At last, both these brothers appealed to Masruq ibn Ma’di Karib for help\. Consequently, Masruq also used his influence so that Ziyad might leave the she\-camel but he refused categorically, whereupon Masruq became enthusiastic and untying the she\-camel handed it over to Satan\. On this, Ziyad was infuriated and collecting his men became ready to fight\. On the other side, Banu Wali’ah also assembled to face the but could not defeat Ziyad and were badly beaten at his hands\. Their women were taken away and property was looted\. Eventually those who had survived were obliged to take refuge under the protection of al\-Ash\`ath\. Al\-Ash\`ath promised assistance on the condition that he should be acknowledged ruler of the area\. Those people agreed to this condition and his coronation was also formally solemnized\. After having his authority acknowledged he arranged an army and set out to fight Ziyad\. On the other side Abu Bakr had written to the chief of Yemen, al\- Muhajir ibn Abu Umayyah to go for the help of Ziyad with a contingent\. Al\-Muhajir was coming with his contingent when they came face\-to\-face\. Seeing each other, they drew swords and commenced fighting at az\-Zurqan\. In the end al\-Ash\`ath fled from the battle\-field and taking his remaining men closed himself in the fort of an\-Najjar\. The

<a id="page389"></a>enemy was such as to let them alone\. They laid siege around the fort\. Al\-Ash\`ath thought how long could he remain shut up I the fort with the lack of equipment and men and that he should think out some way of escape\. So one night he stealthily came out of the fort and met Ziyad and al\-Muhajir and conspired with them that if they gave asylum to nine members of his family, he would get the fort gate opened\. They accepted this term and asked him to write for them, the names of those nine persons\. He wrote down the nine names, but acting on his traditional wisdom forgot to write his own name in that list\. After settling this, he told his people that he had secured protection for them and the gate of the fort should be opened\. When the gate was opened Ziy\\sect fs22 ad As forces pounced upon them\. They said they had been promised protection whereupon Ziyad’s army said that this was wrong and that al\-Ash\`ath had asked protection only for nine members of his house, whose names were preserved with them\. In short, eight hundred persons were put to sword and the hands of several women were hopped off, while according to the settlement, nine men were left, but the case of al\-Ash\`ath became complicated\. Eventually, it was decided that he should be sent to Abu Bakr and he should decide about him\. At last, he was sent to Medina in chains along with a thousand women prisoners\. On the way, relations and others, men and women, all hurled curses at him and the women were calling him traitor and the one who got his own people put to sword\. Who else can be a great traitor? However, when he reached Meduna, Abu Bakr released him and on that occasion, he was married to Umm Farwah\.
