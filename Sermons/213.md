**Sermon 213**

**The Prophet’s Nobility of Descent**

I testify that He is just and implements justice\. He is the arbiter Who decides \(between right and wrong\)\. I also testify that Muhammad

<a id="page702"></a>\(h\) is His slave, Messenger and the Chief of His creatures\. When Allah

divided the line of descent, He placed his in the very best place\. Therefore, no evil\-doer ever shared with him, nor was any vicious person his partner\.

Beware\! Surely Allah, the Glorified One, has provided for virtue those who are suited for it, for truth pillars \(that support it\), and for obedience protection \(against deviation\) \. In every matter of obedience, you would find Allah, the Glorified One, succor that would speak through tongues and accords firmness to the hearts\. It has sufficiency for those who seek sufficiency, a cure for those who seek a cure\.

**Characteristics of the virtuous whose guidance must be emulated**

Be informed that, certainly, those servants of Allah Who preserve His knowledge offer protection to those things which He desires to be protected and make His springs flow \(for the benefit of others\)\. They contact each other with friendliness and meet each other with affection\. They drink water from cups that quench the thirst and return from the watering places fully satiated\. Misgiving does not affect them; backbiting does not gain ground with them\. In this way Allah has tied their nature with good manners\. Because of this, they love and meet each other\. They have become superior like seeds which are selected by taking some and throwing away others\. This selection has distinguished them, and the process of choosing has purified them\.

Therefore, man should secure honor by adopting these qualities\. He should fear the day of Doom before it arrives; he should appreciate the shortness of his life and the shortness of his sojourn in the place of stay which has only to last for his journey to the next abode\. He should, therefore, do something for his change over and for the known stages of his departure\. Blessed be whoever possesses a virtuous heart, who obeys one who guides him, desists from him who takes to ruin, catches the path of safety with the help of him who provides light \(of guidance\), obeying the leader who commands him, hastens towards guidance before its doors are closed, opens the door of repentance and removes the \(stain of\) sins\. He has certainly been put on the right path and guided towards the straight road\.
