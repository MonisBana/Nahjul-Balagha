**Condemning Treason**

O people\! Surely the fulfillment of a pledge is the twin of truth\. I do not know a better shield \(against the assaults of sin\) than it\. One who realizes the reality of return \(to the next world\) refuses \(submission to the dynamic of\) betrayal\. We are in a period when most of the people regard betrayal as wisdom\. In these days the ignorant call it excellence of cunning\. What is the matter with them? Allah may destroy them\. One

battlefield\. Even in their retreat, Malik attacked them from rear and killed three of their men\.

<a id="page423"></a>who has been through the thick and thin of life finds the excuses to be preventing him from acquiescing to the orders and prohibitions of Allah\. Yet he disregards them despite the capability \(to succumb to them and follows the commands of Allah\), while one who has no restraints of religion seizes the opportunity \(and accepts the excuses for not following the commands of Allah\)\.
