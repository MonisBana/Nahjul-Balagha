**Sermon 229**

**Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) delivered this sermon at Thi\-Qar**

**on his way to Basra\. The historian al\-Waqidi has mentioned it \(in Kitab al\-Jamal\)\.**

**About the Holy Prophet \(h\):**

The Prophet \(h\) manifested whatever he was commanded and

conveyed the message of his Lord\. Consequently, Allah repaired through him the cracks, joined through him the slits and created \(through him\)

<a id="page725"></a>affection among kin although they bore intense enmity in \(their\) chests and deep\-seated rancor in \(their\) hearts\.
