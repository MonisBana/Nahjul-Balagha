**When people went to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) in a**

**deputation and complained to him about Othman, requesting him to speak to him on their behalf and to admonish him for their sake, he went to see Othman to whom he said the following : 1**

The people are behind me and they have made me an ambassador between you and themselves; but by Allah, I do not know what to say to you\. I know nothing \(in this matter\) which you do not know, nor can I lead you to any matter of which you are not aware\. You certainly know what we know\. We have not come to know anything before you which we could tell you, nor did we learn any secret which we should reveal to you\. You have seen as we have seen and you have heard as we have heard\. You sat in the company of the Prophet of Allah \(h\) as we did\. \(Abu

Bakr\) the son of AbiQuhafah as well as \(Umar\) ibn al\-Khattab were no more responsible for acting righteously than you, since you are nearer than both of them to the Prophet of Allah \(k\) through kinship and you also hold relationship to him by marriage which they do not have\.

Then \(fear\) Allah, with regard to your own self for, by Allah, you are not being shown anything as if you are blind or being apprised of anything as if you are ignorant\. Everything is clear while the banners of faith are fixed\. You should know that among the servants of Allah, the most distinguished person before Allah is the just imam who has been guided \(by Allah\) and who guides others\. So, he stands by the recognized ways of the Prophet’s behavior and destroys unrecognized innovations\. The \(Prophet’s\) ways are clear and they have signs, while innovations are also clear and they, too, have signs\. Certainly, the worst man before Allah is the oppressive imam who has gone astray and through whom others go astray\. He destroys the accepted Sunnah and revives abandoned innovations\. I heard the Messenger of Allah saying: “On the Day of Judgement, the oppressive imam will be brought with none to support him

<a id="page590"></a>or to advance excuses on his behalf\. Then he will be thrown into Hell where he will rotate as the hand\-mill rotates, then \(eventually\) he will be confined to its hollow\.

I swear to you by Allah that you should not be such an imam of the people who will be killed because it has been said that an imam of this people will be killed after which killing and fighting will be made open for them till the Day of Judgement and he will confuse their matters and spread troubles over them\. As a result, they will not distinguish right from wrong\. They will oscillate like waves and will be utterly misled\. You should not behave as the beast of burden for Marwan \[ibn al\-Hakam, your cousin\] so that he may drag you wherever he likes, despite \(your\) seniority of age and length of life\.

It was then that Othman said the following to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\): “Ask the people to give me time till I redress their grievances\.” Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said, “As far as Medina is concerned, time is

out of the question\. As for more remote areas, you can have the time needed for your order to reach your objectives\.”

During the Caliphate of Othman, the Muslims were weary of the oppression of the Government\. Its officials gathered in Medina to complain to the senior companions of the Prophet \(h\)\. They came to

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) in a peaceful manner and requested him to

see Othman and advise him not to trample on the Muslims’ rights and to put an end to the troubles which were proving to be the cause of the people’s ruin\. It was then that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) went to him and spoke those words\.

In order to make the bitterness of the admonition palatable, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) adopted that way of speech in the beginning which

will create a sense of responsibility in the addressee and direct him towards his obligations\. Thus, by referring to his being a companion of the Prophet \(h\), his personal status and kinship to the Prophet \(h\) as

compared with the two caliphs who preceded him, his intention was to make him realize his duties\. At any rate, this was obviously not an occasion for eulogizing him, so its latter portion can be disregarded and the whole speech be regarded as a praise of his accomplishments because from its very beginning, it is evident that whatever Othman did, he did it wilfully, that nothing was done without his knowledge or his being

<a id="page591"></a>informed, and that he could not be held unaccountable for it because of his being unaware of it\.

If the adoption of a line of action which made the whole Islamic world raise hue and cry in spite of his having being a companion of the Prophet \(h\), having heard his instructions, having seen his behavior and

having been acquainted with the commandments of Islam, can be regarded as a distinction, then this taunt may also be regarded as a praise\. If that is not a distinction, then this, too, cannot be called a praise\. In fact, the words about which it is argued, i\.e\. that they are complimentary, are enough to prove the seriousness of his crime because a crime in ignorance and unawareness is not so serious as the one carrying the weight given to the seriousness of the commission of a crime despite one’s knowledge and awareness\. Consequently, a person who is unaware of the rise and fall of a road and stumbles in the dark night is to be excused, but a person who is aware of the rise and fall of the road, so he stumbled in broad day light, is liable to be blamed\. If, on this occasion, he is told that he has eyes and is also aware of the rise and fall of the way, it will not mean that his vastness of knowledge or the brightness of his eyesight is being praised, but the intention will be that he did not notice the pitfalls despite his eyes and did not walk properly\. For him, therefore, having or not having eyes is the same and knowing is equal to not knowing at all\.

In this regard, a great emphasis is placed on his being a son\-in\-law of the Prophet \(h\), having married two of daughters, namely Ruqayya and Umm Kulthum, one after the other174

Before taking this to be a distinction, the real nature of Othman as the Prophet’s son\-in\-law should be scrutinized\. History shows that in this matter Othman did not enjoy the distinction of being the first \[to marry them\]\. Before him, Ruqayya and Umm Kulthum had been married to two sons of Abu Lahab, namely Utbah and Utaybah \[who is condemned in the Holy Quran\]\. Yet despite their being sons\- in\-law, they were not been included among the people of prestige during the time preceding the dawn of Prophethood\. How, then, can this be regarded as a source of distincion without any personal merit, when there is no authority about the importance of this relationship, nor was any importance attached to this matter in such a way that there might have been some competition

174Many historians assert that both Ruqayya and Umm Kulthum were daughters of Khadija, the Prophet’s first wife, by her second husband, Ateeq ibn \`Aaith of Banu Makhzum\. Both ladies, therefore, were not daughters of the Prophet \(k\) but his step\-daughters\.

<a id="page592"></a>between Othman and some other important personality in this regard and that his selection for it might have given him prominence, or that the two ladies might have been shown to possess an important status in history, tradition or biography as a result of which this relationship could be given a special importance and regarded as a cause of one’s distinction?\! If the marriage of these two daughters to Utbah and Utaybah during the period of jahiliyya is held as lawful on the ground that marriage with the unbelievers had not till then been made unlawful, then in Othman’s case, the condition for lawfulness was his acceptance of Islam\. There is no doubt that he had pronounced the Kalima \(ash\-shahadatayn: “There is no god but Allah and Muhammad \(h\) is His Messenger”\) and had accepted

Islam publicly\. As such, this marriage can be held a proof of his acceptance of Islam\. But no other honor can be proved through it\. Again, it is also not agreed upon that these two ladies were the real daughters of the Messenger of Allah because there is one group \[of historians\] which disproves their being the Prophet’s real daughters, tracing their descent as the daughters of Khadija’s sister, Halah, or her daughters by her own previous \[second\] husband\. Thus, Abul\-Qasim al\-Kufi \(d\. 352 A\.H\.\) writes the following:\.

“Some time prior to the Messenger of Allah \(k\) marrying

Khadija, \[Abu\] Halah \[second husband of Khadija\] died, leaving two daughters, one named Zainab and the other named Ruqayyah\. Both of the latter were \[later\] raised by the Prophet \(h\) and Khadija, looking after

them as it was the custom before Islam when a child was assigned to whoever brought him up” \(Al\-Istighatha, p\.69\)\.

Ibn Hisham has written the following about the issues of Hadrat Khadija:\.

“Before her marriage to the Prophet \(h\), she was married to Abu

Halah ibn Malik\. She delivered for him Hind, son of Abu Halah, and Zainab, daughter of Abu Halah\. Before her marriage to Abu Halah, she had been married to \`Utayyiq \[or \`Ateeq according to other references\] ibn Abid ibn Abdillah ibn Amr ibn Makhzum and she delivered for him Abdullah and a daughter” \(Al\-Sira al\-Nabawiyya, Vol\. 4, p\. 293\)\.

This prove that Hadrat Khadija had two daughters before being married to the Prophet \(h\)\. According to all evidences, they will be

called his “daughters” and those to whom they were married will be called his “sons\-in\-law,” but the status of this relationship will be the same as if those girls were his daughters\. Therefore, before putting it forth

<a id="page593"></a>as a matter of pride, the real status of the daughters should be noted and a glance should be cast at Othman’s conduct\. In this regard, al\-Bukhari and other narrators \(of traditions\) as well as historians record this tradition as follows:\.

Anas ibn Malik relates that: “We were present on the occasion of the burial of the Prophet’s daughter Umm Kulthum\. While the Prophet \(h\) was sitting beside her grave, I saw his eyes shedding tears\. Then he said, ‘Is there anyone among you who has not committed a sin last night?’ Abu Talhah \(Zayd ibn Sahl al\-Ansari\) said, ‘I’ The Prophet \(h\) said, ‘Then you get into the grave\.’ He got down into the grave\.”

The commentators said that by “committed a sin”, the Holy Prophet \(h\) meant to say “anyone who had not had sexual intercourse\.”175

On this occasion, the Holy Prophet \(h\) unveiled the private life

of Othman and prevented him from getting down into the grave, although it was a prominent merit of the Prophet’s character that he did not disgrace or belittle anyone by publicly exposing his private life and despite his knowledge of others’ shortcomings which he ignored\. But in this case, the filth was such that it was deemed necessary to disgrace him before the whole crowd\.

Since Othman did not show any regard for the demise of his wife \(Umm Kulthum\), nor was he moved or felt sorry \(for this event\), thus paying no heed to severing his relationship with the Holy Prophet \(h\) \(for being his son\-in\-law\), he \(Othman\) had a sexual intercourse on the same night; therefore, the Holy Prophet \(h\) deprived him of this right

and honor\. For more details, refer to: al\-Bukhari, Sahih, Vol\. 2, pp\. 100\-101, 114; Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Al\- Musnad, Vol\. 3, pp\. 126, 228, 229, 270; al\-Hakim, Al\- Mustadrak, Vol\. 4, p\. 47; al\-Bayhaqi, Al\-Sunan al\-Kubra, Vol\. 4, p\. 53; Ibn Sa\`d, Al\-Tabaqat al\-Kubra, Vol\. 8, p\. 26; as\-Suhayli, Al\-Rawd al\-Anif, Vol\. 2, p\. 107; Ibn Hajar, Al\-Isaba, Vol\. 4, p\. 489; Fath al\-Bari, Vol\. 3, p\. 122; al\-Ayni, \`Umdat al\-Qari, Vol\. 4, p\. 85; Ibn al\-Athir, Al \-Nihaya, Vol\. 3, p\. 276; Ibn Manzur, Lisan al\-\`Arab, Vol\. 9, pp\. 280\-281; az\-Zabidi, Taj al\-Arus, Vol\. 6, p\. 220\.

175Is committing any sexual intercourse a sin?\! Not at all if it is with one’s own wife; it will be regarded as a good deed as we are told in _hadith_\. But such is the text we have to work with\. As an editor, I had to work with this text without the good fortune of comparing it with the original Arabic text\.
