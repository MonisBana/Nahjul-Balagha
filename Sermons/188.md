**Steadfastness versus a Transient Belief**

One belief is \(conviction\) which is firm and steadfast in the hearts\. Another remains temporarily in one’s heart up to a certain period of time\. If you were to acquit \(yourselves\) before anyone, you should wait till death approaches, for that is the time limit for being acquitted\.

Migration stands as its original status\. Allah has no need for one who secretly accepts belief or one who openly does so\. Migration \(to the other world\) will not apply to any one unless he recognizes the proof \(of Allah\) on the earth\. Whoever recognizes him and acknowledges him will be a muhajir \(immigrant\) \. Istid’af \(i\.e\. freedom from the obligation of migration\) does not apply to him whom the proof \(of Allah\) reaches and he hears it and his heart preserves it\.187

187This is the interpretation of the words _muhajir_ and _mustad’af_ as mentioned in the Holy Quran: _Verily those whom the angels take away \(at the_ *time of death\), being unjust to their \(own\) selves, they \(the angels\) shall ask \(the sinning souls\): “In what state were you? They shall reply: Weakened \(*mustad’af

- *oppressed\) were we in the land; they \(angels\) will say: Was not the land of Allah vast \(enough\) for you to traverse therein? So these \(are those\) whose refuge shall be Hell, and what a bad resort it is\! Except the \(really\) weakened ones from among the men, women and children who have not in their power the means \(to escape from the unbelievers\) nor do they find the \(right\) way\. Allah will perhaps pardon them, and Allah is the Clement, the Oft\-forgiving One \(4: 97\-99\)\. *The meaning of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) here is that* hijra *\(migration\) was not only obligatory during the lifetime of the Holy Prophet \(h\),

<a id="page643"></a>**The challenge of “Ask me before you miss me” and a prediction about the Umayyads**

Certainly, our case is difficult and complicated\. No one can bear it except a believer whose heart Allah has tried with belief\. Our traditions will not be preserved except by trustworthy hearts and \(men of\) firm understanding\. O people\! Ask me before you miss me because certainly I am acquainted with the passages of the sky more than the passages of the earth, and before that mischief springs upon its feet which will trample even the nose string and destroy the wits of the people\.

Some people have explained this saying of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) to mean that by the passages of the earth he means matters of the world and by passages of the sky matters of religious law and that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) intends to say that he knows the matters of

religious law and commandments more than the worldly matters\. Thus, Ibn Maytham al\-Bahrani writes \(in Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 4, pp\. 200\-201\):\.

Allama al\-Wabari is quoted as having said that the gist of the intention of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) is this: The scope of his religious

knowledge is greater than his knowledge about matters relevant to the world\.

But taking the context into account, this explanation cannot be held as correct because this sentence \(being explained\) has been used as the cause of the sentence “Ask me before you miss me” and after it is the prediction of a rebellion\. In\-between these two, the occurrence of the sentence “I know religious matters more than worldly matters” makes the whole utterance quite disregarded because Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s challenge to ask whatever one likes is not confined to matters of the religious law only, so this sentence could be held as its cause\. After that, the prediction of the rebellion has nothing to do with matters of the

but it is a permanent obligation\. This migration is nowadays obligatory for attaining the proof of Allah and the true religion\. Therefore, if one has attained the proof of Allah and believed in it, even if he is in midst of the unbelievers of his locality, he is not duty\-bound to migrate\.

The _mustad’af_ \(weakened\) is one who is living among the unbelievers and is far from being informed of the proofs of Allah and, at the same time, he is unable to migrate in order to attain knowledge of the Signs of Allah\.

<a id="page644"></a>religious law so that it could be put forth as a proof of more knowledge of religious matters\. To ignore the clear import of the words and to interpret them in a way which does not suit the occasion, does not exhibit a correct spirit when from the context also the same meaning accrues, one which the words openly convey\. Thus, it is to give a warning about the Umayyad’s mischief that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) uttered the

statement “Ask me whatever you like because I know the paths and courses of the Divine destiny more than the passages of the earth\. So, even if you ask me about matters which are recorded in the Preserved Tablet and which concern the Divine destiny, I can tell you\. A serious mischief is to rise against me in those matters in which you should have doubt because my eyes are more acquainted with those ethereal lines which concern the occurrence of events and mischiefs than with what I know about life as it appears on earth\. The occurrence of this mischief is as certain as an object seen with the eyes\. You should, therefore, ask me about its details and about how to keep safe from it, so that you may be able to manage your defense when the time comes\.” This meaning is supported by the successive sayings of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) which

he uttered with regard to the unknown and to which future events did, indeed, testify\. Thus, Ibn Abul Hadid comments on this claim of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) as follows:

“Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s claim is also supported by his statements about future events which he uttered not once or a hundred times but continuously and successively\. From them, there remains no doubt that whatever he spoke was on the basis of knowledge and certainty, not by chance” \(Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 13, p\. 106\)\.

With regard to this saying of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), it has

already been demonstrated and explained \(in Sermon 92, Footnote 2\) that no one else dared advance such a claim, and those who made such a claim had to face only disgrace and humility\. About the prophecies made by Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), see Ibn Abul\-Hadid’s Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha,

Vol\. 7, pp\. 47\-51; judge Nurullah al\-Mar’ashi’s Ihqaq al\-Haqq \(New ed\.\), Vol\. 8, pp\. 87\-182\.
