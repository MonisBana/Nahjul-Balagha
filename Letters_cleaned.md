**Letter 1**

**Addressed to the people of Kufa at the time of his march from Medina to Basra \.**

From the servant of Allah, Ali, the Commander of the Faithful, to the people of Kufa who are the foremost among the supporters and the chiefs of the Arabs\.

I am reminding you of what happened to Othman so that its memory may be like seeing its events\. People criticized him, and I was the only man from among the Muhajirun \(immigrants\) to ask him to make it his pursuit to please \(the Muslims\) the most and to offend them the very least\. As for Talhah and az\-Zubayr, their lightest step about him was hard, and their softest voice was strong\. Aisha, too, was angry with him\. Consequently, a group overpowered him and killed him\. Then, people swore allegiance to me, not by force or compulsion, but obediently and out of their free will\.

You should know that Medina has been vacated by its residents who have abandoned it\. It is boiling like a huge cauldron and rebellion is fixed on its axis, moving with full force\. So, hasten towards your amir \(commander\) and proceed forward to fight your enemy, if Allah, to Whom Might and Majesty belong, so wills\.

Ibn Maythmam writes \(in Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 4, p\. 338\) that when on hearing about themischief\-mongering of Talhah and az\-Zubayr, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) set off for Basra\. He sent this letter

to the people of Kufa through Imam al\-Hassan and Ammar ibn Yasir from \[the town of\] al\-Maa’al\-Adhb, while ibn Abul\-Hadid has written \(in Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 14, pp\. 8, 16; al\-Tabari, Vol\. 1, p\. 3139, and ibn al\-Athir, Vol\. 3, p\. 223\) that when Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) camped at ar\-Rabadha, he sent this letter through Muhammad ibn Ja\`far

<a id="page734"></a>ibn Abu Talib and Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr\. In this letter, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) clearly sheds a light on the point that the assassination of

Othman was the result of the efforts of Aisha, Talhah and az\-Zubayr, and that it was they who played a major role in it\. In fact, Aisha went beyond her bounds and exposed his shortcomings in public meetings, ordering that he should be killed\. Thus, Shaikh Muhammad Abdo has written the following: “Once, Othman was on the pulpit when Umm al\-Mu’minin \[mother of the faithful\] Aisha took out the shoes and the shirt of the Prophet \(h\) from under her outer covering mantle and said the following:

‘These are the shoes of the Messenger of Allah and his shirt\. They have not yet decayed while you have altered his religion and changed his Sunnah\.’ Upon this, heated words were exchanged between them following which she said, ‘Kill this Na’thal’, likening Othman with a known long\-bearded Jew \(of that name\)” \(Nahjul\-Balagha, printed in Egypt, Vol\. 2, p\. 3; also see Ansab al\-Ashraf, Vol\. 5, p\. 88; Abul\-Fida’, Vol\. 1, p\. 172\)\.

People were already displeased with Othman, so this event increased their boldness\. They, hence, surrounded his mansion so that he might mend his ways or abdicate from the caliphate\. In these circumstances, there was serious apprehension that if he did not accept either of the two alternatives, he would be killed\. All this was observed by Aisha, but she paid no heed to it and, leaving him under siege, she decided to leave Medina for Mecca\. On this occasion, Marwan ibn al\-Hakam \[her cousin\] and Attab ibn As d said the following to her, “If you postpone your departure, it is possible his \[‘Othman’s\] life may be saved and this crowd \[laying siege around his mansion\] may disperse,” whereupon she said that she had decided to go for hajj and that that could not be changed\. It was then that Marwan recited this couplet by way of a proverb:

Qays set fire to my cities, and when they were ablaze, He slipped away, saving himself clear of it\.

Similarly, Talhah and az\- Zubayr were also very angry with him and they were in the vanguard of those fanning this fire, intensifying the opposition to his caliphate\. From this angle, they were, to a great extent, taking part in the assassination and were responsible for shedding his blood\. Other people also knew them in this light and regarded them as his murderers, while their supporters, too, were not able to offer any explanation \(for absolving them\)\. Thus, Ibn Qutaybah writes that when al\-Mughrah ibn Shu’bah met Aisha at Awtas, he asked her the following

<a id="page735"></a>question: “O Umm al\-Mu’minin\! Where are you bound for?” She replied, “I am going to Basra\.” He inquired for what purpose and she replied, “To avenge Othman’s murder\.” He said, “But his assassins are with you\!” Then he turned to Marwan and inquired where he was going\. He replied that he, too, was going to Basra\. He inquired about the purpose and the reply was: “To avenge Othman’s murder\.” Then he again said, “\`Othman’s assassins are with you\. These Talhah and az\-Zubayr have killed him” \(Al\-Imama wal\-Siyasa, Vol\. 1, p\. 60\)\.

In any case, when, after laying the blame on Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), this group that had killed \`Othman reached Basra, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) also rose to quell this mischief; he wrote this letter to the

people of Kufa to solicit their support\. Upon this, their combatants and warriors rose in large numbers and enlisted in his army\. They faced the enemy with full courage which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) also acknowledged\. Thus, the letter hereafter is in acknowledgment\.

**Letter 2**

**Written to the People of Kufa after the Victory in Basra**

May Allah reward you, townsmen \(of Kufa\), on behalf of a member of your Prophet’s family, with the best reward that He bestows on those who act in obedience to Him and on those who thank Him for His bounties\. Surely, you heard \(me\) and obeyed, and when you were called upon, you promptly responded\.

**Document 3**

**Written to Shurayh ibn al\-Harith \(al\-Kindi\), Kufa’s Judge**

It is related that Shurayh ibn al\-Harith \(al\-Kindi\), who was Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s Qadi \(judge\) of Kufa, during his tenure, bought a house for eighty dinars\. When it became known to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), he sent for him saying:

I have come to know that you have purchased a house for eighty dinars and that you have written a document \[deed of ownership\] for it and put testimony on it\.”

<a id="page736"></a>Shurayh replied, “Yes, O Imam ibn Abu Talib; it is so\.” Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) cast an angry look at him and said:

O Shurayh, beware, shortly one person \(the angel of death\) will come to you who will not look at the document, nor will he question you about your testimony but take you out of it far away and deposit you in your grave quite alone\. Look, O Shurayh\! If you have purchased this house from money other than yours, or paid the price from an unlawful source, you have incurred on your soul the loss of this world as well as of the next\. If you had come to me at the time of purchase, I would have written for you a document on this paper, then you would have liked to purchase the house even for one dirham, not to speak of more\. That document is this:

This is about a purchase made by a humble slave \(of Allah\) from another slave ready to depart \(for the next world\) \. He has purchased a house out of houses of deceit in the area of mortals and in the neighborhood of mortals\. This house has four boundaries as follows: The first boundary is contiguous to sources of calamities; the second boundary adjoins the sources of distress; the third boundary adjoins devastating desires, and the fourth boundary adjoins deceitful Satan, and it is towards this that the door of this house opens\. This house has been purchased by one who has been waylaid by desires from one who is being driven by death at the price of leaving the honor of contentment and entering into the humility of want and submissiveness\. If the buyer encounters some \(evil\) consequences of this transaction, then it is for the one who dismantles the bodies of monarchs, snatches the lives of despots, destroys the domain of Pharaohs, Kisras200, Caesars201, Tubbas202 and Himyars203

200“Kisra” is the Arabized word of Khusraw \[Khosroe\] which means “a king whose domain extends to a vast area”\. This was the title of the rulers of then Persia\.

201“Caesar” was one of the rulers of Rome\. In Latin, it means the child whose mother dies before delivery and who is extracted by cutting her body open\. Since among the Kings of Rome, Augustus was born like this, he was known by this name\. Thereafter, this word was adopted as the title of every ruler\.

202“Tubba’” is an appellation of each of the Kings of Yemen who had Himyar and Hadramawt under his control\. Their names have been mentioned in the Holy Quran in 44:37 and 50:14\.

203Himyar was an important tribe in the ancient Sabaen kingdom of south\-western Arabia\. Later in time, its kings were the powerful rulers of much of southern Arabia from c\. 115 BC to c\. AD 525\. The Himyarites were concentrated in the area known as Thu Raydan \(later called Qataban\) on the

<a id="page737"></a>and all those who amass wealth upon wealth and go on increasing it, who build high houses and decorate them and collect treasures and preserve them, as they claimed according to their own thinking, for children to take them to the place of accounting and judgement and the status of reward and punishment\. “When the verdict will be passed those who stood on falsehood will then be the losers” \(Holy Quran, 40: 78\)\.

This document is appreciated by intelligence when free from the shackles of desire and from the adornments of this world\.

**Letter 4**

**To One of the Officers of His Army**

If they204 return to the umbrella of obedience, then this is all that we want\. But if the condition of these people points out towards disruption and disobedience, then, taking with you those who obey you, you must rush against those who disobey you\. While you have those with you who follow you, do not worry about those who hold back from you because the absence of a half\-hearted man is better than his presence, and his sitting down is better than his rising\.

coast of present\-day Yemen\. Thus, they were probably aided in the overthrow of their Sabaean \[or Sabian\] kinsmen by the discovery of a sea route from Egypt to India which deprived the inland Sabaean kingdom of its former importance as a center for offshore trade\. The Himyarites \(classical Homeritae\) inherited the Sabaean language and culture and from their capital at Zafar, their power at times extended eastward as far as the Persian Gulf and northward into the Arabian Desert\. At the beginning of the 4th century AD, the Himyarite capital was moved northward to San’a\. Later in the same century, both Christianity and Judaism gained firm footholds in the area\. Internal disorders and changing trade routes caused the kingdom to decline\. In 525 AD, after several unsuccessful attempts, Abyssinian invaders finally crushed the Himyarites\. A Himyar appeal to Peria for aid led to Persian control in 575 AD\. \(_The New Encyclopedia_ _Britannica _\[Micropaedia\] Vol\. 5, p\. 49, ed\. 1973\-1974\)\.

204When \`Othman ibn Hunayf, Governor of Basra, informed Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) of the arrival of Talhah and az\-Zubayr at Basra and of their

intentions, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) wrote this letter to him\. In it, he

instructed him that in case the enemy was bent on fighting and he had to face it, he should not enlist on his side those who on the one hand showed consideration for the personalities of \`\}’isha, Talhah and az\-Zubayr and who, on the other hand, had agreed to fight against them merely by persuasion because such people could not be expected to fight steadfastly nor could then be depended

<a id="page738"></a>**Letter 5**

**To al\-Ash\`ath ibn Qays \(al\-Kindi\), Governor of Azerbaijan**

Certainly, your assignment is not a morsel for you, but it is a trust round your neck, and you have been charged with the protection \(of the people\) on behalf of your superiors\. It is not for you to be oppressive towards the subjects, nor to put your life at risk save on strong grounds\. You have in your hands the funds which are the property of Allah to Whom belong Might and Majesty, and you hold its charge till you pass it on to me\. Probably I will not be one of the bad rulers for you, and this is the end of the matter\.

When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) was through with the Battle of

Jamal, he wrote to al\-Ash\`ath ibn Qays \(al\-Kindi\), who had been the Governor of Azerbaijan since the days of Othman, to send the revenue and levies of his province to him \[in Kufa\]\. But since al\-Ash’ath had fears about the future of his status and assignment, he intended to pocket all this money like other officers appointed by Othman\. Therefore, as soon as this letter reached him, he sent for his chief associates\. Having mentioned this letter to them, he said the following: “I fear that this money will be taken away from me; I, therefore, intend to join Mu\`awiyah\.” It was then that those people said that it was a matter of shame to leave the kith and kin and to seek refuge with Mu\`awiyah\. Consequently, on the advice of those people, he postponed the implementation of his idea to run away, but he did not agree to part with the money\. On getting this information, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) sent Hijr ibn Adiy al\-Kindi to bring the man

to him to Kufa\. He persuaded him and brought him to Kufa\. On reaching there, his kit was found to contain four hundred thousand Dirhams out of which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) left thirty thousand for the man and deposited the rest in the public treasury\.

**Letter 6**

**To Mu\`awiyah \(ibn Abu Sufyan\)**

Verily, those who swore allegiance to Abu Bakr, Umar and Othman have sworn allegiance to me on the same basis on which they swore allegiance to them\. Whoever was present had no choice \(to

upon\. Rather, such people will try to discourage others, too\. Therefore, it was only good to ignore such people\.

<a id="page739"></a>consider\), and whoever was absent had no right to reject, and consultation was confined to the Muhajirun and the Ansar\. If they agree on an individual and take him to be the Caliph, it will be deemed to imply seeking Allah’s pleasure\. If anyone keeps away by way of demonstrating his objection or for innovation, they will return him to the status from where he kept away\. If he refuses, they will fight him for following a course other than that of the believers, and Allah will put him back from where he had run away\. By my life, O Mu\`awiyah, if you see with your brain without any passion, you will find me the most innocent of all with regard to Othman’s blood, and you will surely know that I was in seclusion from him, unless you conceal what is quite open to you\. Then you may commit an outrage \(on me\) as you like, and that is the end of the matter\.

When all the people of Medina swore allegiance to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), Mu\`awiyah refused to go along, fearing his own power

being jeopardized and to contest Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s caliphate\. He concocted the excuse that it had not been agreed upon unanimously and that, therefore, after canceling it, there should be another general election, although the caliphate from which \(the process of\) election was started was the result of a timely situation\. There was no question about the common vote so it could be called the result of the people’s election\. Rather, it was imposed on the people and assumed to be their verdict\. From then, it became a principle that whoever the nobles of Medna elected will be deemed to represent the entire world of Islam; nobody would be allowed to question it, whether he was present at the time of election or not\. In any case, after the establishment of this principle, Mu\`awiyah had no right to propose a re \-election nor to refuse the swearing of allegiance when he had in practice recognized these caliphates which, it was alleged, had been settled by the important people of Medina\. That is why when he alleged this election was unbinding, refusing to swear allegiance, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) pointed out to

him the \(recognized\) way of election and smashed his argument\. It was a method known as arguing with the adversary on the basis of his wrong premises so as to refute his argument, since Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

never at any stage regarded consultation \(with the chiefs\) or the common vote to be the criterion of validity of the caliphate\. Otherwise, with regard to the caliphate, about which it is alleged that they were based on the unanimity of the Muhajirun and the Ansar, he would have regarded that unanimity of vote as a sound authority, holding it as valid\. But his refusal of the swearing of allegiance in the very first period, which could not be denied by anyone, is a proof of the fact that he did not regard these self\-

<a id="page740"></a>concocted methods as the criterion of \(validity of\) the caliphate\. That is why at all times he continued pressing his own case for the caliphate, which was also established on the basis of the Prophet’s statements and actions\. However, to place it before Mu\`awiyah meant opening the door to questions and answers\. He, therefore, attempted to convince him of his own premises and beliefs so that there could be no scope for interpretation nor for confusing the matter\. In fact, the real objective of Mu\`awiyah was to prolong the matter so that at some point his own authority might gain some support\.

**Letter 7**

**To Mu\`awiyah**

I have received from you the packet of unconnected pieces of advice and an embellished letter\. You have written it because of your misguidance and dispatched it because of your lack of wisdom\. This is the letter of a man who has neither light to show him the way nor a leader to guide him on the right path\. Passion prompted him and he responded to it\. Misguidance led him and he followed it\. Consequently, he began to speak nonsense and went recklessly astray\.

**An Excerpt from the Same Letter:**

Because allegiance is once and for all, it is not open for reconsideration, nor is there any scope for fresh proceedings of an election\. Whoever remains out of it is deemed to be critical of Islam, while whoever remains argumentative about it is a hypocrite\.

**Letter 8**

**To Jarir Ibn Abdillah Al\-bajali When Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Sent Him to Mu\`awiyah \(And There Was a Delay in His Return\)**

When you receive this letter of mine, you must ask Mu\`awiyah to take a final decision and to follow a determined course\. Then ask him to choose either war that exiles him from home or a dishonorable peace\. If he chooses war, leave him alone, but if he chooses peace, secure an oath of allegiance from him, and that is an end to the matter**\.**

<a id="page741"></a>**Letter 9**

**To Mu\`awiyah**

Our people \(the tribesmen of Quraish\) decided to kill our Prophet \(h\) and to uproot us\. They caused us many worries, behaved with us

harshly, denied us the ease of life, exposed us to fear, forced us to seek refuge in a rugged mountain and ignited for us the flames of war\.

Allah then gave us determination to protect His religion and defend His honor\. The believers among us expected \(heavenly\) rewards from so doing, and the unbelievers among us gave their support because of kinship\. Those who accepted Islam from among the tribesmen of Quraish were away from the distresses in which we were involved either because of a pledge that protected them or because of the tribe that would rise to support them\. They were, therefore, safe from being killed\. The way with the Prophet \(h\) was that when fighting became fierce and

people began to lose ground, he would send forward members of his family and through them protect his companions from the attacks with swords and spears\. In this way, \`Ubaydah ibn al\-Harith was killed on the Day of Badr, Hamzah \(ibn \`Abdul\-Muttalib\) on the Day of Uhud, and Ja\`far \(ibn Abu Talib\) on the Day of Mu’tah\. One more person, whom I can name if I wish, desired to seek martyrdom as they did, but their deaths approached, while his had not\.

How strange it is that I am being grouped with him who never had a briskness of pace like mine, nor had he, to his credit, any achievement like mine unless he claims something of which I do not know\. In any case, all praise belongs to Allah\.

As regarding your request to hand over to you the murderers of Othman, I have contemplated over this matter and I do not find that handing them over to you or to someone else is possible for me\. By my life, if you do not give up your wrong ways and disruptive deeds, you would surely know them\. They would shortly be seeking you and would not give you the trouble of seeking them on land, sea, mountains or plains\. But this search would be painful for you and their visit would not give you happiness\. Peace be on those whoever deserves it\.

When the Messenger of Allah \(k\) was commanded \(by Allah\) to

call people to \(believe in\) the Unity of Allah, the powers of unbelief and disobedience stood up to block the way of truthfulness and the tribes of

<a id="page742"></a>Quraish decided to quell this voice through coercion and force\. Love for their idols was so strong in the hearts of these unbelievers, they were not prepared to hear a single word against them\. The idea of one God was enough to rouse their passions\. In addition, they were made to hear such epithets about their gods that gave them no better status than lifeless stones\. When they realized that their principles and beliefs were in jeopardy, they prepared themselves to trouble the Prophet \(h\)\. They got

ready to try every means to reach that end\. They adopted such pain\-inflicting devices \(against the Prophet \[h\]\) that it was impossible for him

to step out of his house\. Those who had accepted Islam during this period, too, had to face continuous tribulations\. For example, these adherents to such beliefs were often placed on the burning ground, under the parching sun, and beaten with straps and stones till they lost their consciousness\. When the atrocities of the tribesmen of Quraish rose to this extent, the Prophet \(h\) permitted such adherents to leave Mecca and immigrate to

Abyssinia in the fifth year since his call to Prophethood\. The tribesmen of Quraish followed them there as well, but the ruler of Abyssinia refused to hand the believers over to them\. Through his fairness and justice, he did not permit any trouble to befall them\.

On the other side of the sea, the Prophet’s preaching continued\. The magnetism and influence of truth was producing its effect\. People were impressed by his teachings and personality\. They came into his fold as a result of which the tribesmen of Quraish felt much perturbed, so they tried to stop this increasing influence and power\. When they could not do anything, they decided to sever all ties with Banu Hashim and BanÅ Abdul\-Muttalib, to have no social contacts with them, and to have no transactions with them, perhaps they would be forced to give up supporting the Prophet \(h\), then they would deal with him as they

pleased\. Consequently, they concluded a mutual agreement about it, and a document was written on the subject and was deposited safely\. After this agreement, although the locality was the same and the inhabitants, too, were the same, yet for Banu Hashim every nook and corner became strange and well\-known faces turned as if they had never known each other\. All of them turned their faces and stopped mutual meetings and contacts\. In these circumstances, there was also the apprehension that the Prophet \(h\) might be attacked suddenly in a valley outside the city\. For

this reason, they were forced to take refuge in a place called Shi’b \(quarter\) of Abu Talib\. At this stage, those Banu Hashim who had not yet accepted Islam shared these privations on account of lineal kinship and offered defence at the hour of need, while those who had accepted Islam,

<a id="page743"></a>such as Hamzah and Abu Talib, were actively protecting the Prophet \(h\) as their religious obligation\. In particular, Abu Talib had given up all his ease and comfort, spending his days consoling the Prophet \(h\) and his nights changing his bed from one place to another\. Thus, if the Prophet \(h\) used a bed one night, the next night Ali was to sleep in it, so that in case someone attacked, Ali should suffer the brunt instead\.

This was a period of great privation and trouble for Banu Hashim\. If they could get leaves of trees to eat, that was enough for them; otherwise, they had to near their starvation\. After the lapse of three years in these hardships, Zuhayr ibn Abu Umayyah \(whose mother was ‘Atika daughter of Abdul\-Muttalib\), Hisham ibn Amr ibn Rabi\`ah \(who had a family maternal kinship with Banu Hashim\), al\-Mut’im ibn \`Adiy ibn Nawfal ibn Abd Manaf, Abul\-Bakhtari al\-As ibn Hisham ibn al \-Mughirah and Zama’ah ibn al\- Aswad ibn al\-Muttalib proposed that this agreement should be abrogated\. For a discussion of this issue, the chiefs from among the tribesmen of Quraish assembled in the precincts of the Ka\`ba\. No decision had yet been taken when Abu Talib came out of the Valley and joined them\. He said to them, “My nephew Muhammad \(h\) has told me

that the paper on which this agreement was written has been eaten by white\-ants and nothing in it has remained save the name of Allah\. So, you should send for the document and see it\. If he is correct, then you should give up your animosity, and if he is wrong, I am ready to hand him over to you\.” The document was brought and examined\. It was, indeed, a fact that with the exception of the words “In Your name, O God”, written on the top of all documents in those days, the rest of it had been eaten away by white\- ants\. Seeing this, al\-Mut’im ibn \`Adiy tore off the writing; thus, this cruel agreement was abrogated\. At last, Banu Hashim abandoned the life of oppression and helplessness\. But even after this, there was no change in the unbelievers’ behavior towards the Prophet \(h\)\. Rather,

they were so keen in their enmity and malice against him that they started thinking of taking his life away\. Consequently, the great event of Hijra \(migration of the Holy Prophet \[h\] from Mecca to Medina\) took place\.

Although on this occasion Abu Talib was no longer alive, Ali represented him by lying down on the Prophet’s bed; it was the lesson taught by Abu Talib through which he managed to protect the Holy Prophet’s life\.

Although these events were not unknown to Mu\`awiyah, yet by recounting to him the deeds of his predecessors, the intention was to awaken his malicious spirit\. Therefore, his attention has been drawn to the hardships inflicted \(on the Holy Prophet \[h\] and his adherents\) by the

<a id="page744"></a>tribesmen of Quraish, especially Banu Abd Shams, so that he might see the conduct of each of the followers of the truth and the followers of falsehood would then realize that he himself was treading on the right path or just following his forefathers\.

**Letter 10**

**To Mu\`awiyah**

What would you do when the coverings of this world in which you are wrapped are removed from you? The world attracted you with its embellishments and deceived you with its pleasures\. It called you, and you responded to it\. It led you, and you followed it\. It commanded you, and you obeyed it\. Shortly an informer will inform you of things against which there will be no shield \(to protect you\)\. Therefore, keep off from this affair, take heed of the accounting \(on the Day of Judgement\), get ready for death that will soon overtake you, and do not lend your ears to those who have gone astray\. If you do not do so, I shall recall to you whatever you have forgotten because you are a man living in ease and luxury205\. Satan has taken you in his clutches, secured his wishes in you and taken complete control of you like your soul and blood\.

O Mu\`awiyah\! When were you ever a protector of the subjects and a guardian of the affairs of the people without granting some people distinction \(over others\)? We seek Allah’s protection against the befalling of previous misfortunes, and I warn you lest you should continue being deceived by desires and your outer appearance becomes different from your inner self\.

You have called me to war\. It is better if you left the people on one side and you yourself came out to meet me \(on the battleifield\) and thus spare both our parties having to fight\. It will then be known which one of us has a rusted heart and covered eyes\. I am the father of al\-Hassan who killed your grandfather \(\`Utbah ibn Rab\`ah\), your brother \(Hanzalah ibn Abu Sufyan\) and your uncle \(Al\-Walid ibn \`Utbah\) by cutting them to pieces on the day of Badr\. The same sword is with me, and I meet my adversary with the same heart\. I have not altered the religion, nor do I follow any new prophet\. I am surely treading on that very highway which you had willingly forsaken then was forced to adopt\.

205This is in reference to the following verse: “We sent no warner into any city except that its men who lived in ease \(and luxury\) said, ‘We disbelieve in the message with which you have been sent’” \(Holy Quran, 34: 34\)\.

<a id="page745"></a>You think that you have come out seeking revenge for Othman’s blood\. Certainly, you know how Othman’s blood was shed\. If you want to avenge it, avenge it there\. It is as though I see that when war is cutting you with its teeth, you cry like camels moaning under heavy loads\. And it is as though I see your party bewildered by the incessant striking of the swords, the occurrence of death, and the falling of bodies after bodies, calling me towards the Holy Quran although they would themselves be either unbelievers, deniers of the truth or renegades of allegiance after having sworn it\.

This previous prediction of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) is about

the battle of Siffin\. Herein, he has depicted the whole picture in very few words\. Thus, on one side Mu\`awiyah was bewildered on account of the attacks of the Iraqis and was thinking to run away while, on the other, his army was crying under the constant onslaught of death\. Eventually, when there was no way to escape, they raised the Holy Quran on the spears and shouted for peace\. By this device, the remaining persons saved their lives\.

This prediction, as ibn Abul\-Hadid al\-Mu’tazili says, “is either a true prophetic keen eye of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), which signifies a

great power, or it is an information through knowledge of the unknown \(ilmul\-ghayb\) which is the most significant and wonderful\. However, both cases are in the state of extreme significance and beauty\.

Ibn Abul\-Hadid has further quoted the same prediction from other letters of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) to Mu\`awiyah \(Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 15, pp\. 83\-85\)\.

This prediction cannot be attributed to imagination, to guessing or to the drawing of inference from events, nor can these details be ascertained by wit or far\-sightedness\. Only he could disclose them whose source of information is either the Prophet’s own revelation\-bearing tongue or the Divine inspiration\.

**Instruction 11**

**Given to the Contingent Sent to Confront an Enemy**

When you proceed towards your enemy, the status of your force should be on the approaches of high grounds or edges of mountains or bends of rivers, so that it may serve you as a place to return to\. Your encounter should be from one side or from two\. Position scouts on the

<a id="page746"></a>peaks of mountains and the raised sides of the high ground so that the enemy may not approach you from any place, whether of danger or of safety\. And be admonished that the vanguard of an army serves as their eyes and the eyes of the vanguard are their informers\. Beware of dispersal\. When you halt, do so collectively, and when you move, you should move together\. When night comes, fix your spears in a circle and do not sleep except for dosing or napping\.

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) put Ziyad ibn an\-Nadr al\-Harithi and

Shurayh ibn Hani al\-Harithi in command of contingents of eight thousand and four thousand strong at the camp of an\-Nukhayla, ordering them to advance towards Syria\. A dispute arose then between them about their ranks\. They informed Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) of it and wrote letters

of complaints about each other\. In reply, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

wrote to them that when they marched jointly, the command of the joint force would be with Ziyad ibn an \-Nadr al\-Harithi, and if they marched separately, each commander would be in charge of his own force\.

In this letter, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) also wrote certain

instructions for them\. Here, Sayyid ar\-Radi takes down only the portion containing the instructions\. These instructions are not only useful as regards the strategies of fighting in those days, but their utilization and importance in bringing out the principles of fighting in our days as well is undeniable\. These instructions are: At the time of encounter with the enemy forces, the assailants should camp on tops of mountains and curves of rivers\. This way, the low areas of the rivers would serve as trenches and the peaks of mountains as the walls of the fortress; thus, it would be possible to feel secure and face the enemy from the other side\. Secondly, the attack should be from one side or at the most from two because by distributing the entire force on several fronts, weakness would be inevitable\. Thirdly, the scouts should be placed on the tops of high grounds and the peaks of mountains so that they may give a warning of any attack\. Sometimes, it happens that instead of attacking from the expected side, the enemy attacks from a different one\. Therefore, if posses are on high places, they will detect the enemy from the cloud of dust seen from a distance\.

To clarify the useful aspect of these instructions, Ibn Abul\-Hadid has recorded \(in Vol\. 15, p\. 91\) a historical incident that when Qahtabah \(ibn Shabib at\-Ta’i\) camped in a village after leaving Khurasan, he and Khalid ibn Barmak went and sat on the top of a nearby hill\. No sooner had they sat down than Khalid noticed flocks of deer coming running

<a id="page747"></a>from the forest\. On seeing this he said to Qahtabah, “O Commander\! Stand and announce to the army that they should at once fall in line and take up arms\.” Hearing this, Qahtabah was startled\. He stood up\. Looking hither and thither, he said, “I do not see the enemy’s men anywhere\.” He replied, “O Amir\! This is not the time that should be lost in any conversation\. You have seen how these deer are proceeding towards the people, leaving their abodes\. This means that the enemy’s army is marching from the rear\.” Consequently, the commander ordered his army to get ready\. As soon as the army got ready, the noise of the horses’ hoofs was heard and within moments the enemy was on them\. Since they had prepared themselves for defence in time, they defended themselves against the enemy thoroughly\. Now, if Khalid had not been at such a height and had not acted with such sagacity, the enemy would have attacked them as they were unaware of the attack and annihilated them\. Fourthly, the reconnaissance should be spread here and there, so that they can be aware of the movements and intentions of the enemy and thereby foil his plans\. Fifthly, when the army camps, it should camp together, and when it moves, it should move together, so that the enemy does not attack you in a state of dispersal and overpowers you easily\. Sixthly, at night, the guard should be formed by fixing spears in a circle in the ground so that if the enemy attacks during the night, it is possible to prepare for defense by taking up arms at once, and if the enemy showers arrows, that, too, can be dealt with\. Seventhly, deep sleep should be avoided lest you should become unaware of the enemy’s approach and the latter would succeed in attacking you before you get ready\.

**Instruction 12**

**Given to Ma\`qil Ibn Qays ar\-Riyahi as He Was Dispatched to Syria at the Command of a Vanguard Contingent of Three Thousand Strong\.**

<a id="page748"></a>Fear Allah before Whom attendance is inevitable and with other than Whom there is no meeting\. Do not fight except those who fight you\. Travel in the two cool periods \(i\.e\. morning and evening\)\. Let the men have a midday sleep\. March easily and do not travel during the early night for Allah has made it for resting and has ordained it for staying, not for journeying\. Therefore, give rest to your body in the night and let your beasts of burden also rest\. When you are sure that the morning has approached, and when dawn has drawn nigh, start your journey with Allah’s blessings\. If you face the enemy, stand in the midst of your comrades\. Do not get too near to the enemy like one who wants to commence the fighting, nor should you remain too distant like one who is afraid of action, till you receive my orders\. Hatred for them should not lead you to fight before inviting them \(to guidance\) and exhausting your pleas before them\.

**Letter 13**

**To Two Officers in His Army**

1. have placed Malik1 ibn al\-Harith al\-Ashtar in command over you and over all those under you\. Therefore, follow his commands and take him as the armour and shield for yourselves because he is one of those from whom I have no fear of weakness nor any mistake, nor laziness where haste is more appropriate,nor haste where slackness is expected of him\.

When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) sent a vanguard contingent of

twelve thousand strong under the command of Ziyad ibn an\-Nadr al\-Harithi and Shurayh ibn Hani al\-Harithi to Syria, on the way, near Sur ar\-Rum, they encountered “Abul\-Awar” Amr ibn Sulayman al\-Salami who was camping there with a Syrian contingent\. Both of them informed Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) of this through al\-Harith ibn Jumhan al\-Ju’fi,

whereupon the Imam \(x\) sent Malik ibn al\-Harith al\-Ashtar as the Officer\-in\-Command and wrote this letter to notify them\. The brief but comprehensive words in which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) refers to

Malik al \-Ashtar in this letter gives an indication of his intelligence, sagacity, courage, daring, expanse and versatility in the art of war as well as his own personal greatness\.

<a id="page749"></a>

**Instruction 14**

**To the Army Before the Encounter with the Enemy at Siffin**

Do not fight them unless they start the fighting because, by the grace of Allah, you are right, and to leave them till they begin fighting will be another point from your side against them\. If, by the will of Allah, the enemy is defeated, do not kill those who flee away, do not strike a helpless person, do not finish off the wounded and do not inflict pain on women even though they may attack your honor with filthy words and abuse your officers because they are weak in character, mind and intelligence\. We have been ordered to avoid them although they may be unbelievers\. Even in pre \-Islamic \(jahiliyya\) period, if a man struck a woman with a stone or a stick, he was rebuked along with his posterity after him\.\.

The responsibility for the war and fighting that took place between Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and Mu\`awiyah lies solely on Mu\`awiyah because the latter brought about the war by laying the blame for Othman’s blood on Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) erroneously, although

the facts about the causes of Othman’s killing and by whom he was killed were not unknown to Mu\`awiyah\. But since there was no way for him to achieve his objective save by creating an excuse for war, he started the war in order to retain his illegitimate authority\. This evidently was offensive\. It cannot by any means be considered as permissible because rebellion and rebellion against the rightful Imam is unlawful according to the general consensus of Muslims\. Thus, “Abu Zakariyya” Yahya ibn Sharaf an\-Nawawi \(631/1233 \- 676/1277\) writes the following: “Do not fight those in authority with regard to matters of governing, nor should you raise objections against them except when you observe them committing things which you know are definitely against Islam\. If you see them doing such things, regard it as bad for them and speak the truth wherever you may be\. But rising against them or fighting them is prohibited by the consensus of Muslims \(Sharh Sahih Muslim, Vol\. 2, p\. 125\)\. In agreement with this view, see also: judge Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn at\-Tayyib al\-Baqillani \[338/950 \- 403/1013\], the Ash\`arite great scholar, in Al\-Tamhid, p\. 186, and Sa\`d ad\-Din Mas\`ud ibn Umar at\-Taftazani \[712/1312 \- 793/1390\] in Sharh al\-Maqasid, Vol\. 2, p\. 272\.

Muhammad ibn \`Abdul\-Karm al\-Shahristani writes the following: “Whoever rises against the true Imam, according the unanimous view of the \(Muslim\) community, is known as a Kharijite,

<a id="page750"></a>deviator\. The same is the case of rising, during the days of the companions, against the rightful imams, or even after them against those who followed them in virtue \(Al\-Milal wal Nihal, Vol\. 1, p\. 114\)\.

There is no doubt that the action of Mu\`awiyah’s was the result of his rebellion\. To take up arms for the purpose of stopping the advance of the one who rebellions is not against any code of peace or against the conduct of peace \-loving people\. Rather, it is a natural right of the oppressed\. And if one is deprived of this right, then there will remain no way to prevent oppression and tyranny or the safeguarding of rights in the world\. This is why Allah has permitted taking up arms against rebels\. Thus, Allah says the following: “And if two parties of the believers fall into a quarrel, restore peace between them both; but if one of the two transgresses against the other, \(then\) fight that which transgresses till it complies with the command of Allah\. And if it complies, restore peace between the two with justice and deal justly; verily, Allah loves the just ones” \(Holy Quran, 49: 9\)\.

It was the first plea to which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) pointed

out by saying, “By the Grace of Allah, you are right\.” But even after exhausting this plea, he prevented his army from taking the initiative to fight because he wished that the initiative should not be from his side and that he should take up the sword only in self\-defense\. Consequently, when all his effort for peace proved futile, and when the enemy took the first step towards war, this was the second argument in their own favor after which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) could not be blamed for getting

fighting nor be accused of taking an aggressive action\. It was rather an obligation to stop oppression and tyranny that he had to discharge and which Allah has permitted in clear words\. Thus, Allah’s command is that: “Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you but do not be aggressive for verily Allah does not love the aggressors” \(Holy Quran, 2: 190\)\.

Besides, fighting Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) meant fighting the Prophet \(h\) according to the Prophet’s saying: “O Ali\! Your peace is my

peace and your war is my war \(Ibn al \-Maghazlii, Al\-Manaqib, p\. 5; Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 18, p\. 24\)\. Thus, whatever punishment should be imposed for fighting the Prophet \(h\) should be for fighting Imam Ali ibn

Abu Talib \(x\)\. For him, whoever wages war against the Prophet \(h\), Allah has laid down the same penalty\.

<a id="page751"></a>To recompense those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive in the land, spreading mischief \(therein\), is only that they be slain or crucified or their hands and feet should be cut off from opposite sides or be banished from the land; This for them shall be the disgrace in this world and for them, in the hereafter, shall be a great torment\. \(Holy Quran, 5: 33\)

Apart from this, the instructions that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

issued with regard to the war, namely that no runner\- away nor the wounded should be assaulted, are so high from the moral point of view that they can be regarded as a sublime specimen of the moral values and high standards of the struggle to promote Islam\. These instructions, then, were not simply confined to mere words\. Rather, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) followed them to the letter, ordering others, too, to follow them

strictly\. He did not, on any occasion, tolerate the chasing of any runner\-away, the attack against the helpless or to assault women\. In fact, on the battlefield of the Jamal war, where the command of the opposite force was in the hands of a woman, he did not change his principle\. After the defeat and the conquering of the foe, he proved his high character, sending Aisha to Medina under due protection\. Had there been someone other than Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), he would have proposed the same

punishment as that which ought to be awarded for making such a step\! Thus, Ibn Abul\-Hadid has written the following: “Had she \[Aisha\] done the same to \(caliph\) Umar as she had done to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\),

spreading rebellion against him among the people, and having the caliph secured victory over her, he would have killed her and cut her into pieces\. But Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) was very forbearing and large\-hearted” \(Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 17, p\. 254\)\.

**Invocation 15**

**By Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) When He Used to Face the**

**Enemy**\.

O Lord\! Hearts are drawn to You, necks are stretching \(towards You\), eyes are fixed \(on You\), steps are in motion and bodies have turned lean\! O Lord\! Hidden animosity has become manifest and the cauldrons of malice are boiling\.

O Lord\! We complain to You of the absence of our Prophet \(h\), the numerousness of our enemy and the diffusion of our passions\.

<a id="page752"></a>“Our Lord\! Decide between us and our people with truth; You are the Best of those who decide” \(Holy Quran, 7: 89\)\.

**Instruction 16**

**He Used to Issue this Instruction to His Followers During Battle Time\.**

The retreat after which return is intended and the withdrawal after which an attack is in view should not make you unhappy\. Do justice with the swords \(allow your swords to do their duties\)\. Keep ready a place for the falling of bodies \(of your foe\); prepare yourselves for hurling strong spears and striking swords with full force, and keep your voices down as doing so keeps cowardice off\.

By the One Who broke open the seed \(for growth\) and created living beings, they had not accepted Islam but had only secured safety \(by verbally professing it\), hiding their lack of faith\. Consequently, when they found helpers for their lack of faith, they disclosed it\.

**Letter 17**

**In Reply to a Letter from Mu\`awiyah\.**

As for your demand to me to \(hand over\) Syria, I cannot give you today what I denied you the day before\. As regarding your statement that the war has eaten up Arabia save its last breath, you should know that those whose right has been eaten up will go to Paradise, whereas those who are wrong shall go to Hell\. As for your equality in war and in \(the numbers of\) men, certainly you cannot be more penetrating in doubtfulness \(of belief\) than I am in certainty \(of belief\), and the people of Syria are not more greedy for this world than the people of Iraq are for the next one\.

As for your saying that both of us are sons of Abd Manaf, it is undoubtedly so, but Umayyah cannot be like Hashim, nor can Harb be like \`Abdul\- Muttalib, nor can Abu Sufyan be like Abu Talib\. The muhajir \(immigrant\) cannot be a match for whoever was set free \(when Mecca fell\), nor can one of a pure descent be a match for one who is adopted, nor the pursuer of truth can be a match to the adherent to wrongdoing, nor can a believer be a match for a hypocrite\.\.\. How bad are the successors who

<a id="page753"></a>go on following their predecessors who have already fallen into the fire of Hell\!

Besides, we also have the distinction of Prophethood among us by virtue of which we subdued the strong and raised up the downtrodden\. When Allah made Arabia enter \(the fold of\) His religion and when the \[Arab\] people submitted to it willingly or unwillingly, you were among those who entered the religion either out of greed or out of fear, at a time when those who had gone first had preceded and when the first Muhajirun had acquired their own distinction\.

Now, do not give Satan have a share in you, nor should you let him have his sway over you, and that is an end of the matter\.

During the battle of Siffin, Mu\`awiyah again considered demanding the province of Syria from Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and

playing such a trick in order to succeed in his schemes\. In this regard, he consulted Amr ibn al\-As\. But the latter did not agree with this idea and said, “O Mu\`awiyah, think a little\! What effect would this writing of yours have on Ali? How can he fall in this trap by your persuasion?” To this, Mu\`awiyah said, “We are all descendants of \`Abd Manaf\. What difference is there between Ali and me that he may score over me and I may not succeed in deceiving him?” \`Amr ibn al\-As said, “If you think so, then write and see \(the outcome\)\.”

Mu\`awiyah, therefore, wrote a letter to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) wherein he made a demand for Syria and also wrote the following: “We are descendants of Abd Manaf\. There is no distinction for one over the other among us\.” Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) wrote this letter in

reply\. He mentioned his own predecessors along with those of Mu\`awiyah, expressing his rejection of the claim of such an equality\. Although the origin of both was the same, and although the paternal chain of both joined at \`Abd Manaf, the progeny of \`Abd Shams was the source of all evil when it came to morality and character, involving itself in heresy and vice\. Contrariwise, the house of Hashim was the one where Allah was worshiped as the only god and where there were no idols\. If the branches growing out of the same root bear both flowers as well as thorns, then both cannot be deemed as equal\. Consequently, it does not need any detailed explanation to argue that Umayyah and Hashim, Harb and Abdul\-Muttalib, and Abu Sufyan and Abu Talib did not match each other from any angle whatever\. This is not denied by any historian or biographer\. In fact, after this reply, even Mu\`awiyah did not dare to refute

<a id="page754"></a>it: After Abd Manaf, it was Hashim alone who possessed conspicuous prestige among the tribesmen of Quraish and the most important positions with relationship to the Ka\`ba, namely the siqaya \(i\.e\. providing water for the pilgrims\) and rifada \(making provisions for the pilgrims\) was assigned to him\. As such, during the time of hajj, one caravan after another used to come and stay with him\. He was such a generous host to them that those who partook of his generosity and benevolence praised him for a long time thereafter\.

The worthy son of this very large \-hearted and courageous father was Abdul\-Muttalib whose name was Shaybah and surname was “Sayyidul\-Batha” \(master of the Mecca Valley\)\. He was the successor to the distinction of Abraham’s line and owner of the greatness and mastership of Quraish\. The high courage and far\-sightedness demonstrated by him before Abraham is a shining star for the family of Abd Manaf\. Abd Manaf was a pearl and Abdul\-Muttalib was the luster of the pearl\.

Abdul\-Muttalib’s son was Abu Talib whose lap served as the cradle for Abdullah’s orphan child and as the place where the Prophet \(h\) was raised\. He raised the Prophet \(h\) in his care, shielding him

against his enemies\. To compare Abu Sufyan, Harb and Umayyah with them or to regard them as their matches is the same as to close one’s eyes to the luster of light and to regard it as darkness\.

After recounting this genealogical difference, the next point of distinction which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) describes is that he himself is a muhajir \(immigrant from Mecca\) while Mu\`awiyah is a taliq \(i\.e\. one of those whose lives the Prophet \[h\] had spared when Mecca fell to the Muslims\)\. Therefore, when the Prophet \(h\) entered Mecca victoriously,

he inquired from the tribesmen of Quraish as to how they thought he would deal with them\. All said that, being a generous son of a generous father, they expected only goodness from him, whereupon the Prophet \(h\) said, “Go away, you have all been spared\.” That is, “You did deserve

to be detained as slaves but, by obligation, you have been set free\.” These spared persons included Mu\`awiyah and Abu Sufyan\. Thus, Ibn Abul\-Hadid and Shaikh Muhammad Abdo have recorded the following note in their annotations to this letter: “Abu Sufyan and Mu\`awiyah were both among the spared ones” \(Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 17, p\. 119; \`Abdoh, Vol\. 3, p\. 17\)\.

<a id="page755"></a>The third point of distinction is that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s lineage is pure and clear and there is no doubtful point anywhere in it\. Contrariwise, Mu\`awiyah has used to the word “taliq”\. Men of letters have given “taliq” this meaning: “One who is attributed to someone who is not his father”\. In this regard, the first doubt entertained about Umayyah is whether he was the son of Abd Shams or simply his slave who began to be known as his son because of having been brought up by him\. Thus, allama al\- Majlisi has related the following from Kamil al\-Bahai: “Umayyah was a Byzantine slave of \`Abd Shams\. When the latter found him intelligent and sagacious, he freed him then adopted him as his son\. The result was that he began to be called ‘Umayyah son of \`Abd Shams’ as Zayd \(ibn Harithah\) was called ‘Zayd ibn Muhammad \(h\)’

before a Quranic verse was revealed \(prohibiting it\)\.”

The second doubt in the Umayyad lineage is whether Harb, who is known as the son of Umayyah, was really his son or simply a slave brought up by him\. In this regard, Ibn Abul\- Hadid has quoted the following from Abul\-Faraj al\-Isbahani’s bookt: “Mu\`awiyah inquired from the lineage expert Daghfal \(Ibn Hanzalah\) whether he had seen Abdul\-Muttalib\. The genealogist replied in the affirmative\. He further inquired how he found him, whereupon Daghfal replied, “He was prestigious, handsome and a man of a broad forehead, while his face bore the brightness of Prophethood\. Then, Mu\`awiyah inquired whether he had seen Umayyah ibn Abd Shams also and he replied that he had seen him, too\. He inquired how he found him, so he replied, “Weak of body, bent stature and blind\.” In front of him was his slave Thakwan who led his life here and there\. Mu\`awiyah said it was his son Abu Amr \(Harb\), whereupon he said, “You say so but the tribesmen of Quraish only know that he was his slave” \(Al\-Aghani, Vol\. 1, p\. 12; Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 17, pp\. 231\-232\)\.

In this regard, the third doubt is about Mu\`awiyah himself\. Thus, Ibn Abul\-Hadid has written that: “Mu\`awiyah’s mother, Hind, led a life of vileness and immorality\.” Az\-Zamakhshari \(Abul\-Qasim Mahmud ibn Umar \[467/1075 \- 538/1144\]\) has written in his book Rabi’ al\-Abrar that Mu\`awiyah’s parentage was traced back to four persons who were: Musafir ibn Abu Amr, Omerah ibn al\-Walid ibn al\-Mughirah, al\-Abbas ibn Abdul\-Muttalib and as\-Sabah \(a singer for Omerah\)” \(Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 1, p\. 336\)\.

The fourth point of distinction is that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has stated that he was always the devotee of what is right while

<a id="page756"></a>Mu\`awiyah was the devotee of wrongdoing\. This fact needs no proof\. The life of Mu\`awiyah was spent in suppressing right and hankering after wrong\. Nowhere is his step seen as advancing the cause of righteousness\.

The fifth distinction is that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) was a

believer whereas Mu\`awiyah was a mischief\- monger and a hypocrite\. Just as there can be no doubt about Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s belief, there can be no doubt about Mu\`awiyah’s mischief\-mongering and hypocricy\. Thus, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has exposed the man’s hypocrisy in the earlier writing of these words\.

These people had not accepted Islam but only secured safety by verbally professing it and had hidden their disbelief\. Consequently, when they found helpers for their mischief, they disclosed it\.

**Letter 18**

**To Abdullah ibn Abbas, his Governor over Basra**

You should know that Basra is the place where Satan descends and mischief takes place\. Keep the people of this place pleased with good treatment and remove the knots of fear from their hearts\.

I have come to know of your strictness and harshness with Banu Tamim206\. Banu Tamim are such that if one star sets, another rises for them\. They were never exceeded in \(the art of\) war in pre\-Islamic times or after Islam\. They have a special kinship with us and a particular

206When Talhah and az\-Zubayr reached Basra, it was Banu Tamim who took active part in the movement to “avenge Othman’s blood” and were in the vanguard of those who were fanning this mischief\. Therefore, when \`Abdullah ibn Abbas took over as the Governor of Basra, in view of their breach of faith and animosity, he thought they deserved to be treated harshly and was to some extent severe with them\. But in this tribe there were also a few sincere followers of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\. When they saw this behavior of Ibn Abbas with

their tribe, they sent a letter to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) through Jariyah ibn Qadamah wherein they complained of Ibn Abbas’s harsh treatment\. Thereupon, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) wrote this letter to Ibn Abbas in which he instructed

him to change his ways and to treat them well, drawing his attention to the kinship between Banu Hashim and Banu Tamim\. That kinship was this: Banu Hashim and Banu Tamim join the lineal line at Ilyas ibn Mudar because Hashim is the descendant of Mudrikah ibn Ilyas, while Tamim is the descendant of Tabikhah ibn Ilyas\.

<a id="page757"></a>relationship\. We shall be rewarded if we pay heed to the tie of kinship and be deemed sinful if we disregard it\. O Abul\-Abbas\! May Allah have mercy on you\! Keep yourself restrained in whatever you say or do, in anything good or bad relevant to your people, as we are both partners in this \(responsibility\)\. Prove yourself according to my good impressions about you, and do not prove my opinion \(about you\) to be wrong, and this is the end of the matter\.

**Letter 19**

**To One of His Officers**

Now, the cultivators207

\[dahaqin, plural of dihqan\] of your city have complained of your strictness, hard\- heartedness, humiliating treatment and harshness\. I thought it over and found that since they are unbelievers, they cannot be brought near nor kept away nor treated severely because of the pledge with them\. Behave with them in\-between strictness and softness, and adopt for them a mingling or remoteness, aloofness with nearness, if Allah so pleases\.

**Letter 20**

**To Ziyad Ibn Abih1,when Abdullah Ibn Abbas Was the Governor of Basra, the Suburbs of Ahwaz, Pars and Kirman, While Ziyad Was His Deputy in Basra\.**

207These people were Magians \(majus, Zoroastrian\)\. This is why the treatment of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s officer of them was not the same as it was with Muslims\. Disgusted with this \[discrimination\], they wrote a letter of complaint to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and spoke of the officer’s harshness\. In

reply, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) wrote to his officer that he should mete out

treatment to them in which there should be neither harshness nor such leniency which they may exploit to creating mischief\. This is so because if they are let loose, they get involved in schemes against the government, thus disturbing the country’s administration by creating one mischief or another, while a wholly repressive policy cannot be justified because they are counted as subjects and their rights as such cannot be ignored\.

208“Ibn Abih” means: “son of his \[unknown\] father”\.

<a id="page758"></a>I truthfully swear by Allah that if I come to know that you have misappropriated the funds of the Muslim, small or big amounts, I shall inflict upon you such punishment that would leave you empty\-handed, heavy backed and humiliated, and that is the end of the matter\.

**Letter 21**

**Also to Ziyad**

Give up luxury and be moderate\. Every day, remember the coming Day \[of Judgment\]\. Hold back from the funds what you need and send forward the balance for the day of your need\.

Do you expect that Allah may give you the reward of the humble while you yourself remain vain in His view? And do you covet that He may give you the reward of those practicing charity while you enjoy means of comfort, denying them to the weak and the widows? Certainly, a man is awarded according to his deeds\. He shall meet what he has sent before, and that is the end of the matter\.

**Letter 22**

**To Abdullah ibn Abbas\. Abdullah ibn Abbas used to say, “Apart from the Prophet’s statements, I did not derive a greater benefit from any other statement\.”**

Let it be known to you that sometimes a man gets pleased with securing a thing which he was not going to miss at all and gets displeased at missing a thing which he would not in any case get\. Your pleasure should be about what you secure with regard to your next life, and our grief for having lost you should be for what you miss in respect thereof\. Do not be very much pleased with what you secure from this world, nor should you get extremely grieved over what you miss of it\. Your worry should be about what is to come after death\.

**Will 23**

**Made Shortly Before His Death When He Had Been Fatally Wounded by a Blow from the Sword of \(\`Abd Ar\-rahman\) Ibn Muljim \(The Curse of Allah Be Upon Him\)\.**

<a id="page759"></a>I enjoin you, as my dying wish, not to regard anything as a partner with Allah, not to disregard the Sunnah of Muhammad \(h\)\.

Establish these two pillars and light these two lamps\. You will then be free from evil\. Yesterday, I was your companion\. Today, I am \(just\) a lesson for you, while tomorrow I shall be leaving you\. If I survive, I shall be the master of my blood \(to avenge or not to avenge it\), and if I die, then death is a promised event\. If I forgive, it is for me a means of nearness \(to Allah\) and for you a good deed\. Therefore, do forgive\. “What?\! Do not you love that Allah should forgive you?” \(Holy Quran, 24: 22\)\.

By Allah\! This sudden death is not an event that I dislike, nor is it an accident that I hate\. I am just like a night traveller who reaches the spring \(in the morning\), or like or seeker who secures \(his aim\): “And whatever is with Allah is the best for the righteous” \(Holy Quran, 3: 198\)\.

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “A portion of this statement has already appeared in the sermons, but I found it necessary to record it again because of some additional matter\.”

**Will 24**

**Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib’s Will Regarding How His Property Should Be Dealt With\. He Wrote it upon His Return from Siffin\.**

This is what Ali ibn Abu Talib, the slave of Allah, has laid down about his property, seeking Allah’s pleasure, so that He may, by its virtue, grant him entry into Paradise and accord him peace\.

**An excerpt from the same:**

It will be administered by \[my oldest son\] Hassan ibn Ali \(x\)\. He will take from it a suitable portion for his own livelihood while also spending of it on charity\. If something happens to Hassan and Hussain \(x\) survives him, he \(Hussain \[x\]\) will administer it after Hassan and deal with it accordingly\. In the charitable estate of the two sons of Fatima \(x\), they have the same rights as all \(other\) sons of Ali\. I have laid down the \(functions of\) administration of the two sons of Fatima \(x\) in order to seek the pleasure of Allah and nearness to the Messenger of Allah \(k\)

with due regard for his honor and in consideration of his kinship \[to them\]\.

<a id="page760"></a>It is obligatory on him who administers it to retain the estate as it is and to spends the surplus as he has been required and instructed\. He should not sell the seedlings in the plantations of these villages till the land changes its face by turning them into \[fully grown\] plants\. As for those of my slave girls, if any of them has a child or is pregnant, she would be retained for the sake of the \[birth of the\] child and will partake of his share\. If the child dies and she survives, then she is free; bondage is removed from her and emancipation is granted to her\.209

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “In this will, in Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s phrase ‘alla yabi’a min nakhliha wadiyyatan’, the word wadiyyah means ‘seedling of a date\-palm’, and its plural is wadiyy\. And his words ‘hatta tushkila arduha ghirasan’ is one of the most eloquent form of expression, and it means that when a number of date plants grow on the land, then whoever had seen it before the growth will now regard it as a different land\.”

**Instruction 25**

**Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) used to write the following to**

**whoever he appointed for the collection of zakat and charities\. Al\-**

**Sharif says the following:**

209The life of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) was that of a laborer or a

cultivator, and he dug up a number of wells, too\. He worked in agricultural fields belonging to other persons\. He cultivated barren and untilled lands, providing means of irrigating to them, making them cultivable, and he planted orchards\. Since these lands were entirely cultivated by him, they were his property, yet he never paid heed to property and, declaring them a trust, gave up his proprietorship\. But in consideration of his kinship to the Prophet \(k\), he

assigned the management rights of this trust to Imam Hassan and Imam Hussain \(x\), one after the other\. Yet he did not tolerate granting any additional rights for

them but treated them both like other children of his, giving them merely the right to take from their inheritance only what was needed for their livelihood\. The balance he ordered to be spent for the common good of the Muslims and for charitable purposes\. Thus, Ibn Abul\-Hadid writes the following: “Everyone knows that in Medina, Yanbu’ and Suwayqah, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had

dug up several springs and brought under cultivation many barren and uncultivable lands\. Yet, he gave up his rights of their possession, declaring them as trusts for the Muslims\. When he left the world, nothing remained behind him as his property” \(_Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha_, Vol\. 15, p\. 146\)\.

<a id="page761"></a>“We have recorded a few portions of it here to show that he always erected the pillars of right and created examples of justice in all matters, small or big, delicate or serious\.”

Move on with the fear of Allah Who is One and has no partner\. Do not frighten any Muslim\. Do not pass over anyone’s land so as to make him feel unhappy\. Do not take from him more than Allah’s share in his property\. When you go to a tribe, you should get down at its watering place instead of entering their houses\. Then proceed towards them with peace and dignity till you stand among them\. Salute them and do not be negligent in greeting them\. After that, say to them, “O servants of Allah\! The vicegerent of Allah and His caliph has sent me to you to collect from you Allah’s share of your properties\. Is there anything of His share in your properties? If so, give it to His vicegerent\.”

If someone among them says, “No,” then do not repeat the demand\. If someone speaks to you in the affirmative, go with him without frightening him, threatening him, pressuring him or oppressing him\. Take what he gives you, such as gold or silver \(coins\)\. If he has cattle or camels, do not enter upon them save with his permission because their major part is his\. When you get there, do not enter upon them like one who has full control over them or in any violent manner whatsoever\. Do not scare any animal\. Do not tease anyone, and do not let the owner feel grieved over anything\.

Divide the property into two parts and let the owner choose one\. Once he has chosen, do not object to it\. Then divide the remaining into two parts and let him choose one\. Once he has chosen, do not raise any objection\. Continue like this till only that much remains which is enough to satisfy Allah’s dues\. Then take Allah’s due from it\. If he contends your action, allow his views to prevail, then mix the two \(separated\) parts and repeat what you had done before till you take Allah’s due from his property\. Do not take any old, decrepit, broken\-limbed, sick or unsound animal\. Do not entrust the animals except to one whom you trust to take care of Muslims’ property till he hands it over to their chief who will distribute it\. Do not entrust it to anyone except to whoever is a well wisher, God\-fearing, trustworthy and watchful, to one who is not harsh with regard to Muslims’ property\. Nor should you make them run too much, nor should you expose them to exhaustion, nor should you over\-work them\. Then send us all that you have collected\. We shall deal with it as Allah has ordered\.

<a id="page762"></a>When your trustee takes over \(the animal\), tell him that he should not separate the she\-camel from its young and should not milk all its milk because that will affect its young\. Also, he should not exert it in riding\. In this matter, he should deal justly with it and with all its companions\. He should give rest to the \[tired\] camels and drive with ease those whose hoofs have been rubbed off\. When you pass a water spring, keep the camels there to drink and do not take them away from a vegetated land to barren paths\. He should allow them rest now then and give them time near the water and the grass\. In this way, when they reach us by leave of Allah, they will be fat with plenty of marrow and will not be fatigued or distressed\. We will then distribute them according to the \(commands of\) the Books of Allah and the Sunnah of His Prophet \(h\)\. Certainly, this

will be a great source of reward for you and a means to secure guidance, if Allah so wills\.

**Instruction 26**

**Given to One of His Officers Whom He Sent for the Collection of Zakat and Charities\.**

He \(Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \[x\]\) ordered him to fear Allah in his

secret matters and hidden actions, where there is no witness except the One and only Who watches over all\. He also orders him that whatever he does in obedience to Allah openly should not be different from what he does secretly\. Anyone whose hidden attitude is not different from his open one and whose action is not different from his words has discharged his obligation and his adoration is pure\.

He also ordered him that he should not harass the public\. He should not be harsh to them and should not turn away from them because of the superiority of his official status over them because they are all brethren in faith and assist in the recovery of taxes:

Certainly, you have a fixed share and a known right in this levy, and there are others who are poor, weak and starving\. We shall discharge your rights\. So, you should \[first\] discharge their rights\. If you do not do so, you will have the largest number of enemies on the Day of Judgement\. How wretched is the man whose enemies in the view of Allah are theneedy, the destitute, the beggars, the turned away, the indebted and the \(penniless\) travellers?\! Whoever treats the trust lightly, indulges in treachery and does not keep himself and his faith untarnished by it has certainly secured humiliation in this world while his humiliation and

<a id="page763"></a>disgrace in the next world will be much greater\. Surely, the greatest treachery is the treachery against the Muslim community, and the most ugly deceit is deceiving the Muslim leaders, and that is the end of the matter\.

**Instruction 27**

**Given to Muhammad Ibn Abu Bakr \(May Allah Be Pleased with Him\), When Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Appointed Him as Governor of Egypt:**

Deal humbly with the public\. Remain lenient\. Meet them large\-heartedly, accord them equal treatment so that the mighty should not expect injustice from you in their favor and the lowly should not be despondent of your justice\. Allah, the Sublime, will certainly question you, O community of His creatures, about your actions, small or big, open or concealed\. If He punishes you, it is because you have been oppressive, and if He forgives you, then it is because He is the most Generous\.

Be informed, O servants of Allah, that the God\-fearing share the joys of this transient world as well as those of the next, for they share with the people of this world in their worldly matters while their people did not share with them in the matters of the next\. They lived in this world in the best manner of living\. They ate the choicest food and enjoyed herein all that the people with ease of life enjoyed\. They secured from it what the haughty and the vain secured\. Then they departed from it after taking provision enough to take them to the end of their journey, having contracted a profitable transaction\. They tasted the pleasure of renouncing the life in this world, firmly believing that on the Coming Day, they will be neighbors of Allah, where their call will not be repulsed, nor will their share of pleasure be small\.

O servants of Allah\! Fear death and its measures, and prepare all that is needed for it\. It will come as a big event and a great affair, either as something good in which there will never be any evil, or an evil one in which there will never be any good\. Who is nearer to Paradise than one who works towards it, and who is nearer to Hell than one who works for it? You are being chased by death\. If you stop, it will catch you, and if you run away from it, it will grab you\. It is more attached to you than your own shadow\. Death is tied to your forelocks while the world is being wrapped up from behind you\. Therefore, fear the Fire whose hollow is deep, whose flames are severe and whose punishment is novel\. It is a

<a id="page764"></a>place wherein there is no mercy\. No call is heard in it\. No pain is healed in it\. If it is possible for you to have severe fear of Allah and to rest hope in Him, then do both these things because every individual can have hope in His Lord to the extent of his fear of His Lord\. Certainly, the most hopeful person with Allah is whoever fears Him the most\.

O Muhammad son of Abu Bakr\! Be informed that I have given you charge of Egypt which is my biggest force\. You are duty\-bound to oppose your passions and to serve as a shield against your religion even though you may get only an hour in the world\. Do not enrage Allah for pleasing others because \(Allah\) is such that He may take the place of others, yet others cannot take the place of Allah\. Say prayers at their appointed times\. Do not say your prayers earlier for the sake of \(available\) leisure, nor should you delay them on account of any preoccupation\. Remember that every deed of yours is dependent on your prayers\.

**An excerpt of the same:**

The leader of guidance and the leader of destruction cannot be equal, nor can the friend of the Prophet \(h\) and the enemy of the Prophet \(h\)\. The Messenger of Allah \(h\) has told me that: “With regard to my people, I

am afraid neither of a believer nor of an unbeliever\. As for the believer, Allah will afford him protection because of his belief\. As for the unbeliever, Allah will humiliate him because of his lack of belief\. But I fear for anyone of you who is hypocrite in his heart and who has mastered the language\. He speaks what you hold as good but does whatever you dislike\.

**Letter 28**

**In Reply to Mu\`awiyah, One of His Most Elegant Writings**:

Now, your letter has reached me wherein you recall that Allah chose Muhammad \(h\) for His religion and helped him through those

companions who assisted him\. Strange things about you have remained concealed \(by theirony of fate\) from us, since you have started telling us of Allah’s trials for us and His bounties through \[the kinship to\] our Prophet \(h\)\. In this regard, you are like one who carries dates to Hajar, or who challenges his own master to a duel in archery\.

<a id="page765"></a>You think that so\-and\-so are the most distinguished persons in Islam\. You have said such a thing with which, were it true, you have nothing to do, but if it is not so, then the defect in it will not affect you\. And what are you going to do with the question of who is better and who is worse, or who is the ruler and who is the ruled? What do the freed ones and their sons have to do with distinguishing between the first Muhajirun and determining their status or defining their ranks? What a pity\! The sound of an arrow is being produced by what is not a real arrow, and he against whom the judgement is to be passed is seated to judge\! O mankind\! Why do you not see your own lameness and thus remain within the bounds, and why do you not realize the shortness of your measure and stay back where destiny has placed you?\! You have no concern with the defeat of the defeated or with the victory of the victor\.

You are wandering in bewilderment, straying from the right path\. Do you not realize it? I am not giving you any news: I am just recounting Allah’s bounty, namely that a number of people from among the Muhajirun \(immigrants from Mecca\) and the Ansar \(helpers\) fell as martyrs in the way of Allah the Sublime and that each of them is distinguished \(on that account\)\. But when one of us secures martyrdom, he is named the chief of martyrs, and the Messenger of Allah grants him the special honor of saying seventy takbir \(Allahu Akbar\) during his funeral prayer\. Do you not know that a number of people lost their hands in the way of Allah and that everyone is distinguished \(on that account\)? But when the same thing takes place to one of us \[such as Ja’fer al\-Tayyar\], he is given the title “the flier in Paradise” and “the two\-winged one”? Had not Allah forbidden self \-praise, the writer would have mentioned numerous distinctions which the believer knows fully well and which the ears of the listeners do not wish to forget\.

Better leave those whose arrows miss themark\. We \[Ahl al\-Bayt \(x\)\] are the direct recipients of our Lord’s favors while others receive

favors from us after that\. In spite of our established honor and well\-known superiority over people, we did not stay away from mingling with you, intermarrying with you like equals although you are not so\. And how could you be so when \(our status is that\) among us is the Prophet \(h\)

while among you is his opponent, among us is the lion of Allah while among you is the lion of the opposing groups, among us are the two masters of the youths of Paradise while among you are the children of Hell, among us is the choicest of all the women of the worlds while among you is the bearer of firewood, any many more distinctions on our side while shortcomings \[abound\] on yours?\!

<a id="page766"></a>Our Islam is well\-known and our \(greatness in the \) pre\-Islamic period too cannot be denied\. Whatever remains has been mentioned in the words of Allah, the most Glorified One, the Sublime: “\.\.\. blood relatives have the better claim with regard to one another according to the Book of Allah” \(Holy Quran, 33: 6\)\.

He \(Allah\) the Sublime, also says the following: “Verily, of men the nearest to Abraham are surely those who followed him and this Prophet \(Muhammad \[h\]\) and those who believe, and verily, Allah, is the Guardian of the faithful” \(Holy Quran, 3: 68\)\.

Thus, we are superior firstly because of kinship and, secondly, because of obedience \[of the Almighty\]\. At the saqifa \(of Banu Sa’idah\), the Muhajirun contended kinship with the Messenger of Allah against the Ansar, scoring over them\. If that success was based on kinship, then the right will be ours better than yours; otherwise, the Ansar’s contention stands\.

You think that I have been jealous of every caliph and have revolted against them all\. Even if this is so, it is not an offence against you and, therefore, I owe you no explanation\. This is a matter for which no blame comes to you\.

You have said that I was dragged like a camel with a nose string to swear the oath of allegiance \(to Abu Bakr\) \. By the Eternal One \(Allah\), you had intended to revile me, but you have instead praised me, and you intended to humiliate me but have your own selves been humiliated\. What humiliation does it mean for a Muslim to be the victim of oppression so long as he does not entertain any doubt in his religion, nor any misgiving in his firm belief?\! This argument of mine is intended for others, but I have stated it to you only in so far as it is appropriate\.

Then you recalled my status vis\-a\-vis Othman\. In this regard, an answer is due to you because of your own kinship to him\. So \(now tell me\), which of us was more inimical to Othman and who did more to bring about his killing?\! Who offered him his support and made him sit down, stopping him? Whose help was solicited but turned his face away from the solicitor, drawing his\[Othman’s\] death near till his fate overtook him? No, no; by Allah\.

“Indeed, Allah knows those who hinder others from among you and those who say to their brethren: ‘Come here to us’ and they do not go to fight but a little” \(Holy Quran, 33: 18\)\.

<a id="page767"></a>I am not going to offer my excuse for reproaching him \[Othman\] for \(some of\) his innovations, for if my good counsel and guidance to him was \[considered by you as\] a sin, then very often a person who is blamed is no sinner at all, and sometimes the only reward a counselor reaps is suspicion \(of being an evildoer\)\. I desired naught but reform whatever I am able to \(reform\)\. “My guidance is only with Allah; On Him \(alone\) do I rely and to Him \(alone\) do I turn” \(Holy Quran, 11: 88\)\.

You have mentioned that for me and for my followers you have only the sword\.\.\. This makes even a weeping person laugh\. Did you ever see the descendants of \`Abdul\-Muttalib running away from battle, or being frightened by swords?\! “Wait a little till Hamal joins the battle shortly\.”210And my sword appeased me by killing Hudhayfah\. Then whoever you are seeking will seek you, and whoever you think to be far away will approach you\. I am \(shortly\) speeding towards you with a force of MuhajirÅn and Ansar and those who follow them in virtue\. Their number will be great and their dust will spread all around\. They will be wearing their shrouds, and their most coveted desire is to meet Allah\. They will be accompanied by the descendants of those who took part in the battle of Badr\. They will have Hashemite swords whose splitting you have already seen in the case of your brother, maternal uncle, grandfather and kinsmen\. “\.\.\. nor are they far distant from the unjust ones” \(Holy Quran, 11: 83\)\.

This letter of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib is in reply to Mu\`awiyah’s letter which he sent to Kufa through Abu Umamah al\-Bahili\. It also contains replies to some points which Mu\`awiyah had raised in his letter sent through Abu Muslim al\-Khawlani\.

210This line is a poetic reference to one Hamal ibn Badr\. The full couplet runs thus:

_Wait a little bit till Hamal reaches the battlefield;_

_How pretty death is when it comes\!_

The story behind it is that Malik ibn Zuhayr threatened Hamal ibn Badr with battle and in reply the latter recited this couplet then attacked Malik and killed him\. When Malik’s brother saw this, he killed Hamal and his brother Hudhayfah in revenge\. Then he described this incident in the following couplet:

_I appeased my heart by killing Hamal ibn Badr_

<a id="page768"></a>In Ibn Abu Umamah’s letter, Mu\`awiyah had mentioned the deputation of the Prophet \(h\) and his ascension to revelation and wrote in such a manner as though it was a matter not known to or not understood by Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and that he was in need of

being informed of it\. This is just like a stranger who may draw the map of a house for the guidance of those who dwell in it and apprize them of things already known to them\. This is why Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

has compared him to the man who carried dates to Hajar which was itself noted for abundant growth of dates\.

This is a proverb employed when someone begins to tell a person matters which he already knows better\. The basis of this proverb is that a man of Hajar, which is a town near Bahrain \(in the Persian Gulf\), went to Basra to sell goods and make purchases\. Having finished the sale, he looked about the market to make his purchases and found nothing cheaper than dates\. He, therefore, decided to purchase dates\. When he reached Hajar with his load of dates, their plentitude and cheap price there did not leave him any alternative but to store them so as to sell them later when their price would rise\. The price, however, continued to decline day after day till all the dates became rotten\. This left him nothing except their stones\. In short, after making a reference to the Prophet’s ascension to Prophethood, Mu\`awiyah recounted the distinction and merits of the three caliphs according to his view and wrote the following:

“The most distinguished among the companions and the most high ranking in the view of the Muslims was the first caliph who gathered all the Muslims under one voice, removed their disunity and fought those who were forsaking Islam\. After him is the second caliph who won victories, founded cities and humiliated the unbelievers\. Then came the third caliph who was the victim of oppression\. He propagated religion and spread the word of Allah far and wide” \(Siffin, al\-Minqari, pp\. 86\-87; Al\-Iqd al\-Farid, Vol\. 4, pp\. 334\-335; Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 15, p\. 186\)\.

Mu\`awiyah’s purpose behind bringing up this pointless warbling was to injure Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s feelings and to rouse his temper so as to make him produce such words through his tongue or pen which would so disparage the caliphs and so that he would instigate the people of Syria and Iraq against him by exploiting them\. In fact, he had already set it in the minds of these people that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had

instigated the people against Othman, had got Talhah and az\-Zubayr killed, had turned Aisha out of her house and shed the blood of thousands of Muslims\. Being unaware of the real facts, they were convinced of these

<a id="page769"></a>baseless allegations, yet to strengthen the opposition, Mu\`awiyah thought it advisable to make them believe that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) did not

recognize the achievements of the three caliphs and bore enmity and malice towards them to produce Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s writing as testimony and to use it for rousing the people of Iraq because their majority was much impressed with the environment created by the caliphs and with their greatness\. But Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) realized his

intention and gave him such a reply which put a knot in his tongue\. So, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) exposed the man’s lowliness by referring to

his enmity to Islam and to his acceptance of subjugation under force, advising him to stay within his own bounds, warning him against fixing grades of distinction among those Muhajirun who were in any case superior to him in so far as they had been in the vanguard of those who participated in the hijra \(migration from Mecca to Medna\), whereas since then, Mu\`awiyah himself was only one of those whose life had been spared \(on the day when Mecca fell in the hands of the Muslims\), he did not have the most remote respect among the MuhajirÅn\. Consequently, in the matter under discussion, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had put

Mu\`awiyah’s status as that of a false arrow among real arrows\. This is a proverb which is employed when a man boasts over persons among whom he enjoys no regard\. As regarding his statement that so\-and\-so is greater in distinction, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has, by using the

phrase “you think”, shown that it is his personal opinion which does not have the most remote regard to the truth because this word is used when a false or an unreal statement is made\.

Having refuted this claim of being the most distinguished, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) refers to these qualities and distinctions of Banu

Hashim which conspicuously demonstrate the high degree of their achievements\. Thus, the people who took part in jihad with the Prophet \(h\) and secured martyrdom attained high positions, but the distinction that fell to Hamzah by virtue of his high performance was not secured by anyone else\. The Prophet \(h\) gave him the title of “master of the

martyrs” and performed his funeral prayer fourteen times, thus raising the number of takbirs \(Allahu Akbar\) rose to seventy\. Similarly, in various battles, the hands of the fighters were cut off\. For example, in the battle of Badr, the hands of Khubayb ibn Isaf al\-Ansari and Mu’ath ibn Jabal, and in the battle of Uhud, those of \`Amr ibn al\-Jamuh as\-Salami and \`Ubayd \(Atik\) ibn at\-Tayyihan \(brother of Abul\-Haytham at\-Tayyihan\) were cut off\. But when, in the battle of Mu’tah, the hands of Ja\`far ibn Abu Talib

<a id="page770"></a>were cut off, the Prophet \(h\) singled him out by naming him “the flier in Paradise” and the “two\-winged” resident of Paradise\.

Having recounted the particular achievements of Banu Hashim, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) refers to his own attainments with which the

books of chronicles and traditions are replete and which could not be tarnished with doubts and misgivings\. Thus, traditionists like Ahmed ibn Hanbal\(164/780 \- 241/855\), Ahmed ibn Ali an Nisa’i \(215/830 \- 303/915\) and others say that: “The number of traditions which have been related through reliable sources with regard to the distinctions of Ali ibn AbÅ Talib have not been related about any other companion of the Prophet \(h\)” \(Al\-Mustadrak, Vol\. 3, p\. 107; Al\-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 3, p\. 1115; Tabaqat

al\-Hanabilah, Vol\. 1, p\. 319; Al\-Kamil, Vol\. 3, p\. 399; Tahthab al\-Tahthib, Vol\. 7, p\. 339; Fath al\-Bari, Vol\. 7, p\. 57\)\.

An important distinction out of these particular distinctions of Ahl al\-Bayt \(x\) is the one to which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) refers in

these words: “We are the direct recipients of Allah’s favors while others receive favors from us\.” This is the height of distinction that even the highest personality cannot reach its sublimity on its own, and every other distinction looks small before it\. Acknowledging the greatness and supremacy of this sentence, Ibn Abul\-Hadid writes the following: “Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) intends to convey that we \[Ahl al\-Bayt \(x\)\] are not

obligated to any person since Allah has bestowed all blessings on us directly, there being no intermediary between us and Allah, while all other people are under our obligation and protection, being the intermediary between them and Allah, the Glorified One\. This is a high status indeed\. Its apparent meaning is what the words show but its real sense is that Ahl al\-Bayt \(x\) are the obedient servants of Allah and the

people must be their obedient followers” \(Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 15, p\. 194\)\.

Now, since these people are the first recipients of the bounties of Allah and the source of bounties for the rest of the people, no one from among the people can be compared with them, nor can anyone be regarded as their equal on the basis of social contacts with them, much less than those individuals who were in direct contrast to the attainments and to the characteristics of these people and who used to oppose the truth and anything right on every occasion\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) places

both sides of the picture before Mu\`awiyah and says the following: ‘The Prophet \(h\) was one of us, while your father, Abu Sufyan, was among

<a id="page771"></a>the foremost in opposing him\. Hamzah was one of us, and the Prophet \(h\) gave him the title of Lion of Allah, while your maternal grandfather, Utbah ibn Rabi\`ah, was proud of being the lion of swearers \(against the Prophet \[h\]\)’”\.

When, in the battle of Badr, Hamzah and Utbah ibn Rabi\`ah came to face each other, Hamzah said, “I am Hamzah son of Abdul\-Muttalib; I am the lion of Allah and the lion of His Prophet \(h\)”, whereupon \`Utbah

said, “I am the lion of swearers \(against the Prophet \[h\]\)”\. In another

version, the word “asadul\-ahlaf” is recorded\. The meaning is that he was the chief of the allied parties\.

The story of swearing is that when Banu Abd Manaf acquired a distinct status among the Arab tribes, they thought they should take over from Banu Abdid \-Dar the offices relevant to the Ka\`ba and to strip them off these offices\. In this regard, Banu Abd Manaf made alliances with themselves and with these tribes: Banu Asad ibn Abdil \-Uzza, Banu Taym, Banu Zuhrah and Banu al\-Harith\. They concluded an agreement with all of them\. In order to solemnize this agreement, they drenched their hands in teeb \(perfume\) and swore that they would help each other to death\. For this reason, these tribes were called: “tribes of sworn chaste parties”\. On the other side, the tribes of Banu Abdid\-Dar, Banu Makhzum, Banu Sahm and Banu Adiy also swore that they would resist Banu Abd Manaf and their allies\. These tribes are called simply the allies\. \`Utbah has deemed himself the head of the allied parties\. Some commentators have taken the word “sadul\-ahlaf” to imply Abu Sufyan because he made different tribes swear against the Prophet \(h\) in the battle of the Trench \(Khandaq\),

while some commentators take it to mean Asad ibn Abdil\-Uzzah\. But the latter interpretation does not carry any weight because here Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) is addressing Mu\`awiyah and this interpretation does not hit Mu\`awiyah since Banu Abd Manaf were a party to this alliance\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) says, “They have among themselves the masters of

the youths of Paradise, referring to the Prophet’s saying, al\-Hassan and al\-Hussain are the masters of the youths of Paradise, while the youths of the other party are in Hell’\. This reference is to the sons of Uqbah ibn Abu Mu’eet to whom the Prophet \(h\) once said, ‘For you and your sons is

Hell’\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) says that among them is the chief of all the women of the worlds, namely Fatima az\-Zahra \(x\), while in the other party is the bearer of the wood, namely Umm Jamil, sister of Abu Sufyan\. This woman used to throw thorns in the path of the Prophet \(h\)\. She has

<a id="page772"></a>been referred to in the Holy Quran, along with Abu Lahab, in these words:

“In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful

“May both the hands of Abu Lahab perish, and may he perish, too\. His wealth will not avail him aught nor what he earns\. Soon shall he burn in the flaming Fire\. And his wife is the bearer of the firewood\. Upon her neck shall be a halter of twisted rope” \(Holy Quran, 111: 1\-5\)\.

It is narrated from Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), Umar ibn al\-Khattab, Hudhayfah ibn al\-Yaman, Abu Sa’id al\-Khudri, Abu Hurayra and others that the Holy Prophet \(h\) said the following: “Verily, Fatima \(x\) is the Supreme Lady of the women of Paradise, and al\-Hassan and al\-

Hussain are the two Supreme Youths of Paradise\. But their father \(Ali\) is Superior to them” \(Al\-Jamias\-Sahih, al\-Tirmidhi, Vol\. 5, pp\. 656, 661; Al\-Musnad, Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Vol\. 3, pp\. 3, 62, 64, 82; Vol\. 5, pp\. 391, 392; Al\-Sunan, Ibn Majah, Vol\. 1, p\. 56; Al\-Mustadrak, al\-Hakim, Vol\. 3,

1. 167; Majma’az\-Zawa’id, Vol\. 9, pp\. 183, 184, 201; Kanz al\-Ummal, al\-Muttaqi, Vol\. 13, pp\. 127, 128; Al\-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 4, p\. 1895; Usd al\-Ghaba, Vol\. 5, p\. 574; Tarikh Baghdad, Vol\. 1, p\. 140; Vol\. 6, p\. 372; Vol\. 10, p\. 230; Tarikh, Ibn Asakir, Vol\. 7, p\. 365\)\.

It is also narrated from Imran ibn al\-Hussain and Abu Tha’labah al\-Khushni that the Holy Prophet \(h\) said the following to Fatima \(x\):

“O my daughter\! Are you not satisfied that you are verily the Supreme Lady of all women of the worlds?” She said, “O father\! Then what about Maryam \(Mary\) daughter of Imran?” He said, “She was the Supreme Lady of her time while you are the Supreme Lady of all ages\. Truly, by Allah, I married you off to one who is a master in this world and in the hereafter\. No one hates him save a hypocrite” \(Hilyat al\-Awliya’, Vol\. 2, p\. 92; Al\-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 4, p\. 1895; Al\-Isaba, Vol\. 4, p\. 275\)\.

Also, Aisha narrated that the Holy Prophet \(h\) said the following: “O Fatima \(x\)\! Will you not be satisfied to be the Supreme

Lady of the women of the worlds \(or\) the Supreme Lady of all women of this umma \(community\) or of the women believers?” \(al\-Bukhari, Sahih, Vol\. 8, p\. 79; Muslim, Sahih, Vol\. 7, pp\. 142\-144; Ibn Majah, Al\-Sunan, Vol\. 1, p\. 518; Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Al\-Musnad, Vol\. 6, p\. 282; al\-Hakim, Al\-Mustadrak Ala Sahihayn, Vol\. 3, p\. 156\)\.

<a id="page773"></a>The person who goes too far in counselling others will be thought to have his personal ends in so doing, even though his counsel may well be based on sincerity of intention and selflessness\. A poetic couplet runs as follows:

How often a good counsel did I offer you, but sometimes The only reward a counsellor reaps is suspicion\.

**Letter 29**

**To the people of Basra**

Whatever disunity and schism you have is not hidden from you\. I have forgiven your wrongdoers and I have held back my sword from those who ran away\. I received everyone who came to me from among you\. If devastating matters and wrong and silly views are prompting you to break the pledge to me and to oppose me, then listen\! I have readied and saddled my horses, and if you force me to advance towards you, I shall come down in such a manner that before it the Battle of Jamal will appear like the last licking of the tongue\. At the same time, I know the high status of the obedient among you and the right of the sincere ones without confusing the sinless with the offenders of the faithful with the pledge\-breakers\.

**Letter 30**

**To Mu\`awiyah**

Fear Allah regarding what you have amassed and find out your true right turn to understand, for you will not be excused on the grounds of ignorance\. Certainly, for \(following the path of\) obedience there are clear signs, shining ways, straight highways and a fixed aim\. The shrewd proceed towards them while the mean ones turn away from them\. Whoever turns his face from them deviates from righteousness and gropes in bewilderment\. Allah takes away His bounty from him and afflicts him with His chastisement\. Therefore, beware of your own selves\. Allah has already shown you your way and the end where your affairs will terminate\. You are speeding towards the aim of loss and the status of unbelief\. Your ego has pushed you towards evil, thrown you into misguidance and conveyed you to destruction, placing obstacles in your way\.

<a id="page774"></a>

**Commandment 31**

**He Wrote it for His Son al\-Hassan ibn Ali \(x\)1 When He Camped at Al\-hadirin on His Way Back from Siffin:**

From the father who is \(shortly\) to die, who acknowledges the hardships of times, who has turned away from life, who has submitted himself to the \(calamities of\) time, who realizes the evils of the world, who is living in the abodes of the dead and is due to depart from them any day\.\.\. to the son who yearns for what is not to be achieved, who is treading the path of those who have died, who is the victim of ailments, who is entangled in the \(worries of the \) days, who is a target of hardships, a slave of the world, a trader of its deception, a debtor of wishes, a prisoner of morality, an ally of worries, a neighbor of griefs, a victim of distresses who has been overpowered by desires and a successor of the dead\.

Now \(you should know that\) what I have learned from the turning away of this world from me, the onslaught of time over me and the advancing of the next world towards me is enough to prevent me from remembering anyone except my soul and from thinking beyond myself\. But when I confined myself to my own worries, leaving aside the worries of others, my intelligence saved me and protected me from my own desires\. It clarified to me my affairs and led me to seriousness wherein there was no trickery and truth which was not tarnished by falsehood\. Here, I found you a part of myself, rather I found you my whole, so much so that if anything befell you, it was as though it befell me, and if death came to you, it was as though it came to me\. Consequently, your affairs meant to me what my own matters meant to me\. So, I have written this piece of advice \(to you\) as an instrument of seeking help, whether I remain alive or cease to exist\.

<a id="page775"></a>I admonish you to fear Allah, O my child, to abide by His commands, to fill your heart with His remembrance and to cling to hope from Him\. No regard is more reliable than the regard between you and Allah provided you take hold of it\. Enliven your heart with preaching, kill it by renunciation, energize it with firm belief, enlighten it with wisdom, humiliate it by recalling death, make it believe in mortality, make it see the misfortunes of this world, make it fear the authority of the time and the severity of some changes during the nights and the days\. Place before it the events of past peoples, recall to it what befell those who were before you and walk among their cities and ruins, then see what they did and from what they have gone away, where they have gone and stayed\. You will find that they departed from \(their\) friends and remained in loneliness\. Shortly, you, too, will be like one of them\. Therefore, plan for your place of stay and do not sell your next life for this one\.

Give up discussing what you do not know and speaking about what does not concern you\. Keep off the track from which you fear to go astray because refraining \(from moving\) when there is fear of straying is better than embarking on dangers\. Ask others to do good; you will thus be among the doers of goodness\. Discourage others from evil deeds with your own actions as well as speech and keep off, to the best of your ability, from whoever commits it\. Struggle for Allah as is His due, and the reviling of a reviler should not deter you in matters relevant to Allah\. Leap into dangers for the sake of what is right wherever it may be\. Acquire insight into religious law\. Habituate yourself to endure hardships since the best trait of character is endurance in matters of righteousness\. In all your affairs, resign yourself to your Lord because you will thus be resigning yourself to a secure shelter and a strong protector\. You should ask only from your Lord because in His hand is all the giving and depriving\. Seek goodness \(from Allah\) as much as you can\. Understand my advice and do not turn away from it because the best saying is that which benefits\. Be informed that there is no good in that knowledge which is futile, and if knowledge is not implemented, then its acquisition is not justified\.

O my child\! When I noticed that I was of goodly age and noticed that I was increasing in weakness, I hastened with regard to my will to you and wrote down salient points lest death should overtook me before I divulged to you what I have in my heart, or lest my wit should be affected just as my body has been, or the forces of passions or the mischiefs of the world overtake you making you like a stubborn camel\. Certainly, the heart of a young man is like an uncultivated land\. It accepts whatever is strewn on it\. So, I hastened to mold you properly before your heart

<a id="page776"></a>hardened and your mind became occupied, so that you might be ready to accept through your intelligence the results of the experience of others and be saved from going through these experiences yourself\. In this way, you will avoid the hardship of seeking them and the difficulties of experimenting\. Thus, you are getting to know what we had experienced and even those things are becoming clear to you which we might have missed\.

O my child\! Even though I have not reached the age which those before me have, yet I looked into their behavior and thought over events of their lives\. I walked among their ruins till I was like one of them\. In fact, by virtue of their affairs that have become known to me, it is as though I have lived with them from the very first to the very last\. I have, therefore, been able to discern the impure from the clean and benefit from harm\.

I have selected for you the choicest of those matters and collected for you their good points and have kept away from you their useless points\. Since I feel for your affairs as a living father should, I aim at giving you guidance\. I thought it should be at a time when you are advancing in age and new to the state of the world, possessing upright intention and a clean heart and that I should, being with the teaching of the Book of Allah, to Whom belong Might and Majesty, and its interpretation, the laws and commandments of Islam, its lawful matters and unlawful ones and that I should not go beyond these for you\. Then I feared lest you should get confused as other people had been confused on account of their passions and \(different\) views\. Therefore, in spite of disliking the thought of warning you, I thought it better for me to make this issue strong rather than leave you in a status where I do not regard you safe from falling into destruction\. I hoped that Allah will help you in your straightforwardness and guide you in your resoluteness\. Consequently, I wrote this piece of my will for you\.

Be informed, O my child, that what I love the most for you is that you adopt my will to fear Allah, to confine yourself to what Allah has made obligatory on you, to follow the actions of your forefathers and the virtuous people of your household\. These did not fall short in seeing for themselves what you will see for yourself, and they did about their affairs as you will like to think \(about your own affairs\)\. Thereafter, their thinking led them to discharge the obligations which they came to know and to desist from what they were not required to do\. If your heart does not accept this without acquiring knowledge as they acquired it, then your search should first be by way of understanding and learning, not by falling into doubts or getting entangled in quarrels\.

<a id="page777"></a>Before you probe into this, you should begin by seeking your Lord’s help, turning to Him for competence and keeping aloof from everything that throws you into doubt or flings you towards misguidance\. When you have made sure that your heart is clean and humble and your thoughts have come together, and once you have only a reflection about this matter\.\.\., it is then that you will see what I have explained to you\. If you have not been able to achieve that peace of observation and thinking which you will like to have, then be informed that you are only stamping the ground like a blind she\-camel and falling into darkness while a seeker of religion should not grope in the dark, nor should he create confusion\. It is better to avoid this\.

Appreciate my advice, O my child, and be admonished that Whoever is the master of death is also the master of life, that the Creator causes death as well as gives life, that Whoever destroys is also the restorer of life, and that Whoever inflicts disease is also the one Who cures\. This world continues in the way which Allah has made it with regard to its pleasures, trials, rewards on the Day of Judgement and all that He wishes and you do not know\. If anything of this advice is not understood by you then attribute it to your ignorance of it because when you were first born, you were born ignorant\. Thereafter, you acquired knowledge\. There are many masters of whom you are ignorant\. There are many issues regarding which your sight first wonders and your eye wonders then, after this, you shall see them as they are\. Therefore, cling to the One Who created you, Who fed you and put you in order\. Your worship should be for Him, your eagerness should be towards Him and your fear should be of Him\.

Be informed, O my child, that no one received messages from Allah, the Glorified One, as the Prophet \(h\) did\. Therefore, regard him

as your guide and leader towards salvation\. Certainly, I shall spare no effort in giving you advice, and surely even if you try, you cannot acquire such insight for your welfare as I have for you\.

Be informed, O my child, that if there had been a partner with your Lord, his \[alleged partner’s\] messengers, too, should have come to you and you would have seen signs of his authority and power; you should have known his deeds and qualities\. But He is only One god, Allah, and He has described Himself\. No one can dispute with Him regarding His authority\. He is from eternity and will remain for eternity\. He is before all things without any beginning\. He will remain after all things without an end\. He is far too great to have His divinity proved by any encompassing heart or by any vision\. Once you have understood this,

<a id="page778"></a>you should do what is done by him who is like you by way of his low status, his lack of authority, his increasing incapability and his great need for his Lord so as to seek His obedience\. Fear His chastisement and be forewarned of His wrath because He does not command you save to be virtuous; He does not refrain you save from evil\.

O my child\! I have informed you about the world, its condition, its decay and its passing away, and I have informed you of the next world and of what has been provided in it for its people\. I have recounted to you parables about it so that you may draw instruction from them and depend upon them\. The example of those who have understood the world is like those travelers who, being fed \-up with drought\-stricken places, set off for greenery and a fruitful place\. Then they endure difficulties on the way, separation from friends, hardships of the journey and unwholesome food in order to reach their fields of plenty and places of stay\. Consequently, they do not feel any pain in all this and do not regard any expenditure to be a waste\. Nothing is more lovable to them than what takes them near their goal and carries them closer to their place of stay\. \(Contrariwise\), the example of those who are deceived by this world is like the people who were in a green place but became disgruntled with it and went to a drought\-stricken place\. Therefore, for them nothing is more detestable or abominable than to leave the place where they were and go to a place which they will reach unexpectedly and for which they were heading\.

O my child\! Make yourself the measure \(for dealings\) between you and others\. Thus, you should wish for others what you wish for yourself and hate for others what you hate for yourself\. Do not oppress as you do not like to be oppressed\. Do good to others as you like good to be done to you\. Regard as bad for yourself whatever you regard as bad for others\. Accept that from others which you like others to accept from you\. Do not talk about what you do not know even though what you know may be very little\. Do not say to others what you do not like to be said to you\.

Be informed that self\-admiration is contrary to propriety \(of action\) and is a calamity for the mind\. Therefore, increase your striving and do not become a treasurer for \(wealth to be inherited by\) others\. When you have been guided on the right path, humble yourself before Allah as much as you can\.

Be informed that in front of you lies a road of long distance and severe hardship and that you cannot avoid treading it\. Take your requirements of provision keeping the burden light\. Do not load your back beyond your ability lest its weight should cause you mischief\. Whenever

<a id="page779"></a>you come across a needy person who can carry for you your provision to hand it back to you on the Day of Judgement when you will need it, accept it as a good opportunity and get him to carry it\. Put in that provision as much as you are able to, for it is likely that if you need him \(afterwards\), you may not get hold of him\. If a person is willing to borrow from you in the days of your affluence to pay it back to you at the time of your need, then make use of this opportunity\.

Be informed that in front of you lies an impassable valley wherein the light\-burdened man will be in a better condition than the heavy\-burdened one and the slow\-paced will be in a worse condition than the swift\-paced\. Your terminating point at the other end of this passage will necessarily be either Paradise or Hell\. Therefore, reconnoiter for yourself before alighting and prepare the place before getting down because after death there can be no preparation nor any return to this world\.

Be informed that Whoever owns the treasuries of the heavens and earth has permitted you to pray to Him and has promised you acceptance of the prayer\. He has commanded you to beg from Him in order that He may give you and to seek His mercy in order that He may have mercy on you\. He has not placed anything between you and Him that may veil Him from you\.

He has not required you to get a mediator between yourself and Him, and if you err, He has not prevented you from repenting\. He does not hasten His punishment\. He does not reprimand you for repenting, nor does He humiliate you when humiliation is more appropriate for you\. He is not harsh in accepting repentance\. He does not severely question you about your sins\. He does not disappoint you regarding His mercy\. Rather, He regards abstention from sin as a virtue\. He counts your sin as one while counting your good deed as ten\.

He has opened for you the door of repentance\. Therefore, whenever you call upon Him, He hears your call, and whenever you whisper to Him, He knows the whispers\. Place before Him your needs, unveil yourself before Him, complain to Him of your worries, beseech Him to remove your troubles, seek His help in your affairs and ask Him to grant you from the treasuries of His mercy that which no one else has power to give, namely length of life, health of body and an increase in your sustenance\. Then He has placed the keys of His treasures in your hands in the sense that He has shown you the way to ask Him\.

<a id="page780"></a>Wherever you wish, He opens the doors of His favor by virtue of your prayers\. Let the abundant rains of His mercy fall on you\. Delay in acceptance of your pleas should not disappoint you because the granting of a plea is dependent on the extent of \(your\) intention\. Sometimes, acceptance \(of a plea\) is delayed with a view to its being a source of greater reward to the pleading one and a better gift to the anticipating person\. Sometimes, you may ask for a thing but it is not given to you and a better thing is given to you later, or a thing is taken away from you for some greater good because sometimes you may ask for a thing which contains ruin for your religion if it is granted to you\. Therefore, your request should be for things the beauty of which should be lasting and the burden of which should remain away from you\. As for wealth, it will not last for you, nor will you live for its sake\.

O my child\! Be informed that you have been created for the next world, not for this one, for extinction \(in this world\), not for lasting, and for dying, not for living\. You are in a place which does not belong to you, an abode for making preparations and a passage towards the next world\. You are being chased by death from which the runner\-away cannot escape, as it will surely overtake him\. So, be on guard against it least it should overtake you at a time when you are in a sinful state and you are thinking of repenting, but it creates obstruction between you and between repenting\. In such a case, you will ruin yourself\.

O my child\! Remember death quite often and the place where you have to go suddenly and reach after death, so that when it comes, you will be already on your guard against it, having prepared yourself for it, and it does not come to you all of a sudden and surprise you\. Beware lest you should become deceived by the leanings of the people towards worldly attractions and their rushing upon it\. Allah has warned you about it and the world has informed you of its mortal character, unveiling to you its evils\.

Surely, those \(who go\) after it are like barking dogs or devouring carnivore who hate each other\. Those who are stronger among them eat away the weaker ones, and the big among them tramples over the small\. Some are like tied cattle, and some are like untied cattle that have lost their wits and are running in unknown directions\. They are flocks of calamities wandering in rugged valleys\. There is no herdsman to detain them nor anyone to tend to them and take them to graze\. The world has put them on the track of blindness and taken away their vision from the beacons of guidance\. They have, therefore, been perplexed in its

<a id="page781"></a>bewilderment and sunk in its pleasures\. They took it as a god, so it played havoc with them\. They, too, played with it and forgot what is beyond it\.

Darkness disappears gradually\. Now it is as though travellers have got down and those who hasten will soon meet\. Be informed, O my child, that everyone who is riding on the carriage of night and day is being carried by them even though he may be stationary; he is covering the distance even though he is staying and resting\.

Know with certainty that you cannot achieve your desire and exceed your destined life\. You are on the track of those before you\. Therefore, be humble in seeking and moderate in earning because often seeking leads to deprivation\. Every seeker of livelihood does not get it \[on his own\], nor is everyone who is moderate in seeking is deprived\. Keep yourself away from every low thing even though it may take you to your desired aims because you will not get any return for your own respect which you exhaust\. Do not be the slave of others for Allah had made you free\. There is no goodness in anything “good” achieved through evil, and there is no good in comfort that is achieved through a \(disgracing\) effort\.

Beware lest bearers of greed should carry you and make you descend down to the springs of destruction\. If you can, manage that there will be no wealthy person between yourself and Allah\. Do so because in any case you will find what is for you and get what is your share\. A little received directly from Allah the Glorified One is more dignified than that which is more but is received through His creatures, although \(really\) all is from Allah\.

It is easier to rectify what you miss by silence than to secure what you lose by speaking\. Whatever is in a pot can be retained by closing the lid\. I should prefer you retain what is in your hands rather than seeking what is in the hands of others\. The bitterness of disappointment is better than seeking a hand\-out from people\. Manual labor with chastity is better than the riches of a vicious life\. A man is the best guard of his own secrets\. Often, a man strives for what harms him\. Whoever speaks much speaks nonsense\. Whoever ponders perceives\. Associate yourself with the people of virtue, you will become one of them\. Keep aloof from people of vic, you will remain safe from them\. The worst food is that which is unlawful\. Oppressing the weak is the worst type of oppression\.

Where leniency is unsuitable, harshness is lenience\. Often, cure is illness and illness is cure\. Often, the ill \-wisher gives correct advice while the well\-wisher cheats\. Do not depend upon hopes because hopes are the

<a id="page782"></a>mainstay of fools\. It is wise to safeguard one’s experience\. Your best experience is that which teaches you a lesson\. Make use of leisure before it changes into grief\. Every seeker does not achieve \(what he seeks\), and everyone who departs never returns\. To lose provision and to earn evil for the Day of Judgement means ruin\. Every matter has a consequence\. What is destined for you will shortly come to you\. A trader undertakes a risk\. Often a small quantity is more beneficial than a large one\. There is no good in an ignoble helper nor in a suspicious friend\. Be compliant with the world as long as it is in your grip\. Do not put yourself to risk regarding anything in expectation for more\. Beware lest the attitude of enmity should overpower you\.

Bear yourself towards your brother in such a way that if he disregards kinship, you maintain it; when he turns away, be kind to him and draw near to him; when he withholds, spend over him; when he distances himself, approach him; when he is harsh to you, be lenient to him; when he commits a wrong deed, think of an excuse for him as though you were a slave of his\. Take care that this should not be done inappropriately and that you should not behave thus with an undeserving person\. Do not take the enemy of your friend as a friend of yours because you will thus antagonize your friend\. Give true advice to your brother, be it sweet or bitter\. Swallow your anger because I did not find a sweeter thing than its taste in the end, and nothing is more pleasant than it in the end\. Be lenient to him who is harsh to you, for it is likely that he will shortly become lenient to you\. Treat your enemy with favors because this is the sweeter of the two successes \(the success of revenge and the success of doing a favor\)\.

If you intend to cut yourself off from a friend, leave some room for him from your side by which he may resume his friendship if it so occurs to him some day\. If anyone has a good idea about you, prove it to be true\. Do not disregard the interests of your brother depending upon your terms with him, for he is not your brother if you disregard his interests\. Your family should not become the most miserable people on your account\. Do not lean towards him who turns away from you\. Your brother should not be more firm in his disregard for kinship than you in paying regard to it and you should exceed in doing good to him than his doing evil to you\. Do not feel too much the oppression of a person who oppresses you because he is only busy in harming himself and benefitting you\. The reward of him who pleases you is not that you should displease him\.

<a id="page783"></a>Be informed, O my child, that livelihood is of two kinds: a livelihood that you seek and a livelihood that seeks you which is such that if you do not reach it, it will reach you\. How bad it is to bend down at the time of need and to be harsh while being in riches\! You should have from this world only that with which you can adorn your permanent abode\. If you cry over what has gone out of your hands, then also cry for what has not at all come to you\. Infer about what has not yet happened from what has already happened because occurrences are ever similar\. Do not be like those whom preaching does not benefit unless you inflict pain on them because the wise take instruction from teaching while beasts learn only from beating\.

Ward off from yourself the onslaught of worries by firmness of endurance and purity of belief\. Whoever gives up moderation commits excesses\. A companion is like a relationship\. A friend is one whose absence also proves his friendship\. Passion is a partner of distress\. Often, the near ones are more remote than the distant ones, and often the distant ones are nearer than the near ones\. A stranger is one who has no friends\. Whoever transgresses right narrows his own passage\. Whoever stays in his status remains constant upon it\. The most trustworthy intermediary is that which you adopt between yourself and Allah the Glorified One\. Whoever does not care for your interests is your enemy\. When greed leads to ruin deprivation is an achievement\. Not every defect can be reviewed and not every opportunity recurs\.

Often, a person with eyes misses the track while a blind person finds the correct path\. Delay an evil deed because you will be able to hasten it whenever you wish\. The disregard of kinship of the ignorant is equal to regarding the kinship of the wise\. Whoever takes the world to be safe, it will betray him\. Whoever regards the world as great, it will humiliate him\. Not everyone who shoots hits\. When authority changes, the time changes, too\. Consult the friend before taking a course, the neighbor before buying the house\. Beware lest you should mention in your speech what may cause laughter even though you may be relating it from others\.

Do not consult women because their view is weak and their determination is unstable\. Cover their eyes by keeping them under the veil because strictness of veiling keeps them for long\. Their coming out is not worse than your allowing an untrustworthy man to visit them\. If you can manage that they should not know anyone other than you, do so\. Do not allow a woman matters other than those about herself because a woman is a flower not an administrator\. Do not pay her regard beyond herself\. Do

<a id="page784"></a>not encourage her to intercede for others\. Do not show suspicion out of place because this leads a woman on the right course to evil and a chaste woman to deflection\.

For everyone among your servants fix a task for which you may hold him responsible\. In this way, they will not fling the task one over the other\. Respect your kinsmen because they are your wings with which you fly, the origin towards which you return and the hands with which you attack\. Place your religion and your world at Allah’s disposal and beg Him to ordain the best for you with regard to thenear and the far, this world and the next, and that is the end of the matter\.

**Letter 32**

**To Mu\`awiyah**

You have ruined a large group of people whom you have deceived by your misguidance and have flung them into the currents of your sea where darkness covers them and misgivings toss them about\. As a result, they have strayed from the right path and turned on their backs\. They turned their backs and pushed forward except those wise ones who came back, leaving you behind, having come to understand you very well\. They ran towards Allah away from assisting you when you put them to troubles and caused them to deviate from themiddle path\. Therefore, O Mu\`awiyah, fear Allah about yourself and take your rein away from Satan since this world is shortly to be cut off from you and the next world is near you, and that is the end of the matter\.

**Letter 33**

**To Othman ibn al\-Abbas, his Governor over Mecca**

My informer in the West211 has written to me telling me that some people from Syria have been sent for hajj and who are blind at heart, deaf

211Mu\`awiyah sent some men disguised as pilgrims to Mecca in order to stir the public and steer them away from their peaceful atmosphere\. Taking common men into their confidence, they made a hypocritical show of piety, presenting themselves as God\-fearing\. They persuaded them that Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) instigated the people against Othman\. In the end, they succeeded in

getting Othman killed\. In this way, they were to hold Ali \(x\) responsible for the killing of Othman and to turn the people against him\. They also hoped to incline

<a id="page785"></a>in the ears and devoid of vision\. They confound the truth with vanity, obey men while disobeying Allah, lay a claim on the milk of the world in the name of religion and trade in the pleasures of this world by forsaking the rewards of the virtuous and the God\- fearing\. No one achieves good except whoever labors for it, and no one is awarded the recompense of evil except whoever commits it\. Therefore, carry out your duties like an intelligent, experienced, well\-wishing and wise man who follows his superior and is obedient to his Imam\. You should avoid what you may have later to explain\. Do not rise up in riches nor lose courage when in distress, and that is the end of the matter\.

**Letter 34**

**To Muhammad Ibn Abu Bakr on Coming to Know That He Had Assumed the Position of \(Malik\) Al\- Ashtar as Governor of Egypt after the Latter Had Died on His Way to Egypt**

I have come to know of your anger at the status quo of al \-Ashtar, but I did not do so because of any shortcoming on your part or to get you to increase your responsibilities\. But when I take away what was under your authority, I will place you in a status which will then be less exhausting and more attractive to you\.

The man whom I have made Governor of Egypt was my well\-wisher and very harsh and vengeful towards our enemies\. May Allah have mercy on him since he has finished his days and met his death\. I am quite pleased with him\. May Allah, too, accord him His pleasure and multiply his rewards\. Now get ready for your enemy and act according to your intelligence\. Prepare to fighting one who fights you and call to the path of Allah\. Seek Allah’s help earnestly\. If Allah wills, He will assist you in what worries you and help you with what befalls upon you\.

**Letter 35**

**To Abdullah Ibn Abbas after Muhammad Ibn Abu Bakr Had Been Killed**

the people towards Mu\`awiyah by mentioning the greatness of his character, the sublimity of his manners and the tales of his generosity\. But when the men whom Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had put on the job informed him of all of

this, he wrote this letter to Qutham ibn al\-Abbas so that he might keep an eye on their movements and put an end to their mischief\.

<a id="page786"></a>Now then, Egypt has been conquered and Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr, may Allah have mercy on him, has been martyred\. We seek his reward from Allah\. He was a son who was a well\-wisher, a hard worker, a sharp sword and a bastion of defense\. I had called upon the people to join him and ordered them to reach him to help him prior to this incident\. I repeatedly called upon them secretly and openly\. Some of them came half\-heartedly, some put up false excuses, and some sat away leaving me behind\. I ask Allah, the Sublime One, to grant me an early relief from them, for by Allah, had I not been yearning to meet the enemy for the sake of martyrdom and not prepared myself for death, I would not have liked to be with these people for a single day, nor ever to face the enemy with them\.

**Letter 36**

**To His Brother, Aqil ibn Abu Talib1, in Reply to His Letter Containing a Reference to the Army Which Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Had Sent to Meet an Enemy**

I sent him a large army of Muslims\. When he came to know of it, he fled away and retreated in repent\. They met him on the way when the sun was about to set\. They grappled for a while like nothing\. It was about an hour then he rescued himself, half\-dead, as he had almost been taken by the neck and only the last breath had remained in him\. In this way, he escaped in panic\.

Leave the tribesmen of Quraish rushing in misguidance, their galloping in disunity and their leaping over destruction\. They have joined

212Following the arbitration, Mu\`awiyah started a campaign of killing and devastation\. He sent a force of four thousand under ad\-Dahhak ibn Qays al\-Fihri to attack Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s cities\. When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) came to know of his activities, he stirred the people of Kufa to put up

defenses, but they began to offer lame excuses\. At last, Hijr ibn Adiy al\-Kindi rose with a force of four thousand men and, chasing the enemy, overtook him at Tadmur\. The two parties had only a few skirmishes when darkness fell in and ad\-Dahhak fled away under its cover\. This was the time when Aqil ibn Abu Talib had come to Mecca for _umra_\. When he came to know that after attacking Hira, ad\-Dahhak had escaped alive, that the people of Kufa were afraid of war and all their activities had come to a halt, he sent a letter to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) through Abd ar\-Rahman ibn Ubayd al\-Azdi offering his help\. In reply,

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) wrote this letter wherein he complained of the behavior of the people of Kufa, making a reference to the flight of ad\-Dahhak\.

<a id="page787"></a>together to fight me as they had joined to fight the Messenger of Allah \(k\) before me\. I wish the tribesmen of Quraish will get the reward of thus treating me\. They disregarded my kinship \[to the Prophet \(k\)\] and deprived me of the power due to me from the son of my mother \(i\.e\. the Holy Prophet \[h\]\)\.

As regarding your inquiry about my opinion to fight till I die, I am in favor of fighting those who regard fighting as lawful\. The crowd of men around me does not give me strength, nor does their dispersal from me cause any loneliness\. Surely, do not consider the son of your father as weak or afraid, even though all people have forsaken him\. Bow down submissively before injustice or hand over his reins into the hand of the puller, or allow his back to be used by the rider to sit on\. But he is as the man of Banu Salim has:

If you inquire how I am, then listen: I am enduring and strong Against the vicissitudes of time\. I do not allow myself to be

forlorn

Lest the foe feels joyed and the friend feels the sorrow\.

**Letter 37**

**To Mu\`awiyah**

Glory to Allah\! How staunchly you cling to innovated passions and painful bewilderment along with ignoring the facts and rejecting strong reasons which are liked by Allah and serve as pleas for the people\! As regarding your prolonging the question of \`Othman’s murder213, the

213There is no question that Mu\`awiyah claimed to help Othman after the latter had been killed\. When Othman was besieged and desperately needed help, he wrote Mu\`awiyah pleading for his help, but his written plea fell upon the deaf ears of Mu\`awiyah who never budged an inch\. However, just to make a public show that he sent a contingent to Medina under the command of Yazid ibn Asad al\-Qasri, ordering it to remain waiting nearby in the valley of Dhu Khushub near Medina\. Eventually, Othman was murdered and the commander went back with his contingent, having accomplished nothing\. Undoubtedly, Mu\`awiyah wished Othman to be killed so that he could create confusion in the name of seeking revenge for the shedding of his blood\. Through such disturbances, Mu\`awiyah could clear the way for securing allegiance to himself \(as caliph\)\. This is why he neither helped Othman when he was besieged nor thought it necessary to trace the murderers of Othman after actually having secured power for himself\.

<a id="page788"></a>situation is that you helped Othman when you were really promoting your own cause, and you forsook him when he was in need of help, and that is the end of the matter\.

**Letter 38**

**To the People of Egypt When He Appointed \(Malik Ibn\) al\-Ashtar as Their Governor**

From the slave of Allah, Ali Ibn Abu Talib, to the people who became wrathful for the sake of Allah when He was disobeyed on His earth and His rights were ignored and oppression had spread its coverings over the virtuous as well as the vicious, on the native as well as the foreigner\. Consequently, no good was acted upon nor any evil was avoided\.

I have sent you a man from among the servants of Allah Who allows himself no sleep in the days of danger, nor does he shrink from the enemy at critical moments\. He is more severe with the wicked than a blazing fire\. He is Malik ibn al\-Harith, our brother from \(the tribe of\) Madhhaj\. Therefore, listen to him and obey his orders that agree with what is right because he is a sword among the swords of Allah the edge of which is not dull and which does not miss its victim\. If he orders you to advance, do advance, and if he orders you to stay, do stay because he surely neither advances nor attacks nor puts anyone backward or forward save with my command\. I have preferred him for you rather than for myself because of his being your well\-wisher and \(because of\) the severity of his harshness with your enemies\.

**Letter 39**

**To Amr ibn al\-As**

You have surely made your religion subservient to the worldly pursuits of a man whose misguidance is not a concealed matter and whose veil has been torn away\. He mars an honorable man with his company and makes fools of those around him\. You are following in his footsteps and seeking his favors like the dog that follows the lion looking at its paws and waiting for whatever remains of his prey that will fall down to it\. In this way, you have ruined your world as well as the next\. Had you stuck to the right, you would have gotten what you were seeking\. If Allah grants me power over you and over the son of Abu Sufyan \(Mu\`awiyah\), I

<a id="page789"></a>shall award you both the recompense of what you have done, but if you escape and survive, then there is only evil for you both, and that is the end of the matter\.

**Letter 40**

**To One of His Officers**

I have come to know such a thing about you which, if you have, you have displeased your Lord, disobeyed your Imam and betrayed your trust\.

I have come to know that you have razed the ground and taken away whatever was under your feet, devouring whatever fell in your hands\. Send me your account and be admonished that accounting to Allah will be much more severe than that to the people, and that is the end of the matter\.

**Letter 41**

**To One of His Officers**

I had made you a partner in my trust and my chief man\. For me, no other person from my kinsmen was more trustworthy than you in the matter of sympathizing with me, assisting and respecting my trust\. But when you saw that time had attacked your cousin, the enemy had waged war, the trust of the people was being humiliated and the community was trackless and disunited, you turned your back against your cousin and forsook him when others forsook him\. You abandoned him when others abandoned him and betrayed him when others betrayed him\. Thus, you showed no sympathy to your cousin, nor did you discharge the trust\.

It seems as if you do not want to please Allah through your jihad, as if you do not stand upon a clear sign from your Lord, and as if you have been playing tricks with this umma \(Muslim community\) in order to earn \(the pleasure of\) this world, watching for the moment of their neglectfulness in order to usurp their wealth\. As soon as it was possible for you to misappropriate the umma’s trust, you tended to turn around and attack \(them\), making a swift leap to snatch away whatever you could from their property\. Such a property was intended for their widows and orphans\. You did so like a wolf snatching a wounded and helpless goat\. Then you happily loaded it off to Hijaz without feeling guilty for having thus acquired it\. Allah’s woe be upon your ill\-wishers\! It was as though

<a id="page790"></a>you were sending to your family what you had inherited from your parents\.

Glory to Allah\! Do you either not believe in the Day of Judgement, or you do not fear the exaction of account? O you who were counted by us among the men possessing sound minds, how can you enjoy food and drink when you know that you are eating and drinking what is unlawful? You are purchasing bondmaids and wedding women with the money of the orphans, the poor, the believers and the participants in jihad to whom Allah had dedicated this money and through whom He had strengthened these cities\. Fear Allah and return to these people their properties\. If you do not do so and Allah grants me power over you, I shall excuse myself before Allah about you and strike you with my sword with which I did not strike anyone but that he went to Hell\.

By Allah, even if Hassan and Hussain \(x\) had done what you did,

there would have been no leniency for them, and they could not have won their way with me till I had recovered from them the right and destroyed the wrong produced by their unjust actions\. I swear by Allah, the Master of all beings, that I will not be pleased to regard their money which you have appropriated as lawful for me and to leave it to my successors by way of inheritance\. Mind yourself and consider for a while as though you had reached the end of life and had been buried under the earth\. Your actions will then be presented before you in the place where the oppressor cries “Alas\!” while whoever wasted his life yearns for return \(to the world\) “\.\.\. but there was no time to escape” \(Holy Quran, 38: 3\)\.

**Letter 42**

**To Umar Ibn Abu Salamah Al\-Makhzumi \(Foster\-Son of the Holy Prophet \(h\) from Umm Al\-Mu’minin, Umm Salamah\) Who**

**Was Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib’s Governor of Bahrain, but Whom He Removed and Replaced with An\-nu’man Ibn Ajlan az\-Zuraqi**

1. have posted an\-Nu’man ibn \`Ajlan az\-Zuraqi in Bahrain and have released you from that position without anything bad from you nor reproach on you because you managed to govern well and carried out your obligations\. Therefore, proceed to me when you are neither suspected nor rebuked, neither blamed nor guilty\. I have just intended to proceed towards the rebel of Syria \[Mu\`awiyah\]\. I wish that you should be with me because you are among those on whom I can rely in fighting the enemy and in erecting the pillars of religion, if Allah so wills\.

<a id="page791"></a>**Letter 43**

**To Masqalah ibn Hubayrah ash\-Shaybani, Governor of Ardashir Khurrah \(Persia\)**

I have come to know about you a matter which, if you have done, you will have displeased your Lord and disobeyed your Imam\. You are distributing among the Arabs \(bedouins\) of your kin who tend to you the property of the Muslims which they collected by dint of their spears and horses and on which their blood was shed\. By Allah Who germinated the seed and created living beings, if this is true, you will be humbled in my view and you will become light in weight\. Therefore, do not treat lightly the obligations of your Lord and do not reform your world by ruining your religion, since then you will be among the losers through your actions\.

Be informed that the right of those Muslims who are around you and those who are around me in this property is equal\. For that reason, they come to me to take from it\.

**Letter 44**

**To Ziyad Ibn Abih When Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Came**

**to Know That Mu\`awiyah Had Written to Ziyad to Deceive Him and to Attach Him to Himself in Kinship**

I have learned that Mu\`awiyah has written to you to deceive your wit and blunt your sharpness\. You should be on guard against him because he is the Satan who approaches a believer from the front and from the back, from the right and from the left, to catch him suddenly in the hour of his carelessness and to overcome his intelligence\.

During the days of \`Umar ibn al\-Khattab, Abu Sufyan happened to utter a thoughtless point which was an evil insinuation of Satan from which neither kinship is established nor entitlement to succession occurs\. Whoever relies on it is like the uninvited guest to a drinking party or like the dangling cup \(tied to a saddle\)\.

Sayyid ar\- Radi says the following: “When Ziyad read the letter, he said, ‘By Allah he has testified to it’\. This point remained in his mind till Mu\`awiyah claimed him \(to be his brother from his father’s side\)\.”

<a id="page792"></a>Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s word “al\-waghil” means the man who joins the drinking group so as to drink with them, but he is not one of them\. He is, therefore, constantly turned out and pushed away\. As for the words “an\- nawtul\-mudhabdhab”, it is a wooden cup or a bowl, or the like, attached to the saddle of the rider so that it dangles when the rider drives the beast or it hastens its pace\.

Umar ibn al\-Khattab sent Ziyad to Yemen for some encounter\. When he returned, having finished his mission, he addressed a gathering which included Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), Umar, Amr ibn al\-As and

Abu Sufyan\. Impressed with the speech, Amr ibn al \-As said the following: “What a good man\! Had he been from the tribesmen of Quraish, he would have led all of Arabia with his stick,” whereupon Abu Sufyan said, “He is from the tribesmen of Quraish since I know who his father is\.” Amr ibn al\-As inquired, “Who was his father?” Abu Sufyan said, “It is I\.” History also conclusively holds that Ziyad’s mother, Sumayya, who was a slave\-maid of al\-Harith ibn Kaldah and was married to a slave named Ubayd, used to lead an immoral life in a quarter of at\-Ta’if known as Haratul\-Baghaya \(quarter of the prostitutes\) and immoral men used to visit her\. Once Abu Sufyan also slept with her through the mediation of Abu Maryam as\-Saluli\. As a result, Ziyad was born\. When Amr ibn al\-As heard this from Abu Sufyan, he asked why he had not declared it publicly\. Abu Sufyan pointed to \`Umar \[ibn al\-Khattab\] and said that he was afraid of him; otherwise, he would have declared him as his own son\. Although he would not have dared to do this, when Mu\`awiyah acquired power, he started correspondence with him because Mu\`awiyah was in need of such persons who were intelligent and cunning and expert in scheming\. In any case, when Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

got information about this correspondence, he wrote this letter to Ziyad wherein he warned him against Mu\`awiyah so that he should not fall in the trap\. But he did fall in his trap anyway and joined Mu\`awiyah; the latter declared him as his brother by attributing him to his kinsfolk although the Prophet \(h\) had declared, “The child goes to the lawful husband while the adulterer gets stoned\.”

**Letter 45**

**To Othman Ibn Hunayf al\-Ansari Who Was Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib’s Governor of Basra When He Came to Know That the People of Basra Had Invited Othman to a Banquet which He Attended**

<a id="page793"></a>O son of Hunayf\! I have come to know that a young man of Basra invited you to a feast and you leapt towards it\. Foods of different colors were being chosen for you and big bowls were being given to you\. I never thought that you would accept the feast of a people who turn the beggars out while inviting the rich\. Look at the morsels which you take\. Leave out that about which you are in doubt and take that about which you are sure that it has been secured lawfully\.

Remember that every follower has a leader whom he follows, and from the glory of whose knowledge he derives light\. Realize that your Imam is satisfied with two shabby pieces of cloth out of the \(comforts of the\) world and two loaves for his meal\. Certainly, you cannot do so, but at least support me in piety, exertion, chastity and uprightness because, by Allah, I have not treasured any gold out of your world nor amassed plentiful wealth nor collected any clothes other than these two shabby sheets\.

Of course, all that we had in our possession under this sky was Fadak, but a group of people felt greedy for it, and the other party withheld themselves from it\. Allah is, after all, the best arbiter\. What shall I do? Fadak or no Fadak, tomorrow this body is to go into the grave in the darkness of which it will be destroyed and \(even\) news of it will disappear\. It is a pit that, even if its width is widened or the hands of the digger make it broad and open, the stones and clods of clay will narrow it and the falling earth will close its opening\. I try to keep myself engaged in piety so that on the Day of Great Fear it will be peaceful and steady in slippery places\.

Had I wished, I could have taken the way leading to \(worldly pleasures like\) pure honey, fine wheat and silk clothes, but it cannot be that my passions lead me and greed takes me to choosing good meals while in the Hijaz or in Yamama there may be people who have no hope of getting bread or who do not have a full meal\. Shall I lie down with a satiated belly while around me there may be hungry bellies and thirsty livers? Or shall I be as the poet has said:

It is enough for you to have a disease that you lie with your belly full While around you people may be badly yearning for dried leather\.\.\.?

Shall I be content with being called Amr al \-Mu’minin \(Commander of the Faithful\), although I do not share with the people the hardships of the world? Or shall I be an example for them in the distresses of life? I have not been created to keep myself busy eating good foods

<a id="page794"></a>like a tied animal whose only worry is his fodder or like a loose animal whose activity is to swallow\. It fills its belly with its feed and forgets the purpose behind it\. Shall I be left uncontrolled to pasture freely, or draw the rope of misguidance or roam aimlessly in the paths of bewilderment?

I see as if one of you will say that if this is what the son of Abu Talib eats, then weakness must have made him unfit to fight his foes and encounter the brave ones\. Remember that the tree of the forest is the best timber, while green twigs have soft bark and the wild bushes are very strong for burning and slow in dying\. My relationship with the Messenger of Allah is that of one branch with another, or like the wrist with the forearm\. By Allah, if the Arabs join together to fight me, I will not run away from them, and if I get the opportunity, I will hasten to catch them by their necks\. I shall surely strive to relieve the earth of this man of perverse mind and uncouth body till the bits of earth are removed from the grain\.

**An excerpt from the same which is the end of the letter:**

Get away from me, O world\! Your rein is on your own shoulders as I have released myself from your clutches, removed myself from your snares and avoided walking into your slippery places\. Where are those whom you have deceived by your jokes? Where are those communities whom you have enticed with your embellishments? They are all confined to graves and hidden in burial places\. By Allah, if you had been a visible personality and a body capable of feeling, I will have awarded you the penalties fixed by Allah because of the people whom you received through desires, the communities whom you threw into destruction and the rulers whom you consigned to ruin and drove to places of distress after which there is neither going nor returning\. Indeed, whoever stepped on your slippery place slipped, whoever rode your waves was drowned, and whoever evaded your snares received inward support\. Whoever keeps himself safe from you does not worry even though his affairs may be straitened and the world to him is like a day which is near to expire\.

Get away from me for, by Allah, I do not bow before you so that you may humiliate me, nor do I let loose the reins for you so that you may drive me away\! I swear by Allah an oath wherein I, except if Allah wills otherwise, shall so train myself that it will feel joyed if it gets one loaf to eat and be content with only salt to season it\. I shall let my eyes empty themselves of tears like the stream whose water has flown away\. Should Ali eat whatever he has and fall asleep like the cattle who fill their stomachs from the pasture land then lie down, or as the grazing goats, eat

<a id="page795"></a>the green grass then go into their pen\! His eyes may die if he, after long years, follows the ways of loose cattle and pasturing animals\.

Blessed is whoever carries out his obligations towards Allah and endures his hardships, allows himself no sleep in the night but when sleep overpowers him, he lies down on the ground using his hand as a pillow, along with those who keep their eyes wakeful in fear of the Day of Judgement, whose bodies are ever away from beds, whose lips are humming in remembrance of Allah and whose sins have been erased through their prolonged beseeching for forgiveness\. They are the party of Allah; Be it known, “\.\.\. verily the part of Allah alone shall be the successful one” \(Holy Quran, 58: 22\)\. Therefore, O Ibn Hunayf, fear Allah and be content with your own loaves so that you may escape Hell\.

Fadak was a green fertile village near Medina in the Hijaz region, and it also had a fortress called ash\-Shumrukh \(Mu’jam al\-Buldan, Vol\. 4, p\. 238; Mu’jam Masta’jam, al\-Bakri, Vol\. 3, p\. 1015; Al\-Rawd al\-Mi’tar, al\-Himyari, p\. 437; Wafa’ al\-Wafa’, Vol\. 4, p\. 1280\)\. Fadak belonged to the Jews\. In the year 7 A\.H\., its ownership went from the Jews to the Prophet \(h\) under the terms of a peace settlement\. The reason for this

settlement was that after the fall of Khaybar, the Jews realized the real power of the Muslims, their martial aspirations were lowered\. Noting that the Prophet \(h\) had spared the lives of some Jews who sought his

protection, the Jews also sent a message of peace to the Prophet \(h\) and

expressed their desire that Fadak should be taken from them so that their area should not be turned into a battlefield\. Consequently, the Prophet \(h\) accepted their request and granted them amnesty\. This land became

his personal property wherein no one else had any right or claim, nor could there be any interest because the Muslims had a share only in those properties which they acquired as booty after jihad, whereas property acquired without jihad is called fay’ and only the Prophet \(h\) was

entitled to it\. No other person has a share in it\. Thus, Allah says the following: “And whatever Allah bestows on His Messenger from them, you did not stir any horse or a camel towards it, but Allah grants authority to whomsoever of His Messengers He pleases; and Allah over all things is all\-Powerful” \(Holy Quran, 59: 6\)\.

No one has ever disputed the fact that Fadak was secured without battle\. It was, therefore, the Prophet’s personal property to which no one else was entitled\. The Historians write:\.

<a id="page796"></a>“Fadak was personal to the Prophet \(h\) as the Muslims did not

use their horses or camels to acquire it” \(Tarikh, al\-Tabari, Vol\. 1, pp\. 1582\-583, 1589; Al\-Kamil, Ibn al\-Athir, Vol\. 2, pp\. 224\-225; As\-Sira, Ibn Hisham, Vol\. 3, p\. 368; Tarikh, Ibn Khaldun, Vol\. 2, part 2, p\. 40; Tarikh al\-Khamis, ad\-Diyar\-Bakri, Vol\. 2, p\. 58; Al\-Sira al\-Halabiyya, Vol\. 3, p\. 50\)\.

The historian and geographical scholar, Ahmed ibn Yahya al\-Baladhiri \(d\. 279/892\), writes the following: “Fadak was the personal property of the Prophet \(h\) as the Muslims had not used their horses nor camels for its acquisition” \(Fath al\-Buldan, Vol\. 1, p\. 33\)\.

Umar ibn al\-Khattab had himself regarded Fadak as the unshared property of the Holy Prophet \(h\) when he declared the following: “The

property of Banu an \-Nadir was among that which Allah bestowed on His Messenger\. Against them \[its original Jewish owners\], neither horses nor camels were stirred\. It belonged to the Messenger of Allah specifically” \(Sahih, al\-Bukhari, Vol\. 4, p\. 46; Vol\. 7, p\. 82; Vol\. 9, pp\. 121\-122 Sahih, Muslim, Vol\. 5, p\. 151; Al\- Sunan, Abu Dawud, Vol\. 3, pp\. 139\-141; Al\-Sunan, al\-Nisa’i, Vol\. 7, p\. 132; Al\-Musnad, Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Vol\. 1,

1. 25, 48, 60, 208; Al\-Sunan al\-Kubra, al\-Bayhayqi, Vol\. 6, pp\. 296\-

299\)\.

It is also proven, in the accepted way, that the Prophet \(h\) had in his lifetime given this land \(Fadak\) to Fatima \(x\) as a gift\. It is narrated

through al \-Bazzar, Abu Ya\`li, Ibn Abu Hatim, Ibn Mardawayh and others from Abu Sa’id al\-Khudri and through Ibn Mardawayh from Abdullah ibn Abbas that when the verse: “And give to the near of kin his due\.\.\.” \(Holy Quran, 17: 26\) was revealed, the Holy Prophet \(h\) called Fatima \(x\) and

gave her Fadak as a gift” \(Al\-Durr al\-Manthur, al\-Sayyuti, vol, 4, p\. 177; Majma’ al\-Zawa’id, al\-Haythami, vol, 7, p\. 46; Kanz al\-Ummal, al\-Muttaqi al\-Hindi, Vol\. 3, p\. 439; Ruh al\-Ma’ani, al\-Alusi, Vol\. 15, p\. 62\)\.

When Abu Bakr assumed power then, in view of reaping some benefits for his government, he turned Fatima \(x\) out of Fadak and took it from her possession\. Thus, the historians write: “Certainly, Abu Bakr snatched Fadak from Fatima \(x\) \(Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Ibn Abul\-Hadid,

Vol\. 16, p\. 219; Wafa’ul\-Wafa’, as\-Samhudi, Vol\. 3, p\. 1000; Al\-Sawa’iq al\-Muhriqa, Ibn Hajar, p\. 32\)\.

<a id="page797"></a>Fatima \(x\) raised her objection against such an injustice\. Protesting to Abu Bakr, she said, “You have taken over the possession of Fadak although the Prophet \(h\) had given it to me as a gift during his lifetime\.” To this, Abu Bakr asked her to produce a witness for the gift\. Consequently, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and Umm Ayman testified in her favor\. Umm Ayman was the freed bondmaid and the dry nurse of the Holy Prophet \(h\)\. She was the mother of Usamah ibn Zayd ibn al\-Harithah\. The Holy Prophet \(h\) used to say, “Umm Ayman is my mother

after my own mother” \[Al\- Mustadrak, Vol\. 4, p\. 63; al\- Tabari, Vol\. 3, p\. 3460; Al\-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 4, p\. 1793; Usd al\-Ghaba, Vol\. 5, p\. 567\. The Holy Prophet \(h\) testified that she is among the people of Paradise \(Ibn Sa\`d,

Vol\. 8, p\. 192; Al\-Isaba, Vol\. 4, p\. 432\)\. But this testimony was held inadmissible by Abu Bakr, and Fatima’s claim was rejected as being based on a false statement\. About this, al\-Baladhiri writes the following: “Fatima \(x\) said to Abu Bakr, ‘The Messenger of Allah had appropriated Fadak to me\. Therefore, give it to me\.’ He asked her for a witness other than Umm Ayman, saying, ‘O daughter of the Prophet \(h\)\! You know

that testimony is not admissible except by two men or one man and two women\.”

After these facts, there remains no possibility of denying that Fadak was the personal property of the Prophet \(h\) and that he had

completed its gifting to her by handing over possession in his own lifetime\. But Abu Bakr took over its possession and dislodged her from it\. In this regard, he rejected the testimony of Ali and Umm Ayman on the ground that the requirement of testimony was not completed when only one man and one woman testify\. Besides them, Imam Hassan and Imam Hussain \(x\), too, testified in support for Fatima \(x\), but their testimony,

too, was rejected on the ground that the testimony of the offspring and “minors” was not acceptable in favor of their parents\. Then Rabah, slave of the Holy Prophet \(h\), was also produced as a witness in support for

the claim of Fatima \(x\), brining the number of witnesses to five\. But the

testimony of the virtuous Rabah, too, was rejected \(Fath al\-Buldan, al\-Baladhiri, Vol\. 1, p\. 35; Tarikh, al\- Ya\`qubi, Vol\. 3, p\. 195; Muruj al\-Dhahab, al\- Mas\`udi, Vol\. 3, p\. 237; Al \-Awa’il, Abu Hilal al\-Askari, p\. 209; Wafa’ al\-Wafa’, Vol\. 3, pp\. 999, 1000\-1001; Mu’jam al\- Buldan, Yaqut al\-Hamawi, Vol\. 4, p\. 239; Sharh, Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 16, pp\. 216, 219\-220, 274; Al\-Muhalla, Ibn Hazm, Vol\. 6, p\. 507; Al\-Sira al\-Halabiyya, Vol\. 3, p\. 361; At\-Tafsir, al\-Fakhr ar\-Radi, Vol\. 29, p\. 284\)\.

<a id="page798"></a>At this stage, the question arises that when Fatima’s possession of Fadak is admitted, as Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) also clarifies in this letter by saying, “We had Fadak in our possession,” what was the meaning of asking Fatima \(x\) to produce testimony in support for her

claim since the onus of proof does not lie on the person with the claim of ownership? The onus of proof lies on the person filing a counter claim, an objection, because possession itself constitutes a proof\. As such, it was Abu Bakr who was required to produce a proof to the lawfulness of his own taking the contested land from its owner\. In the case, if he is unable to do so, Fatima’s possession will mean an testimony of her lawful ownership\. As such, it will be wrong to ask her to produce some more proof or testimony on her own\.

It is strange that when other claims of this nature came before Abu Bakr, he arbitrated them in favor of the claimant merely on the basis of the claim: The claimant is neither asked to provide proof of his claim nor to produce witnesses\. Why did Abu Bakr apply a different standard in the case of “Sayyidatu Nisaa’ al\-‘Aalameen”? Did he hold the daughter of the Prophet \(k\) as a liar? Or did he have other political objectives in

mind when he treated her with such injustice? In this regard, the traditionists write the following: “It is related from Jabir ibn \`Abdillah al\-Ansari that he said that the Messenger of Allah \(k\) had said that when

the booty from Bahrain arrived, he would allow him such\-and\- such of it, but the booty did not arrive till the Prophet’s death\. When it arrived during the days of Abu Bakr, he went to the latter to claim it\. Abu Bakr made the announcement that whoever had a claim against the Messenger of Allah or against whomsoever he had made a promise should come for his claim\. So, I went to him and told him that the Prophet \(h\) had

promised to give me such \-and\- such property out of the booty from Bahrain whereupon he gave me all of that” \(Sahih, al \-Bukhari, Vol\. 3, pp\. 119, 209, 236; Vol\. 4, p\. 110; Vol\. 5, p\. 218; Sahih, Muslim, Vol\. 7, pp\. 75\- 76; Al\-Jami’ al\-Sahih, al\-Tirmidhi, Vol\. 5, p\. 129; Al \-Musnad, Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Vol\. 3, pp\. 307\-308; Al\-Tabaqat al\-Kubra, Ibn Sa\`d, Vol\. 2, part 2, pp\.88\-89\)\.

In the annotations of this tradition, Shihabud\-Din Ahmed ibn Ali \(Ibn Hajar\) al\-Asqalani ash\-Shafi’i \(773/1372\-852/1449\) and Badrud\-Din Mahmud ibn Ahmed al\-Ayni al\-Hanafi \(762/1361\-855/1451\) have written the following: “This tradition leads to the conclusion that the testimony of one equitable companion can be admitted as full testimony \[equal to two or more\] even though it may be in his own personal favor because Abu Bakr did not ask Jabir to produce any \[other\] witness to prove his claim\.

<a id="page799"></a>\(Fath al\-Bari fi Sharh Sahih al\-Bukhari, Vol\. 5, p\. 380; Umdatul\-Qari fi Sharh Sahih al\-Bukhari, Vol\. 12, p\. 121\)\.

If it is lawful to grant property to Jabir on the basis of good impression about him without calling for witness or testimony anyone at all, then what stopped allowing Fatima’s claim on the basis of similar good impressions? Or was Abu Bakr ’s impression of the Head of the Women of Mankind not good at all? If good impression could exist in the case of Jabir to such an extent that he would not benefit by speaking a lie, then why should there not be the good belief about Fatima \(x\) that she

would not attribute a false saying to the Prophet \(h\) just for a piece of

land? Firstly, her admitted truthfulness and honesty was enough for holding her truthful in her claim\. Moreover, the testimony of Ali and Umm Ayman in her favor was also available besides other evidences\. It has been said that the claim could not be decided in favor of Fatima \(x\)

on the basis of these two witnesses because the Holy Quran lays down the principle of testimony that: “\.\.\. \.then call to witness two witnesses from among your men and if there not be two men, then a man and two men” \(Holy Quran, 2: 282\)\.

If this principle is universal and general, then it should be taken into regard on every occasion, not selectively\. But on some occasions, it is found not to have been followed at all\. For example, when an Arab had a dispute with the Prophet \(h\) about a camel, Khuzaymah ibn Thabit al\-

Ansari gave testimony in favor of the Prophet \(h\), and this one single

witness was deemed to be equal to two because there was no doubt in the honesty and truthfulness of this individual in whose favor the testimony was led\. It was for this reason that the Holy Prophet \(h\) granted him the

title of “Dhul\-Shahadatayn” \(i\.e\. one whose testimony is equivalent to that of two\) \(al\-Bukhari, Vol\. 4, p\. 24; Vol\. 6, p\. 146; Abu Dawud, Vol\. 3, p\. 308; al\-Nisa’i, Vol\. 7, p\. 302; Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Vol\. 5, pp\. 188, 189, 216; Al\-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 2, p\. 448; Usd al\-Ghaba, Vol\. 2, p\. 114; Al \-Isaba, Vol\. 1, pp\. 425\-426; Al\-Musannaf, as\-Sanani, Vol\. 8, pp\. 366\-368\)\.

Consequently, neither was the generality of the verse about testimony affected by this action, nor was it deemed to be against the cannons of testimony\. So, if here, in view of the Prophet’s truthfulness, one testimony in his favor was deemed to be equal to two, then could not the testimony of Ali and Umm Ayman be regarded sufficient Fatima \(x\)

in view of her moral greatness and truthfulness? Besides, this verse does not show that there can be no other way of establishing a claim other than

<a id="page800"></a>these two methods\. In this regard, judge Nurullah al \-Mar’ashi at\-Tustari \(956/1549\-1019/1610\) has written the following in Ihqaq \-al\-Haqq, chapter on al\-Mata’in: “The view of the contention that Umm Ayman’s testimony remained incomplete is wrong on the grounds that from certain traditions, it is seen that it is lawful to give a decision on the basis of one single witness, and it does not necessarily mean that the injunction of the Holy Quran has been violated because this verse means that a decision can be given on the strength of the testimony of two men or one man and two women and that their testimony is enough\. From this, it does not appear that if there are some other grounds besides the testimony of witnesses that are unacceptable and that verdict cannot be given on its basis, unless it is argued that this is the only meaning for this verse\. But since every meaning is not a final argument, this notion can be brushed aside, particularly because the tradition clearly points to a contrary notion and ignoring the notion does not necessarily mean violating the verse\. Secondly, the verse allows a choice between the testimony of two men or that of one man and two women\. If, by virtue of the tradition, a third choice is added, namely that a verdict can be passed by means of other testimony as well, then how does it necessitate that the Quranic verse should stand violated?\!”

In any case, from this reply, it is clear that a claimant is not obligated to produce the testimony of two men or that of one man and two women in support for the claim\. This is so because if there is one witness and the claimant swears an oath, he can then be taken to have legitimacy in his claim and a decision can be given in his favor\. In this regard, it has been narrated by more than twelve companions of the Holy Prophet \(h\)

that the Messenger of Allah \(h\) used to decide cases on the strength of one single witness and the taking of an oath\.

It has been explained by some companions of the Prophet \(h\)

and by some scholars of jurisprudence that this decision is specially related to rights, property and transactions, and this decision was practiced by the three caliphs: Abu Bakr, \`Umar and Othman \(Muslim, Vol\. 5, p\. 128; Abu DawÅ d, Vol\. 3, pp\. 308\- 309; al\-Tirmidhi, Vol\. 3, pp\. 627\- 629; Ibn Majah, Vol\. 2, p\. 793; Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Vol\. 1, pp\. 248, 315, 323; Vol\. 3, p\. 305; Vol\. 5, p\. 285; Malik ibn Anas, Al\-Muwatta’, Vol\. 2, pp\. 721 \-725; al\-Bayhaqi, Al\-Sunan al\-Kubra, Vol\. 10, pp\. 167\-176; Al\-Sunan, al\-Dar Qutni, Vol\. 4, pp\. 212\-215; Majma’az\-Zawa’id, Vol\. 4, p\. 202; Kanz al\-\`Ummal, Vol\. 7, p\. 13\)\.

<a id="page801"></a>When decisions were issued based on the strength of one witness and one oath, then even if in Abu Bakr’s view the requirement of testimony was incomplete, he should have asked her to swear an oath then give a decision in her favor\. But here the very objective was to tarnish the image of truthfulness of Fatima \(x\) so that in the future the question of

her testimony should not arise\.

However, when Fatima’s claim was rejected in this manner and Fadak was not accepted as the Prophet’s gift to her, she claimed it on the basis of inheritance saying: “If you do not agree that the Prophet \(h\) had

gifted it to me, you cannot at least deny that Fadak and the revenues of Khaybar as well as the lands around Medina were the Prophet’s personal properties and I am his only heir\.” Yet she was deprived of her inheritance on the basis of a tradition related by Abu Bakr himself that the Holy Prophet \(h\) said, “We, prophets, have no successors, and whatever

we leave behind constitutes charity” \(al\-Bukhari, Vol\. 4, p\. 96; Vol\. 5, pp\. 25\-26, 115, 117; Vol\. 8, p\. 185; Muslim, Vol\. 5, pp\. 153 \-155; al\-Tirmidhi, Vol\. 4, pp\. 157 \-158; Abu Dawud, Vol\. 3, pp\. 142\- 143; al\-Nisa’i, Vol\. 7, p\. 132; Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Vol\. 1, pp\. 4, 6, 9, 10; al\-Bayhaqi, Vol\. 6, p\. 300; Ibn Sa\`d, Vol\. 2, part 2, pp\. 86\-87; al\-Tabari, Vol\. 1, p\. 1825; Tarikh al\-Khamis, Vol\. 2, pp\. 173\-174\)\.

Besides Abu Bakr, nobody else had any knowledge of this statement which was presented to the public as a tradition of the Prophet \(h\), nor had anyone from among the companions heard it at all\. Who is

the truthful one, Fatima \(x\) or Abu Bakr? Thus, Jalalu’d\-Din \`Abd ar\-

Rahman ibn Abu Bakr al\-Sayyuti ash\-Shafi’i \(849/1445\-911/1505\) and Shihabud\-Din Ahmed ibn Muhammad \(Ibn Hajar\) al\-Haytami ash\- Shafi’i \(909/1504\-974/1567\) have written the following: “After the death of the Prophet \(h\), there was a difference of opinion about inheritance and no

one had any information in this matter\. Then, Abu Bakr said that he had heard the Messenger of Allah saying, ‘We, prophets, leave no successors, and whatever we leave behind constitutes charity’” \(Tarikh al\-Khulafa’, p\.73; Al\-Sawa’iq al\-Muhriqa, p\. 19\)\.

The mind refuses to believe that the Prophet \(h\) should not tell

those individuals who could be deemed as his successors that they would not inherit and inform a third party that did not have even the most remote kinship to him, that there would be no heir/successor to him\. Is not AbÅ Bakr considered as a “successor” of the Prophet \(k\) by many people?\! Is there no contradiction here?\! Then this story was made public only when

<a id="page802"></a>the issue of Fadak was raised in the court of Abu Bakr who himself constituted the contesting party\! In such circumstances, how can his presenting in his own support a tradition which no one else at all had ever heard be deemed permissible? If it is argued that this tradition should be relied upon in view of the greatness of the status of Abu Bakr, then why can Fatima’s claim to the said gift not be relied upon because of her honesty and truthfulness, more so when the testimony of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and that of Umm Ayman, as well as of others as well, was

also in her favor? If necessity was felt to call more witnesses in her case, then testimony can also be called for regarding this alleged unheard\-of “tradition”, particularly since this “tradition” contradicted the general instructions of the Holy Quran relevant to the issue of succession and inheritance\. How can a tradition which is weak in the manner of its relating and altered and the authenticity of which is questioned on the basis of facts to the contrary be deemed to specify a generality of the Quranic injunction on inheritance/succession because the question of the inheritance of the prophets is clearly mentioned in the Holy Quran\. In this regard, Allah says the following: “\.\.\. And Solomon inherited David” \(Holy Quran, 27: 16\)\. So, prophets do leave heirs/successors\.\.\.

At another place, the following is stated by prophet Zakariyya: “\.\.\. Grant me from Yourself an heir who shall inherit me and inherit the family of Jacob” \(Holy Quran, 19: 5\-6\)\. So, prophets do leave heirs/successors\.\.\.

In these verses, succession refers to inheriting estates, etc\. To take it in its figurative meaning of succession in prophetic knowledge would not only be absurd but also against established facts because knowledge and Prophethood are not objects of succession, nor do they possess the quality of transmission through inheritance, for in that case, all the descendants of the prophets would have been prophets\. There is no sense in making a distinction that the progeny of some prophets may inherit Prophethood while others should remain deprived of it\. It is strange that the theory of transmission of Prophethood through inheritance is propagated by those who have always laid the objection against the Sh\`as that they regard the Imamate and the caliphate as an objective of inheritance and confined to one family only\. Would not Prophethood become an objective of inheritance by taking succession in this verse to mean succession to the Prophethood?

If, in Abu Bakr’s view, by virtue of this tradition, there could be no successor of the Prophet \(h\), then where was this tradition when a

<a id="page803"></a>document had been written admitting Fatima’s claim for succession? Thus, Nurud\-Din Ali ibn Ibrahim al\-Halabi ash\-Shafi’i \(975/1567\-1044/1635\) quotes Shamsu’d\-Din Yusuf \(Sibt ibn al\-Jawzi\) al\-Hanafi \(581/1185\-654/1256\) narrating the following: “Abu Bakr was on the pulpit when Fatima \(x\) came to him and said, ‘O Abu Bakr\! The Holy

Quran should allow your daughter to inherit you, yet I am not to inherit my father\!’ Abu Bakr started weeping and descended from the pulpit\. Then he wrote her a statement about Fadak\. At that time, Umar arrived and inquired what the written sheet was all about\. Abu Bakr replied, ‘It is a document which I have written for Fatima \(x\) about the inheritance

from her father\.’ Umar said, ‘What will you spend on the Muslims while the Arabs are waging war against you, as you see?’ Then Umar took the document and tore it to pieces” \(Al\-Sira al\-Halabiyya, Vol\. 3, pp\. 361\-362\)\.

Every sensible person who takes note of this behavior can easily reach the conclusion that this tradition is concocted and wrong\. It was fabricated only to secure possession of Fadak and other inheritances\. Consequently, Fatima \(x\) refused to accept it and expressed her anger in

this way: She made a will about Abu Bakr and \`Umar that the two should not participate in her funeral prayers\. Aisha narrated the following: “Fatima \(x\), the daughter of the Holy Prophet \(h\), sent for Abu Bakr

\(after he became caliph following the death of the Holy Prophet \(h\) claiming from him her inheritance left for her by the Messenger of Allah from what Allah had bestowed \(specifically\) upon him in Medna and Fadak and what was left from the fifth \(khums\) of the income from Khaybar\. Abu Bakr refused to hand over anything from it to Fatima \(x\)\.

Then, Fatima \(x\) became angry with Abu Bakr and forsook him and did

not talk to him till the end of her life\. When she died, her husband, Ali ibn Abu Talib, buried her at night\. He did not inform Abu Bakr about her death and performed the funeral prayers for her personally” \(al\-Bukhari, Vol\. 5, p\. 177; Vol\. 8, p\. 185; Muslim, Vol\. 5, pp\. 153\- 155; al\-Bayhaqi, Vol\. 4, p\. 29; Vol\. 6, pp\. 300\-301; Ibn Sa\`d, Vol\. 2, part 2, p\. 86; Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Vol\. 1, p\. 9; al\-Tabari, Vol\. 1, p\. 1825; Ibn Kathir, Tarikh, Vol\. 5, pp\. 285\-286; Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 6, p\. 46 and Wafa’ al\-Wafa’,Vol\. 3, p\. 995\)\.

In this regard, Umm Ja\`far, the daughter of Muhammad ibn Ja\`far, narrated the following about the request of Fatima \(x\), who was

nearing her death, to Asma’ daughter of \`Umays: “When I die, I want you and Ali to wash me and do not allow anyone to go into my house\.”

<a id="page804"></a>When she died, Aisha came to enter, but Asma’ said to her, “Do not enter\.” Aisha complained to Abu Bakr \(her father\) saying, “This Khath’amiyya \(woman from the tribe of Kath’am\) intervenes between us and the daughter of the Messenger of Allah \(h\)\.” Abu Bakr came out, stood at the door and said, “O Asma’\! What makes you prevent the wives of the Prophet \(h\) from entering to see the daughter of the Messenger of

Allah?” Asma’ replied, “She had herself ordered me not to allow anyone to enter\.” Abu Bakr said, “Do what she has ordered you” \(Hilyat al\-Awliya’, Vol\. 2, p\. 43; Al\-Sunan al\-Kubra, Vol\. 3, p\. 396; Vol\. 4, p\. 334; Ansab al\-Ashraf, Vol\. 1, p\. 405; Al\-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 4, pp\. 1897\-1898; Usd al\-Ghaba, Vol\. 5, p\. 524; Al\-Isaba, Vol\. 4, pp\. 378\-379\)\.

Fatima \(x\) had also made a request to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

that she must be buried at night, that no one should come to her, that Abu Bakr and Umar should not be notified about her death and burial, and that Abu Bakr should not be allowed to perform the funeral prayer for her\.

When she died, Ali washed and buried her in the dark of the night without notifying Abu Bakr and Umar\. So, these two were not aware of her burial\.

Muhammad ibn Umar al\-Waqidi \(130/747\-207/823\) said the following: “It has been proven to us that Ali \(x\) performed her funeral

prayers and buried her at night accompanied by al\-Abbas \(ibn Abdul\-Muttalib\) and \(his son\) al\-Fadl and did not notify anyone\.”

It was for this reason that the burial place of Fatima \(x\) is hidden

and is unknown, none alive is sure about it \(Al\-Mustadrak, Vol\. 3, pp\. 162\- 163; Al\-Musannaf, Vol\. 4, p\. 141; Ansab al\-Ashraf, Vol\. 1, pp\. 402, 405; Al\-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 4, p\. 1898; Usd al\-Ghaba, Vol\. 5, pp\. 524\-525; Al\-Isaba, Vol\. 4, pp\. 379\-380; al\-Tabari, Vol\. 3, pp\. 2435\-2436; Ibn Sa\`d, Vol\. 8, pp\. 19\-20; Wafa’ al\-Wafa’, Vol\. 3, pp\. 901\-902, 904, 905; Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 16, pp\. 279\-281\)\.

To attribute this displeasure of Fatima \(x\) to sentiments and

thereby to lower its importance does not prompt a correct sentiment: If this displeasure had been the result of sentiments, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) would have stopped her from this out\-of\-place displeasure, but

there is no historical record showing that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) took this displeasure to be as such\. Besides, how could her displeasure be

<a id="page805"></a>the result of personal feelings or sentiments since her pleasure or displeasure always agree with Allah’s will? The Prophet’s following saying is a proof of this: “O Fatima \(x\)\! Surely Allah is angered when you are angered and is pleased when you are pleased” \(Al\-Mustadrak, Vol\. 3,

1. 153; Usd al\-Ghaba, Vol\. 5, p\. 522; Al\-Isaba, Vol\. 4, p\. 366; Tahthib al\-Tahthib, Vol\. 12, p\. 441; Al\-Khasa’is al\-Kubra, Vol\. 2, p\. 265; Kanz al\-Ummal, Vol\. 13, p\. 96; Vol\. 16, p\. 280; Majma’ al\-Zawa’id, Vol\. 9, p\. 203\)\.

**A short history of Fadak after the death of Fatima \(x\):**

The motive which prompts us to pursue the history of Fadak and to extract the series of events after it for a period of three centuries from the texts of historical books is to clarify three issues:

a\. The truth about the rule of annulment of inheritance from prophets allegedly made by the Holy Prophet \(h\); in other words, the claim that property of the Holy Prophet \(h\) is a part of the public

treasury and belongs to all Muslims\. This was claimed by the first caliph, Abu Bakr, and was rejected by his successors, by both next caliphs \(\`Umar and Othman\), by the Umayyads and the Abbassids\. We must consider that the lawfulness and rightfulness of their caliphate depended upon the “correctness” and “lawfulness” of the caliphate of the first caliph and his actions\.

b\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and the descendants of Fatima \(x\) never had any hesitation regarding the rightfulness and justification of their claim\. They emphasized and confirmed that Fatima \(x\) had always

been right and that Abu Bakr’s claim had always been rejected; they did not yield to the false claim\.

c\. Whenever one of the caliphs made a decision to put Allah’s command into effect, with regard to Fadak, to observe justice and equity and to restore the right to the entitled one in conformity with Islamic rules, he used to return Fadak to the descendants of Fatima \(x\)\.

\`Umar ibn al\-Khattab was the most harsh person in keeping

Fatima \(x\) from Fadak and her inheritance as he himself confessed:

“When the Messenger of Allah died, I came along with Abu Bakr to Ali ibn Abu Talib and said, ‘What do you say about what has been left by the Messenger of Allah?’ He replied, ‘We have the most rights with the Holy

<a id="page806"></a>Prophet \(h\)\.’ I \(Umar\) said, ‘Even those properties of Khaybar?’ He

said, ‘Yes, even those of Khaybar\.’ I said, ‘Even those of Fadak?’ He replied, ‘Yes, even those of Fadak\.’ Then I said, ‘By Allah\! We say NO even if you cut our necks with saws’” \(Majma’ al\-Zawa’id, Vol\. 9, pp\. 39\-40\)\.

As it has been mentioned before, \`Umar then took the document \(title of ownership\) of Fadak and tore it up\. But when Umar became caliph \(13/634\-23/644\), he gave Fadak back to inheritors of the Holy Prophet \(h\)\. Yaqut al\-Hamawi \(574/1178\-626/1229\), the famous

historian and geographer, following the event of Fadak, said the following: “Then, when \`Umar ibn al \-Khattab became caliph and gained victories and the Muslims secured abundant wealth \(i\.e\. the public treasury satisfied the caliphate’s needs\), he made his judgement contrary to that of his predecessor\. He gave it \(Fadak\) back to the Prophet’s heirs\. At the time, Ali ibn Abu Talib and Abbas ibn Abdul\-Muttalib disputed about Fadak\.”

Ali said that the Holy Prophet \(h\) had bestowed it on Fatima \(x\) during his lifetime\. Abbas denied this and used to say, “This was in the possession of the Holy Prophet \(h\) and I have a share in this

inheritance\.” They were disputing this with each other and asked Umar to settle the case\. He refused to judge between them and said, “Both of you are more conscious and aware of your problem; but I only give it \[Fadak\] to you” \(Mu’jam al\-Buldan, Vol\. 4, pp\. 238\-239; Wafa’ al\-Wafa’, Vol\. 3,

1. 999; Tahthib al\-Lughah, Vol\. 10, p\. 124; Lisan al\-Arab, Vol\. 10, p\. 473; Taj al\-Arus, Vol\. 7, p\. 166\)\.

The reason why Umar and Abu Bakr were trying to seize Fadak was economic and political, not merely a religious one, as the previous episode shows\. When the economic and political condition of the caliphate improved, and when there was no need for the income obtained from Fadak, Omer changed his own decision\.

The last part of this historic event has been inserted afterwards to demonstrate the matter of inheritance by the brother or paternal uncle of the deceased when the latter had no sons\. This problem is a matter of dispute among Islamic sects\. The judicial and jurisprudential discussion is separate from our own goal in the writing of this book\. We are only discussing the matter historically\.

<a id="page807"></a>Abbas had no claim in this case because he had not proven that he had a share in this property, nor did his descendants consider it to be among their own assets even when they \[the Abbasides\] became caliphs and were ruling the Islamic lands\. They either considered themselves as owners of this estate in their capacity as caliphs, or they used to return it to the descendants of Fatima \(x\) when they had decided to be just

governors\.

When Othman ibn Affan became caliph, following the death of Umar \(23/644\-35/656\), he granted Fadak to Marwan ibn al\-Hakam, his cousin \(Al\-Sunan al\-Kubra, Vol\. 6, p\. 301; Wafa’ al\-Wafa’, Vol\. 3, p\. 1000; Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 1, p\. 198\) and this was one of the causes of hostile feelings among the Muslims against \`Othman \(Al\-Ma’arif, Ibn Qutaybah, p\. 195; Al\-Iqd al \-Farid, Vol\. 4, pp\. 283, 435; Tarikh, Abul\-Fida’, Vol\. 1, p\. 168; Tarikh, Ibn al\-Wardi, Vol\. 1, p\. 204\) which ended in the rebellion against him and in his murder\. “While previously Fatima \(x\)

used to claim it, sometimes as her inheritance and sometimes as a gift \(from her father\), she was driven away from it \(Fadak\) as Ibn Abul\-Hadid said” \(Sharh Nahjul\- Balagha\)\. In this way, Fadak fell into the possession of Marwan\. He used to sell its crops and products for at least ten thousand dinars per year\. If in some years its income decreased, this drop was not made public\. This was its usual profit till the time of the caliphate of Umar ibn Abdul\-Aziz \(in 100/718\) \(Ibn Sa\`d, Vol\. 5, pp\. 286, 287; Subh al\-A’sha, Vol\. 4, p\. 291\)\.

When Mu\`awiyah ibn Abu Sufyan became caliph \(41/661\-60/680\), he became partner with Marwan and others in Fadak\. He allotted one third to Marwan, one third to Amr son of Othman ibn Affan and one third to his own son Yazid\. This was after the death of al\-Hassan ibn Ali \(x\)\. “In order to cause the anger of the progeny of the Holy Prophet \(h\),

as al\-Ya\`qubi states on p\. 199, Vol\. 2 of his Tarikh, it remained in the possession of the three above\-mentioned persons tlil Marwan became caliph \(64/684\-65/685\); he took full possession of it\. Then he doled it out to his two sons, Abdul\-Malik and Abdul\-Aziz\. Then Abdul\-Aziz doled out his share to his son \(\`Umar ibn Abdul\-Azz\)\.

When Umar ibn Abdul\-Aziz became caliph \(99/717\-101/720\), he delivered a sermon once in which he said, “Verily, Fadak was among the things that Allah had bestowed on His Messenger and no horse, nor camel was stirred for it\.” He mentioned the history of the case of Fadak during the past caliphates till he said the following: “Then Marwan \[ibn al\-Hakam\] gave it \(Fadak\) to my father and to Abdul\-Malik\. It became mine

<a id="page808"></a>as well as al\-Walid’s and Sulayman’s \(two sons\)\. When al\-Walid became caliph \(86/705\- 96/715\), I asked him for his share and he gave it to me\. I also asked for Sulayman’s share and he, too, gave it to me\. Then I gathered the three parts and I then possessed no property more dear to me than it\. Testify that I returned it to its original condition\.” He wrote to his governor of Medina \(Abu Bakr ibn Muhammad ibn Amr ibn Hazm\) ordering him to carry out what he had declared in the sermon which he had delivered\. Then Fadak went back to the possession of the children of Fatima \(x\)\. “This was the first removal of oppression by returning it

\(Fadak\) to the children of Ali” \(Al\-Awa’il, Abu Hilal al\-Askari, p\. 209\)\.

They possessed it during the reign of this caliph \[Umar ibn Abd al\-Aziz\]\.

When Yazid ibn Abdul\-Malik became caliph \(101/720\-105/724\), he seized Fadak and they \(the children of Ali\) were again dispossessed\. It fell into the possession of the children of Marwan as it had been previously\. They passed it from one to another tlil their caliphate expired; it was then that it passed away to Banu al\-Abbas\.

When “Abul\-Abbas” Abdullah as\-Saffah became the first caliph of the Abbasid dynasty \(132/749\-136/754\), he gave Fadak back to the children of Fatima \(x\), handing it over to Abdullah ibn al\-Hassan ibn al\-Hassan \[known as al\-Hassan al\-Muthanna or al\-Hassan II\] ibn Ali ibn Abu Talib\(x\)\. When “Abu Ja\`far” Abdullah al\-Mansur ad\-Dawaniqi \(136/754\-158/775\) became caliph, he seized Fadak from the children of al\-Hassan \(x\)\. When Muhammad al\-Mahdi, son of al\-Mansur, became caliph \(158/775\-169/785\), he returned Fadak to the children of Fatima \(x\)\. Then Musa al\-Hadi ibn al\-Mahdi \(169/785\-170/786\) and his brother Harun ar\-Rashid \(170/786\-193/809\) confiscated it from the descendants of Fatima \(x\), and it found itself in the possession of Banu al\-Abbas till the time when al\-Ma’mun became caliph \(193/813\-218/833\)\. Al\-Ma’mun al\-Abbasi gave it back to the descendants of Fatima \(x\) \(210/826\)\. It is

narrated through al\-Mahdi ibn Sabiq that al\- Ma’mun one day sat to hear the complaints of the people and to judge in their disputes\. The first complaint which he received caused him to weep upon considering it\. When he asked where the attorney for the children of Fatima \(x\)

daughter of the Holy Prophet \(h\) was, an old man stood up and came

forth\. He argued with him about Fadak, and al\-Ma’mun, too, argued till he won the argument over al\- Ma’mun \(Al\-Awa’il, p\. 209\)\. Al \-Ma’mun summoned the Islamic faqihs and questioned them about the claim of Banu Fatima \(x\)\. They narrated to al\-Ma’mun saying that the Holy

<a id="page809"></a>Prophet \(h\) gave Fadak to Fatima \(x\) as a gift and that after the death of the Holy Prophet \(h\), Fatima \(x\) demanded Abu Bakr to return Fadak to

her\. He asked her to bring witnesses to her claim regarding this gift\. She brought Ali, al\-Hassan, al\-Hussain and Umm Ayman as her witnesses\. They testified in the case in her favor\. Abu Bakr rejected their testimony\. Then al\-Ma’mun asked the Islamic faqihs: “What is your view about Umm Ayman?” They replied, “She is a woman to whom the Holy Prophet \(h\) testified that she is a resident of Paradise\.” Al\-Ma’mun

disputed at length with them and forced them to accept his argument\. They finally confessed that Ali, al\-Hassan, al\-Hussain and Umm Ayman had testified only to the truth\. When they unanimously adopted this stand, he restored Fadak to the descendants of Fatima \(x\) \(Tarikh, al\-Ya\`qubi, Vol\. 3, pp\. 195\-196\)\.

Then al\-Ma’mun ordered the estate \(of Fadak\) to be registered among the property \(of the descendants of Fatima \[x\]\), and it was

registered; al\-Ma’mun signed it\. Then he wrote a letter to his governor in

Medina, namely Qutham ibn Ja\`far, as follows:

Be informed that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), exercising the authority vested upon him by the divine religion as the Caliph, successor and kinsman of the Holy Prophet \(h\), has considered himself more deserving to follow the precedent of the Holy Prophet \(h\) and to carry out his commands\. And \(the chief is more entitled\) to restore to the rightful persons any endowment gifted by the Holy Prophet \(h\) or anything which the Holy Prophet \(h\) had gifted to anyone\. The success and safeguarding of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) is done by Allah, and he is particularly anxious to act in a way which would win the pleasure of the Almighty for him\. Verily, the Holy Prophet \(h\) had gifted the estate of Fadak to his daughter Fatima \(x\)\. He had transferred its ownership to her\. It is a clear and an established fact\. None of the kindred of the Holy Prophet \(h\) have any difference of view in this regard\. Fatima \(x\)

always claimed that which was more deserving \(to be justified\) than the person \(Abu Bakr\) whose word was accepted\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(xn \) considers it right and proper to restore Fadak to the heirs of Fatima

\(x\)\. He would hereby win nearness to Allah Almighty by establishing His justice and right\. It will win the appreciation of the Holy Prophet \(h\) by carrying into effect his commandments\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib

<a id="page810"></a>\(x\) has commanded that this restoration of Fadak should duly be registered\. This command should be transmitted to all the officials\.

Then, if, as it was a custom to proclaim on every hajj gathering \(every year\), following the death of the Holy Prophet \(h\), that anyone to whom the Holy Prophet \(h\) had promised by way of a gift or a present should come forward, his statement will be accepted and the promise will thus be fulfilled\. Certainly, Fatima \(x\) had a superior right to have her statements accepted in the matter of the gifting of Fadak by the Holy Prophet \(h\) to her\.

Verily, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has commanded his slave Mubarak al\-Tabari to restore Fadak to the descendants of Fatima \(x\) the daughter of the Holy Prophet \(h\) with all its borders, rights and slaves attached thereto, cereal crops and other things\.

The same has been restored to Muhammad ibn Yahya ibn al\-Hassan ibn Zayd ibn Ali ibn al\-Hussain ibn Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and Muhammad ibn \`Abdullah ibn al\-Hassan ibn Ali ibn al\-Hussain ibn Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\.

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has appointed both of them as the agents representing the owners of the lands: the heirs of Fatima \(x\)\. Be then informed that this is the view of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and that Allah has inspired him to obey the order of Allah and to win His pleasure and the pleasure of the Holy Prophet \(h\)\. Let also your

subordinates know this\. Behave towards Muhammad ibn Yahya and Muhammad ibn Abdillah in the same manner as you used to behave towards Mubarak al \-Tabari\. Help them both to everything which has anything to do with its flourishing and prosperity, its improvement in abundance of cereals by Allah’s will, and that is the end of the matter\.

Written this Wednesday, two nights past Dhul\-Qi\`dah, in the year 210 \(February 15, 826 A\.D\.\)\.

During the period of al\-Ma’mun’s caliphate, Fadak was in the possession of Fatima’s descendants\. This continued during the caliphate of al\-Mu’tasim \(218/833\-227/842\) and that of al\-Wathiq \(227/842\-232/847\)\.

<a id="page811"></a>When Ja\`far al\-Mutawakkil became caliph \(232/847\-247/861\), the one among them who was marked as an arch\-enemy of the progeny of the Holy Prophet \(h\), both of those alive and of those dead, gave the

order to re\-seize Fadak from the descendants of Fatima \(x\)\. He seized it

and gave it to Harmalah al\-Hajjam \(the cupper\)\. After the death of al\-Hajjam, he gave it to al \-Bazyar \(the falconer, a native of Tabaristan\) \(Kashf al\-Ghumma, Vol\. 2, pp\. 121 \-122; Bihar al\-Anwar, \[1st ed\.\], Vol\. 8, p\. 108; Safinat al\-Bihar, Vol\. 2, p\. 351\)\. Abu Hilal al\-‘Askari mentioned that his name was \`Abdullah ibn \`Umar al\-Bazyar and added: “\.\.\. And there were in it \(Fadak\) eleven date\-palm trees which the Holy Prophet \(h\) had planted with his own hands\. The descendants of Abu

Talib used to gather these dates\. When pilgrims \(hujjaj\) entered Medina, these descendants donated the dates to them\. Through this, they received a considerable return\. This news reached al\-Mutawakkil\. He ordered Abdullah ibn Umar to gather the fruits and to squeeze the juice from them\. Abdullah ibn Umar sent a man named Bishr ibn Umayyah ath\-Thaqafi who squeezed the fruits\. It was reported that he made it into wine\. It had not reached Basra \(on its way to the caliph\) before it decayed, and by then al\-Mutawakkil was killed \(Al\-Awa’il, p\. 209\)\. When al\-Mutawakkil was killed and al\-Muntasir \(his son\) succeeded him \(247/861\-248/862\), the latter gave the order to restore Fadak to the descendants of al\-Hassan and al\-Hussain \(x\) and delivered the donations

of Abu Talib to them; this was in 248/862\. \(Ref\. Nos\. 3\-13, Fath al\-Buldan, Vol\. 1, pp\. 33\-38; Mu’jam al\- Buldan, Vol\. 4, pp\. 238\-240; Tarikh, al\-Ya\`qubi, Vol\. 2, p\. 199; Vol\. 3, pp\. 48, 195\-196; Al \-Kamil, Ibn al\-Athir, Vol\. 2, pp\. 224\-225; Vol\. 3, pp\. 457, 497; Vol\. 5, p\. 63; Vol\. 7,

1. 116; Al\-\`Iqd al\-Farid, Vol\. 4, pp\. 216, 283, 435; Wafa’ al\-Wafa’, Vol\. 3, pp\. 999\-1000; Al\-Tabaqat al\-Kubra, Vol\. 5, pp\. 286\-287; Tarikh al\-Khulafa’, pp\. 231\-232, 356; Muruj al\-Dhahab, Vol\. 4, p\. 82; Sirat Umar ibn Abdul\-Aziz, Ibn al\-Jawzi, p\. 110; Subh al\-A’sha, Vol\. 4, p\. 291; Jamharat Rasa’il al\-\`Arab, Vol\. 2, pp\. 331\-332; Vol\. 3, pp\. 509\-510; A’lam an\-Nisa’, Vol\. 3, pp\. 1211\-1212; Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 16, pp\. 277\-278; Al\-Awa’il, p\. 209; Kashf al\-Ghumma, Vol\. 2, pp\. 120\-122; Bihar al\-Anwar, Vol\. 8, pp\. 107\-108\)\.

It seemed that Fadak was re\-seized from the descendants of Fatima \(x\) after the death of al\-Muntasir \(248\-862\) because “Abul\-Hassan” Ali ibn Isa al\-Irbili \(d\. 692/1293\) stated that al\-Mu’tadid \(279/892\-289/902\) returned Fadak to the descendants of Fatima \(x\)\. Then he mentioned that al\-Muqtafi \(289/902\-295/908\) seized it from them\. It is

<a id="page812"></a>said also that al\-Muqtadir \(295/908\-320/932\) returned it to them \(the descendants of Fatima \[x\]\) \(Kashf al\-Ghumma, Vol\. 2, p\. 122; Bihar al\-Anwar, Vol\. 8, p\. 108; Safina, Vol\. 2, p\. 351\)\.

After this long period of re\-seizing and restoring, Fadak was returned to the possession of the usurpers and their heirs\. It seems there is no further mention that such changing hands was ever made in history, and the curtain fell\. “Is it then that the judgement of \(the times of pagan\) ignorance that they desire? And who \(else\) can be better than Allah to judge for a people of assured faith?” \(Holy Quran, 5: 50\)\.

**Letter 46**

**To One of his Officers**

Now, you are surely one of those whose help I accept in establishing religion and with those help I break the haughtiness of the sinful and guard critical borders\. You should seek Allah’s help in whatever causes you anxiety\. Add a little harshness to the mixture of leniency and remain lenient where leniency is more appropriate\. Adopt harshness when you cannot do without harshness\. Bend your wings \(in humbleness\) before the subjects\. Meet them with your face broad and keep yourself lenient \(in behavior\) with them\. Treat them equally in looking at them with half eyes or full eyes, in signaling and in greeting so that the great should not expect transgression on your part and the weak should not lose hope in your justice, and that is the end of the matter\.

**Will 47**

**For Imam Al\-hasan and Imam al\-Hussain \(x\) When \(\`Abd**

**ar\-Rahman\) Ibn Muljim \(the Curse of Allah be upon him\) Struck Him Fatally with His Sword**

I admonish you \(both\) to fear Allah and not to hanker after the \(pleasures of this\) world even though it may run after you\. Do not be sorry for anything of this world that you may have been denied\. Speak the truth and deed \(in expectation\) for \[the divine\] reward\. Be an enemy of the oppressor and the helper of the oppressed\.

I admonish you \(both\) as well as all my children and the members of my family and everyone whom my writing reaches to fear Allah, to keep your affairs in order and to maintain good relations among

<a id="page813"></a>yourselves for I have heard your grandfather \(the Holy Prophet \[h\]\)

saying, “Improvement of mutual differences is better than general prayers and fast\.”

\(Fear\) Allah \(and\) keep Him in view with regard to orphans\. So, do not allow them to starve, and they should not be ruined in your presence\.

\(Fear\) Allah \(and\) keep Him in view with regard to your neighbors because they were the subject of the Prophet’s advice\. He went on advising in their favor till we thought he would allow them to inherit them\.

\(Fear\) Allah \(and\) keep Him in view with regard to the issue of the Holy Quran\. No one should excel you in acting upon it\.

\(Fear\) Allah \(and\) keep Him in view in the matter of prayer because it is the pillar of your religion\.

\(Fear\) Allah \(and\) keep Him in view in the matter of your Lord’s House \(Ka\`ba\)\. Do not forsake it so long as you live because if it is abandoned, you will not be spared\.

\(Fear\) Allah \(and\) keep Him in view in the matter of jihad with the help of your property, lives and tongues in the way of Allah\.

You should maintain respect for kinship and spend on others\. Avoid turning away from one another and severing mutual relations\. Do not give up bidding for good and forbidding from evil lest the mischievous gain positions over you, then if you pray, your prayers will not be answered\.

Then he said the following: O sons of \`Abdul\- Muttalib\! Certainly I do not wish to see you plunging harshly into the blood of Muslims shouting that Ali ibn Abu Talib has been killed\. Beware\! Do not kill on my account except the one who kills me\.

Wait till I die by his \(Ibn Muljim’s\) existing stroke\. Then strike him one single stroke for his single stroke and do not dismember the limbs of the man, for I have heard the Messenger of Allah saying, “Avoid cutting limbs even though it may be those of a rabid dog\.”

<a id="page814"></a>**Letter 48**

**To Mu\`awiyah**

Surely, rebellion and falsehood abase a man in his religious as well as worldly matters and manifest his shortcomings before his critic\. You know that you cannot take hold of what is destined to remain away from you\. Many people had aims other than right \(ones\) and swear by Allah \(that they will attain their goal\), but He proved them wrong\. Therefore, fear the Day when happy is whoever made his end happy \(by good actions\) while repentant is whoever allowed Satan to lead him and did not resist him\. You called us to a settlement through the Holy Quran although you were not a man of the Holy Quran; we responded to the Holy Quran through its judgement and not to you, and that is the end of the matter\.

**Letter 49**

**To Mu\`awiyah**

This world turns away from the next\. Whoever is devoted to it achieves nothing from it except that it increases his greed and coveting\. Whoever is devoted to it is not satisfied with what he gets from it because of what he has not had\. Eventually, there will be a separation from what has been amassed and a breaking of what has been strengthened\. If you learn a lesson from the past, you can be safe in the future, and that is the end of the matter\.

**Letter 50**

**To the Officers of His Army**

From the servant of Allah, Ali ibn Abu Talib, to the Officer\-in\-charge of garrisons:

It is obligatory on an officer that the distinction which he achieves, or the wealth with which he has been exclusively endowed, should not make him change his behavior towards those under him, and that the riches which Allah has bestowed on him should increase him in nearness to his people and kindness to his brethren\.

<a id="page815"></a>Beware that it is obligatory on me that I should not keep anything secret from you except during war time, nor should I decide any matter without consulting you except with regard to the commands of the creed, nor should I ignore the fulfillment of any of your rights, nor should I desist till I discharge it fully, and that for me all of you should be equal in rights\. Once I have done all this, it becomes obligatory on you to thank Allah for this bounty and to obey me, and you should not hold back when called upon, nor should you jeopardize your good deeds\. You should face hardships for the sake of what is right\. If you do not remain steadfast in this, there will be no one more humiliated in my view than the one among you who has deviated, then I will increase his penalty wherein no one will get any concession from me\. Take this \(pledge\) from your \(subordinate\) officers and accord to them such behavior from your side by which Allah may improve your matters, and that is the end of the matter\.

**Letter 51**

**To His \(Land\) Tax Collectors :**

From the servant of Allah, Ali ibn Abu Talib, to the tax collectors:

Whoever does not fear where he is going does not send forward for himself that which can protect him\. You should know that the obligations laid on you are few, while their reward is much\. Even if there had been no fear of punishment for rebellion and disobedience, which Allah has prohibited, the reward in keeping aloof from it will be enough \(incentive\) to abstain from going after it\. Conduct yourselves justly with the people and deel with them with endurance with regard to their needs because you are the treasurers of the people, the representatives of the community and the ambassadors of the Imams\.

Do not deprive anyone of his needs and do not prevent him from \(securing\) his requirements\. For the collection of tax \(khiraj\) from the people, do not sell their winter or summer clothes nor cattle with which they work nor slaves\. Do not whip anyone for the sake of one dirham\. Do not touch the property of any person whether he be one who prays \(a Muslim\), or a protected unbeliever, unless you find a horse or weapons used to attack the Muslims because it is not proper for the Muslims to leave these things in the hands of the enemies of Islam to enable them to have power over Islam\.

<a id="page816"></a>Do not deny good counsel to yourself, good behavior to the army, succour to the subjects and strength to the religion of Allah\. Strive in the way of Allah as is obligatory on you because Allah, the Glorified One, desires us and you to be thankful to Him as best as we can and that we should support His Cause to the best of our ability\. And there is no power save with Allah, the all\-High, the all\-Glorious\.

**Letter 52**

**To the Governors of Various Places Concerning Prayers**

Offer the zuhr \(noon\) prayers with the people when the shade of the wall of the goats’ pen is equal to the wall\. Offer the asr \(afternoon\) prayers with them when the sun is still shining in a portion of the day enough for covering the distance of two farasangs \(about six miles\)\. Offer the maghrib \(sunset\) prayers when whoever is fasting ends the fast and the pilgrim rushes \(from Arafat\) to Mina\. Offer the isha’ \(evening\) prayers with them when twilight disappears and upto one third of the night\. Say the \(early\) morning prayers with them when a man can recognize the face of his companion\. Say the prayers with the people as the weakest of them would do, and do not be a source of trouble to them\.

**Document 53**

**Written for \(Malik\) al\-Ashtar an\-Nakh\`i, when the status of Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr had become precarious and Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had appointed al\-Ashtar as the Governor of Egypt and**

**the surrounding areas\. It is the longest document and contains the greatest number of beautiful statements :**

In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful\.

This is what Allah’s servant Ali ibn Abu Talib has ordered Malik ibn al\-Harith al\-Ashtar in his instrument \(of appointment\) for him when he made him Governor of Egypt for the collection of its revenues, fighting its enemies, seeking the good of its people and making its cities prosperous\.

He has ordered him to fear Allah, to prefer obedience to Him and to follow what He has commanded in His Book \(Holy Quran\) out of His obligatory and elective commands, without following which one cannot achieve virtue, nor \(can one\) be evil save by opposing them and ignoring

<a id="page817"></a>them and to support the cause of Allah the Glorified One, with his heart, hand and tongue because Allah Whose name is Sublime takes the responsibility for helping him who helps Him and for protecting him who gives Him support\.

He also orders him to break his heart off from passions and to restrain it at the time of their increase because the heart leads towards evil unless Allah has mercy\.

**Qualifications of a Governor and his Responsibilities :**

Then, know, O Malik, that I have sent you to an area where there have been governments before you, both just as well as oppressive\. People would now watch your dealings as you used to watch the dealings of the rulers before you and they \(people\) would criticize you as you criticized them \(rulers\)\. Surely, the virtuous are known by the reputation that Allah circulates for them through the tongues of His creatures\. Therefore, the best collection with you should be the collection of good deeds\. So, control your passions and check your heart from doing what is not lawful for you because checking the heart means detaining it just half way between what it likes and dislikes\.

Habituate your heart to mercy for the subjects and to affection and kindness for them\. Do not stand over them like greedy beasts who feel it is enough to devour them since they are of two kinds: either your brethren in religion or your likes in creation\. They would commit slips and encounter mistakes\. They may act wrongly, wilfully or out of negligence\. So, extend to them your forgiveness and pardon them in the same way as you would like Allah to extend His forgiveness and to pardon you because you are over them and your responsible Commander \(Imam\) is over you, while Allah is over the one who appointed you\. He \(Allah\) has sought you to manage their affairs and tried you through them\.

Do not set yourself to fight Allah because you have no power to meet His power and you cannot do without His pardon and mercy\. Do not regret forgiving or being merciful in punishing\. Do not act hastily during your anger if you can find a way out of it\. Do not say: “I have been given authority, I enjoy it when I order,” because it engenders confusion in the heart, weakens the religion and takes one to his ruin\. If the authority in which you are placed produces pride or vanity in you, look at the greatness of the realm of Allah over you and His might the like of which you do not even possess over yourselves\. This will curb your haughtiness,

<a id="page818"></a>cure you of your high temper and bring back to you your wisdom which had gone away from you\.

Beware of comparing yourself to Allah in His greatness or likening yourself to Him in His power, for Allah humiliates every claimant of power and disgraces everyone who is haughty\.

Do justice for Allah, and do justice towards the people, as against your own selves, your near ones and those of your subjects for whom you have a liking because if you do not do so, you will be oppressive, and when a person oppresses the servants of Allah, instead of His creatures, Allah becomes his opponent and when Allah is the opponent of a person He tramples his plea, and we would remain in the status of being at war with Allah till he gives it up and repents\. Nothing is more inducive to the reversal of Allah’s bounty or for the hastening of His retribution than continuance in oppression because Allah hears the prayer of the oppressed and is on the look out for the oppressors\.

**Ruling should be in favor of the people as a whole \.**

The way most coveted by you should be that which is the most equitable for what is right, the most universal by way of justice and the most comprehensive with regard to the agreement with those under you because the disagreement among the common people sweeps away the arguments of the chiefs and can be disregarded when compared with the agreement of the common people\. No one among those under you is more burdensome to the ruler in the comfort of life, less helpful in distress, more disliking of equitable treatment, more tricky in asking favors, less thankful at the time of giving, less appreciative of reasons at the time of refusal and weaker in endurance at the time of the discomforts of life than the chiefs\. It is the common people of the community who are the pillars of the religion, the power of the Muslims and the defence against the enemies\. Your learning should, therefore, be towards them and your inclination with them\.

The one among the people under you who is furthest from you and the worst of them in your view should be whoever is the most inquisitive of the shortcomings of the people because people do have shortcomings and the ruler is the most appropriate person to cover them\. Do not disclose whatever of it is hidden from you because your obligation is to correct what is manifest to you, while Allah will deal with whatever is hidden from you\. Therefore, cover shortcomings as far as you can; Allah will cover those of your shortcomings which you will like to remain

<a id="page819"></a>under cover from your subjects\. Unfasten every knot of hatred in the people and cut away from yourself the cause of every enmity\. Feign ignorance from what is not clear to you\. Do not hasten to second a backbiter because a backbiter is a cheat although he looks like those who wish well\.

**About Counselors**

Do not include among those whom you consult a miser who would keep you back from being generous and caution you against destitution, nor a coward who would make you feel too weak for your affairs, nor a greedy person who would beautify for you the collection of wealth by evil means\. This is so because although miserliness, cowardice and greed are different qualities, yet they are common in having a wrong idea about Allah\.

The worst minister for you is one who has been a minister for mischievous persons before you and who joined them in committing sins\. Therefore, he should not be your chief man because they are abettors of sinners and brothers of the oppressors\. You can find good substitutes for them who would be like them in their views and influence while not being like them in committing sins and vices\. They have never assisted an oppressor in his oppression or a sinner in his sins\. They would give you the least trouble and the best support\. They would be most considerate towards you and the least inclined towards others\. Therefore, make them your chief companions in privacy as well as in public\.

Then, more preferable among them for you should be those who openly speak better truths before you and who support you the least in those of your actions which Allah does not approve in His friends, even though they may be according to your wishes\. Associate yourself with God\-fearing and truthful people; then educate them, so that they should not praise you or please you by reason of an action which you did not perform because an excess of praise produces pride and drives you nearer to haughtiness\.

The virtuous and the vicious should not be in equal status before you because this means dissuasion of the virtuous from virtue and persuasion of the vicious to vice\. Keep everyone in the status which is his\. You should know that the most conducive thing for the good impression of the ruler on his subjects is that he should extend good behavior towards them, lighten their hardships and avoid putting them to unbearable troubles\. You should, therefore, in this way follow a course by which you

<a id="page820"></a>would leave a good impression with your subjects\. This is so because such good ideas would relieve you of great worries\. Certainly, the most appropriate for your good impression is he to whom your behavior has not been good\.

Do not discontinue the good lives in which the earlier people of this community had been acting and by virtue of which there was general unity and through which the subjects prospered\. Do not innovate any line of action which injures these earlier ways because \(in that case\) the reward for those who had established those ways would continue, but the burden for discontinuing them would be on you\. Keep on increasing your conversations with the scholars and discussions with the wise in order to stabilize the prosperity of the areas under you and to continue with that in which the earlier people had remained steadfast\.

**The different classes of people**:

Be informed that people consist of classes who prosper only with the help of one another and they are not independent of one another\. Among them are the army of Allah, then the secretarial workers of the common people and the chiefs, then the dispensers of justice, then those engaged in enforcing law and order, then the payers of head tax \(jizya\) and land tax \(khiraj\) from the protected unbelievers and the common Muslims, then there are the traders and the men of industry, then the lowest class of the needy and the destitute\. Allah has fixed the share of each one of them and laid down His precepts about the limits of each in His Book \(Holy Quran\) and in the Sunnah of His Prophet \(h\) by way of

a settlement which is preserved with us\.

The army is, by the will of Allah, the fortress of the subjects, the ornament of the ruler, the strength of the religion and the means of achieving peace\. The subjects cannot exist without them while the army can be maintained only by the funds fixed by Allah in the revenues through which they acquire the strength to fight the enemies, on which they depend for their prosperity and with which they meet their needs\. These two classes cannot exist without the third class, namely: the judges, the executives and the secretaries who pass judgements about contracts, collect revenues and are depended upon in special and general matters\.

And these classes cannot exist except with the traders and men of industry who provide necessities for them, establish markets and make it possible for others not to do all this with their own hands\. Then comes the

<a id="page821"></a>lowest class of the needy and the destitute\. Support and help for them is an obligation, and everyone of them has \(a share in\) livelihood in the Name of Allah\. Everyone of them has a right on the ruler according to what is needed for his prosperity\. The ruler cannot acquit himself of the obligations laid on him by Allah in this matter except by striving and seeking help from Allah,October 18, 2003 by training himself to adhere to righteousness and by enduring on that account all that is light or hard\.

**1\. The Army**

Put in command of your forces the man who in your view is the best well\-wisher of Allah, His Prophet \(h\) and your Imam\. The most

chaste of them in heart and the highest of them in endurance is one who is slow in getting angry, who accepts excuses, who is kind to the weak and is strict with the strong; violence should not raise his temper and weakness should not keep him sitting\.

Also associate with considerate people from high families, virtuous houses and decent traditions, then people of courage, valor, generosity and benevolence because they are repositories of honor and springs of virtues\. Strive for their matters as the parents strive for their child\. Do not regard anything that you do to strengthen them as big nor anything that you have agreed to do for them as little, even though it may be small because this would make them your well\-wishers and create a good impression about you\. Do not neglect to attend to their small matters\. Confine yourself to their important matters because your small favors will also be of benefit to them while the important ones are such that they cannot ignore\.

That commander of the army should have such a status before you that he renders help to them equitably and spends from his money on them and on those of their families who remain behind so that all their worries converge on the one worry to fight the enemy\. Your kindness to them would turn their hearts to you\. The most pleasant thing for the rulers is the establishment of justice in their areas and the manifestation of the love of their subjects, but the subjects’ love manifests itself only when their hearts are clean\. Their good wishes prove correct only when they surround their commanders \(to protect them\)\. Do not regard their positions to be a burden over them and do not keep watching for the end of their tenure\. Therefore, be broad\-minded with regard to their desires, continue to praise them and recount the good deeds of those who have shown such deeds because the mention of good deeds shakes the brave and rouses the weak, if Allah so wills\.

<a id="page822"></a>Appreciate the performance of each and every one of them\. Do not attribute the performance of one to the other and do not minimize the reward below the level of the performance\. The high status of a man should not lead you to regard his small deeds as big, nor should the low status of a man make you regard his big deeds as small\.

Refer to Allah and His Prophet \(h\) the affairs which worry you

and the matters which seem to confuse you because, addressing the people whom Allah the Sublime wishes to guide, He said the following: “O you who believe\! Obey Allah and obey the Prophet \(h\) and those vested with authority from among you; then if you quarrel about anything, refer it to Allah and the Prophet \(h\) if you believe in Allah and in the Last Day \(of Judgement\)” \(Holy Quran, 4: 59\)\.

Referring to Allah means acting according to what is clear in His Book, and referring to the Prophet \(h\) means following his unanimously agreed upon Sunnah with regard to which there are no differences\.

**2\. The Chief Judge \[Supreme Court Justice\]**

For the settlement of disputes among people, select one who is the most distinguished among your subjects in your view\. The cases \(coming before him\) should not vex him, disputation should not enrage him\. He should not insist on any wrong point and should not hesitate to accept the truth when he perceives it; he should not lean towards greed and should not content himself with a cursory understanding \(of a matter\) without going thoroughly into it\. He should be most ready to stop \(to ponder\) on doubtful points, most considerate of arguments, least disgusted at the quarrel of litigants, most patient at probing into matters and most fearless at the time of passing a judgement\. Praise should not make him vain and elation should not make him lean \(toward any side\)\. Such people are very few\.

Then, very often check his decisions and allow him so much money \(as remuneration\) that he has no excuse worth hearing \(for not being honest\) and there remains no occasion for him to go to others for his needs\. Give him that rank in your audience for which no one else among your chiefs aspires so that he may remain safe from the harm of those around you\. You should have a piercing eye in this matter because this religion has formerly been a prisoner in the hands of vicious persons when action was taken according to passion and worldly wealth was sought\.

<a id="page823"></a>**3\. Executive Officers**

Look into the affairs of your executives\. Give them appointment after testing them and do not appoint them according to partiality or favoritism because these two things make up the sources of injustice and unfairness\. Select from among them those who are people of experience and modesty, hailing from virtuous houses, having been previously in Islam because such persons possess high manners and untarnished honor\. They are the least inclined towards greed and always have their eyes on the ends of matters\.

Give them an abundant livelihood \(by way of salary\) because this gives them the strength to maintain themselves in order and not to have an eye upon the funds in their custody and it will be an argument against them if they disobeyed your orders or misappropriated your trust\. You should also check their activities and assign people to report on them who should be truthful and faithful because your watching their actions secretly would urge them to preserve trust with and to be kind to the people\. Be careful of assistants\. If any one of them extends his hands towards misappropriation and the reports of your reporters reaching you confirm it, that should be regarded as sufficient testimony\. You should then inflict corporal punishment on him and recover what he has misappropriated\. You should put him in a place of disgrace, blacklist him with \(the charge of\) misappropriation and make him wear the necklace of shame for his offence\.

**4\. The Administration of Revenues**

Look after the revenue \(khiraj, land tax\) affairs in such a way that those engaged in it remain prosperous because in their prosperity lies the prosperity of all others\. The others cannot prosper without them because all people are dependent on the revenue and on its payers\. You should also keep an eye on the cultivation of the land more than on the collection of revenue because revenue cannot be obtained without cultivation and whoever asks for revenue without cultivation ruins the area and brings death to the people\. His rule will not last but only for a moment\.

If they complain of the heaviness \(of the revenue\) or of diseases, or of scarcity of water, or of an excess of water, or of a change in the condition of the land either due to flood or to drought\.\.\., you should remit the revenue to the extent that you hope would improve their status\. The remission granted by you for the removal of distress from them should not be grudged by you because it is an investment which they will return to

<a id="page824"></a>you in the shape of the prosperity of your country and the progress of your domain in addition to earning their praise and happiness for meting out justice to them\. You can depend upon their strength because of the investment made by you in them through catering to their convenience and can have confidence in them because of the justice extended to them by being kind to them\. After that, circumstances may so turn that you may have a need for their assistance\. It is then that they will bear it happily, for prosperity is capable of bearing whatever you load on it\. The ruin of the land is caused by the poverty of the cultivators, while the cultivators become poor when the officers concentrate on the collection \(of money\), having little hope for continuance \(in their posts\) and deriving no benefit from warnings\.

**5\. The Clerical Establishment**

Then you should take care of your secretarial workers\. Put the best of them in charge of your affairs\. Entrust those of your writings which contain your policies and secrets to him who possesses the best character, who is not elated by honors lest he should dare speak against you in public\. He should also not be negligent in presenting the communications of your officers before you and issuing correct replies to them on your behalf and in matters of your receipts and payments\. He should not make any damaging agreement on your behalf and should not fail in repudiating an agreement against you\. He should not be ignorant of the extent of his own status in matters because whoever is ignorant of his own status is \(even\) more ignorant of the status of others\.

Your selection of these people should not be on the basis of your understanding \(of them\), confidence and good impression because people catch the ideas of the officers through affectation and personal service, and there is nothing in it which is like well\-wishing or trustfulness\. You should rather test them by what they did under the virtuous people before you\. Take a decision in favor of one who has a good name among the common people and is the most renowned in trustworthiness because this will be a proof of your regard for Allah and for him on whose behalf you have been appointed to this status \(namely your Imam\)\. Establish one chief for every department of work\. He should not be incapable of big matters and a rush of work should not perplex him\. Whenever there is a defect in your secretaries which you overlook, then you will be held responsible for it\.

<a id="page825"></a>**6\. Traders and Industrialists**

Take some advice about traders and industrialists\. Give them good counsel whether they are settled \(shop\-keepers\) or traders or physical laborers because they are the sources of profit and the means of the provision of useful items\. They bring them from distant and far\- flung areas throughout the land and the sea, the plains or the mountains, from where people cannot come and to where they do not dare to go, for they are peaceful and there is no fear of rebellion from them and they are quite without fear of treason\.

Look after their affairs before those of your own wherever they may be in your land\. Be informed, along with this, that most of them are very narrow\-minded and awfully avaricious\. They hoard goods for profiteering and fixing high prices for goods\. This is a source of harm to the people and a blot on the officers in charge\. Stop people from hoarding because the Messenger of Allah \(k\) has prohibited it\. The sale should be

smooth, with correct weights and prices, not harmful to either party, the seller or the buyer; whoever commits hoarding after you prohibit it, give him exemplary but not excessive punishment\.

**7\. The Lowest Class**

\(Fear\) Allah and keep Him in view with regard to the lower class which consists of those who have few means: the poor, the destitute, the penniless and the disabled because in this class are both the discontented and those who beg\. Take care for the sake of Allah of His obligations towards them for which He has made you responsible\. Fix for them a share from the public funds and a share from the crops of lands taken over as booty for Islam in every area because in it the remote ones have the same shares as the near ones\. All these people are those whose rights have been placed in your charge\. Therefore, a luxurious life should not keep you away from them\. You cannot be excused for ignoring small matters simply because you were deciding big ones\. Consequently, do not be unmindful of them, nor should you turn your face away from them out of vanity\.

Take care of the affairs of those of them who do not approach you because they are of unsightly appearance or those whom people regard as low\. Appoint for them some trusted people who are God\-fearing and humble\. They should inform you of these people’s conditions\. Then deal with them with a sense of responsibility to Allah on the Day you will meet Him because of all the subjects these people are the most worthy of

<a id="page826"></a>an equitable treatment, while for others also you should fulfil their rights so as to render account to Allah\.

Take care of the orphans and the aged who have no means \(for livelihood\) nor are they ready for begging\. This is heavy on the officers; in fact, every obligation is heavy\. Allah lightens it for those who seek the next world, so they endure \(hardships\) upon themselves and trust on the truthfulness of Allah’s promise to them\. And fix a time for complainants wherein you make yourself free for them and sit with them in common audience and feel humble for the sake of Allah Who created you\. \(On that occasion\) you should keep away your army and assistants such as the guards and the police so that anyone who likes to speak may speak to you without fear because I have heard the Messenger of Allah say in more than one place, “The people among whom the right of the weak is not secured from the strong without fear will never achieve purity\.” Tolerate their awkwardness and inability to speak\. Keep away from you narrowness and haughtiness; by the will of Allah, on this account spread over you the covers of His mercy and be optimistic of the reward of His obedience\. Whatever you give, give it joyfully, but when you refuse, do it handsomely and with apologies\.

Then there are certain matters which you cannot avoid performing yourself\. For example, relying on your officers when your secretaries are unable to do so, or tending to the complaints of the people when your assistants refrain\. Finish every day the work meant for it because every day has its own work\. Keep for yourself the better and greater portion of these periods for the worship of Allah, although all these items are for Allah provided the intention is pure and the subjects prosper thereby\.

**Communion with Allah**

The particular thing by which you should purify your religion for Allah should be the fulfillment of those obligations which are especially for Him\. Therefore, devote to Allah some of your physical activity during the night and the day and whatever \(worship\) you perform for seeking nearness to Allah should be complete, without defect or deficiency, no matter what physical exertion it may involve\. When you lead the prayers for the people, it should be neither \(too long as to be\) boring nor \(too short as to be\) wasteful because among the people there are the sick as well as those who have needs of their own\. When the Messenger of Allah \(k\) sent me to Yemen, I inquired how I should pray with them and he

<a id="page827"></a>replied, “Say the prayers as the weakest of them will say, and be considerate of the believers\.

**On the Behavior and Action of a Ruler**

Do not stay secluded from the public for a long time because the seclusion of those in authority from the subjects is a norm of narrow\-sightedness, and it causes ignorance of their affairs\. Seclusion from them also prevents them from the knowledge of those things which they need to know\. As a result, they begin to regard big matters as small and small matters as big, good matters as bad and bad matters as good, while the truth is confused with falsehood\. After all, a governor is a human being and cannot have knowledge of things which people keep hidden from him\.

No writ is big on the face of truth to differentiate its various expressions from falsehood\. You can be one of two kinds of men: If you are generous in granting rights, why this hiding in spite of \(your\) discharging the obligations and good deeds which you perform? Or you may be a victim of miserliness\. In that case, people will soon give up asking you since they will lose hope of a generous treatment from you\. In spite of that, there are many needs of the people towards you which do not involve any hardship on you, such as the complaint against oppression or the request for justice in a case\.

Furthermore, a governor has favorites and people of easy access to him\. They misappropriate things\. They are high\-handed and do not observe justice in matters\. You should destroy the root of evil in the people by cutting away the causes of these defects\. Do not make any land grants to your hangers \-on or supporters\. They should not expect from you the possession of land which may cause harm to adjoining people over the question of irrigation or public services whose burden the grantees place on others\. In this way, the benefit will be rather theirs than yours and the blame will lie on you in this world as well as in the next\.

Effect equity to whomsoever it is due, whether near you or far from you\. In this matter, you should be enduring and watchful even though it may involve your relatives and favorites\. Keep in view the reward of that which appears burdensome on you because its reward is surely handsome\.

If the subjects suspect you of high\-handedness, explain to them your status publicly and remove their suspicion with such an explanation

<a id="page828"></a>because this will mean an exercise for your soul and a consideration for the subjects while this explanation will secure your aim of keeping them firm in the truth\.

Do not reject peace to which your enemy may invite you and wherein there is the pleasure of Allah because peace brings rest to your army, relief from your worries and safety for your country\. But after peace there is a great apprehension from the enemy because often the enemy offers peace in order to benefit from your negligence and relaxation\. Therefore, be cautious and do not act according to your wishful thinking in this regard\.

If you conclude an agreement between yourself and your enemy or enter into a pledge, fulfil your agreement and carry out your pledge faithfully\. Place yourself as a shield against whatever you have pledged because among the obligations of Allah there is nothing on which people are more strongly united, despite the difference of their ideas and variation of their views, than respect for fulfilling pledges\. Besides Muslims, even unbelievers have abided by agreements because they realized the dangers which will come in the wake of the violation thereof\. Therefore, do not deceive your enemy because no one can offend Allah save the ignorant and the wicked\. Allah made His agreement and pledged the sign of security which He has spread over His creatures through His mercy and an asylum in which they stay in His protection and seek the benefit of nearness to Him\. Hence, there should be no deception, cunning or duplicity in it\.

Do not enter into an agreement which may admit different interpretations and do not change the interpretation of vague words after the conclusion and confirmation \(of the agreement\)\. If an agreement of Allah involves you in hardship, do not seek its repudiation without justification because the bearing of hardships through which you expect relief and a handsome result is better than a violation the consequence of which you fear, and that you fear you will be called upon by Allah to account for it and you will not be able to seek forgiveness for it in this world or in the next\.

You should avoid shedding blood without justification because nothing invites the Divine retribution or is greater in \(evil\) consequences and more effective in the decline of prosperity and cutting short of life more than the shedding of blood without a justification\. On the Day of Judgement, Allah, the Glorified One, will commence giving His judgement among the people with regard to the cases of bloodshed

<a id="page829"></a>committed by them\. Do not, therefore, strengthen your authority by shedding prohibited blood because this will weaken and lower authority\. It moreover destroys it and shifts it elsewhere\. You cannot offer any excuse before Allah or before me for any wilful killing because there must be the question of revenge in it\. If you are involved in it be error and you exceed in the use of your whip or sword or are harsh in inflicting punishment, as sometimes even a blow by the fist or a smaller stroke causes death, then the pride in your authority should not prevent you from paying the blood money to the survivors of the killed person\.

You should avoid self \-admiration\. Rely in what appears to be good on yourself\. Do not have any affinity for any exaggerated praise; it is one of the most reliable opportunities for Satan to obliterate the good deeds of the virtuous\.

Avoid demonstrating \(the weight of\) your obligation to your subjects for having done good to them or praising your own actions or making promises then breaking them\. Demonstrating such an obligation destroys goodness\. Self\-praise takes away the light of truth\. Breaking promises earns the hatred of Allah and of the people\. Allah, the Glorified One, says the following: “Most hateful to Allah is that you say what you do not do” \(Holy Quran, 61: 3\)\.

Avoid haste in matters before their time\. Slowness till their proper time, insistence on them when the propriety of action is not known or weakens when it becomes clear is preferable\. Assign to every matter its proper place and do every job at its appropriate time\.

Do not appropriate to yourself that in which the people have an equal share, nor should you be indifferent of matters which have come to light with the excuse that you are accountable for others\. Shortly, the curtains of all matters will be raised from your vision and you will be required to render redress to the oppressed\. Have control over \(your\) sense of prestige\. Beware of any outburst of anger, the might of your arm and the sharpness of your tongue\. Guard yourself against all these by avoiding haste and by delaying severe measures till your anger subsides and till you gain your self\- control\. You cannot withhold yourself from this unless you bear in mind that you have to return to Allah\.

It is necessary for you to recall how matters went with those who preceded you, be it those of a government, or a great tradition, or a precedent of our Prophet \(h\), or the obligatory commands contained in

<a id="page830"></a>the Book of Allah\. You should follow them as you have seen us acting upon them and should exert yourself in following what I have enjoined you to follow in this document wherein I have exhausted my pleas to you\. If your heart advances towards its passions, you may have no plea in its support\.

I ask Allah through the extent of His mercy and the greatness of His power of giving to grant me a good inclination, that He may prompt me and you own selves to present a clear plea before Him and before His creatures in a manner that may attract His pleasure along with handsome praise among the people, good effect in the country, an increase in prosperity and a heightening of honor, and that He may allow me and you own selves to die a death of virtue and martyrdom\. Surely, we have to return to Him\. Peace be on the Messenger of Allah \(k\), and that is the

end of the matter\.

This document, which deserves to be called the constitution of the Islamic policy, was prepared by the person who was the greatest scholar of the Divine Law and who acted upon it more than anyone else\. From studying Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s way of governance as recorded on these pages, it can be concluded that his aim was only to enforce the Divine Law and the improvement of social conditions , not to disrupt public security or to fill treasures by plunder, or to strive to extend the country’s boundaries by fair or foul means\. Worldly governments generally adopt such constitutions which cater to their utmost benefit and try to change every law which is against that aim or jeopardizes their objective\. Every article of this constitution serves as a custodian of common interests and protects collective organization\. Its enforcement has no impact over selfishness; there is no iota of self\-interest in it\. It contains such basic principles for the fulfillment of Allah’s obligations, the protection of human rights without distinction of religion or community, care for the destitute, the poor, the provision of succor to the low and the down\-trodden\. From it, full guidance can be earned for the propagation of righteousness and justice, the establishment of peace and security, and the prosperity and well\-being of the people\.

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) wrote this instrument for Malik ibn

al\-Harith al\-Ashtar when the latter was appointed as the Governor of Egypt in 38 A\.H\./658 A\.D\. Malik al\-Ashtar was one of the chief companions of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\. He had shown great endurance, steadfastness, perfect confidence and trust in Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\. He had attained the utmost nearness and attachment to him by molding his conduct and character after those of Imam Ali ibn Abu

<a id="page831"></a>Talib \(x\)\. This can be gauged by Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s words:

“Malik was to me as I was to the Messenger of Allah \(k\)” \(Ibn Abul\-

Hadid, Vol\. 15, p\. 98; Al \-A\`lam, Vol\. 6, p\. 131\)\. Malik al\-Ashtar, too, proved all of this through his selfless attitude towards his service, took a very active part in military encounters and proved himself to be Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s right arm in all battles and encounters\. He showed such feats of courage and daring that his bravery was acknowledged throughout Arabia\. Along with this bravery he was also conspicuous in endurance and forbearing\. In this regard, Warram ibn Abu Firas an\-Nakh\`i has written that once Malik was passing through the market of Kufa wearing an outfit and turban made of gunny\-cloth when a shopkeeper, finding him in this condition and wearing such clothes, threw some rotten leaves on him, but he did not at all mind this dirty behavior, nor did he even look at him\. Rather, he quietly stepped forward\. Then someone said to that shopkeeper, “Do you know to whom you have been so insolent?” He replied that he did not know who he was, whereupon he was told that it was Malik al\-Ashtar, companion of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\. Hearing this, the shopkeeper almost lost his wits and at once

ran behind Malik him to ask for his forgiveness for this insolence and humiliating treatment\. In his search, he reached a mosque where Malik was offering prayers\. When he finished the prayers, this man went forward and fell on Malik’s feet and begged for his pardon with great pertinacity and weeping\. Malik raised the man’s chin up and said, “By Allah, I have come to the mosque to pray to Allah to forgive you\. I myself had pardoned you that very moment and I hope Allah, too, will pardon you” \(Tanbihul\-Khawatir wa Nuzhatul\- Nawazir, Vol\. 1, p\. 2; Bihar al\-Anwar, Vol\. 42, p\. 157\)\. Such is the forgiveness and tolerance of a warrior at the mention of whose name courage itself trembled and whose swordsmanship was acknowledged by the brave men of Arabia\. And such is the real sign of bravery: A man should exercise self\-control during the bitterness of anger and moment of outrage and endure hardships with patience and calmness\. In this regard, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s saying is that, “The most brave of men is one who over\-powers his own passions\.”

However, besides these characteristics and qualities, he had a perfect aptitude for organization and administration\. Thus, when the Othmani \(al\-Othmaniyyah\) party began to spread the germs of destruction in Egypt and tried to upset the law and order of the country by mischief and rebellion, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) removed Muhammad ibn Abu

Bakr from his post as the Governor of the country and decided to appoint Malik al\-Ashtar in his place, although at that time Malik was also posted as the Governor of Nasibin\. However, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) sent

<a id="page832"></a>him word that he should name someone as his deputy and come to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\. Upon receipt of this order, Malik al\-Ashtar appointed Shabib ibn Amir al\-Azdi in his place and he himself went to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) gave him his

written appointment and sent him off to Egypt and also sent a separate written order to the Egyptians to obey him\. When Mu\`awiyah got the news of Malik al\-Ashtar’s appointment through his spies, he was upset because he had promised Amr ibn al\-As that he would make him the governor of Egypt in reward for his services\. He had hoped that Amr ibn al\-As would easily defeat Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr and wrest the power from him, but he now could not imagine conquering Egypt by defeating Malik al\-Ashtar\. He, therefore, decided to do away with him before he took over the charge\. For this, he arranged with a landlord of the city of al\-Arish \(or al\-Qulzumm\) that when Malik passed through Al\-Arish on his way to Egypt, he should kill him by some device or other and in reward for this the tax revenue of his estate would be written off\. So, when Malik al\-Ashtar reached al\-Arish with retinue and force, the chief of al\-Arish stood up in respect for him and insisted on having Malik as his own guest\. Malik agreed and stayed at his place\. When he finished the meal, the host gave him some syrup of honey to drink in which he had added some poison\. Soon after drinking it, the poison began to show its effect and before the eyes of everyone, this great warrior known for his swordsmanship and for putting the rows of the enemy to fight calmly surrendered to death\.

When Mu\`awiyah received the news of the success of this plot, he was overjoyed and shouted in merriment, “O, honey is also an army of Allah\!” Then, in a speech, he said, “Ali ibn Abu Talib had two right hand men\. One was chopped off on the day of Siffin: that was Ammar ibn Yasir, and the second has been severed now: he is Malik al\-Ashtar\.”

When the news of Malik’s assassination reached Imam Ali ibn

Abu Talib \(x\), he was very grieved and sorrowful\. He said the following:

“Malik\! Who is Malik?\! If Malik was a stone, he was hard and solid; if he was a rock, he was a great rock which had no parallel\. It seems his death has made me also lifeless\. I swear by Allah that his death made the Syrians joyous and insulted the Iraqis\.” Then he continued to say: “Women have become too barren to give birth to a man like Malik\.\.\.” \(al\-Tabari, Vol\. 1, pp\. 3392\-3395; Ibn al \-Athir, Vol\. 3, pp\. 352\-353; al\-Ya\`qubi, Vol\. 2, p\. 194; Al\-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 3, p\. 1366; Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 6, pp\. 74\-77; Ibn Kathir, Vol\. 7, pp\. 313\-314; Abul\-Fida’, Vol\. 1, p\. 179\)\.

<a id="page833"></a>**Letter 54**

**To Talhah and az\-Zubayr \(through Imran ibn al\-Hussain al\-Khuza’i1\)\. AbÅ Ja\`far al\-Iskafi has mentioned this in his “Kitab al\-Maqamat on the excellent qualities \(manaqib\) of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)**\.”

You both know, though you conceal it, that I did not approach the people before they approached me, and I did not ask them to swear the oath of allegiance to me till they themselves swore the oath of allegiance to me\. You both were among those who approached me and swore the oath of allegiance to me\. Certainly the common people did not swear the oath of allegiance under any force or for any money given to them\. If you two swore allegiance to me obediently, come back and offer repentance to Allah soon\. But if you swore allegiance to me reluctantly, you have certainly given me cause for action by showing your obedience and

214Imra n ibn al\-Hussain al\-Khuza’i was a high ranking companion \[of Imam Ali \(x\)\] who was distinguished for his learning and achievements\. He was very cautious in relating traditions\. He accepted Islam in the year of the Battle of Khaybar and participated in _jihad_ with the Prophet \(h\)\. He was honored by the judicial status in Kufa and died in Basra in 52 A\.H\. One of the authentic traditions related by Imra n ibn al\-Hussain about Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) is this: The Messenger of Allah raised and sent an army under the command of Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\. From the _khums_ \(one\-fifth\) received by him, “Ali set aside a slave girl for himself\. This was seen as distasteful by some of his men and four of them decided to complain of it to the Prophet \(h\)\. On their return, they approached the Prophet \(h\) and one of them stood up and said the following: O Messenger of Allah\! Do you not see that Ali \(x\) did such\-and\-such?’ The Prophet \(h\) turned his face away from him\. Another man stood up and made the same complaint and the Prophet \(h\) turned his face away from him, too\.

Still another man stood up and repeated what his two colleagues had said and met the same reaction\. Then the fourth man stood up and spoke like his predecessors\. The Prophet \(h\) finally turned to them with signs of anger on his

face and said the following: \`What do you want me to do to Ali? \(repeating it thrice\)\. Surely Ali is from me and I am from him and after me he is the master of all the believers’” \(_Jami’al\-Sihah_, al\-Tirmidhi, Vol\. 5, p\. 632; _Al\-Musnad_, Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Vol\. 4, pp\. 437\-438; _Al\-Musnad_, Abu Dawud at\-Tayalisi, p\. 111; _Al\-Mustadrak_ , al\-Hakim, Vol\. 3, pp\. 110\-111; _Hilyat al\-Awliya’_, Abu Nu’aym, Vol\. 6, p\. 294; _Tarikh al\-Islam_, al\-Dhahbi, Vol\. 2, p\. 196; _Tarikh_, Ibn Kathir, Vol\. 7, p\. 345; _Usd al\-Ghaba_, Ibn al\-Athir, Vol\. 4, p\. 27, _Al\-Isaba_, Ibn Hajar, Vol\. 2, p\. 509\)\.

<a id="page834"></a>concealing your disobedience215 By my life, you were not more entitled than other Muhajirun to conceal and hide the matter\. Your refusal to swear the oath of allegiance before actually doing so would have been easier than getting out of it after having already accepted it\.

You have indicated that I killed Othman; then let someone from among the people of Medina who supported neither me nor you decide the matter between me and yourself\. One of us shall face\(the command of law\) according to \(one’s\) involvement\. You should give up your way now, when the great question before you is only one of shame, before you face the question of shame coupled with the fire of Hell, and that is the end of the matter\.

**Letter 55**

**To Mu\`awiyah**

Allah, the Glorified One, has made this world for what is to come, for the Hereafter, putting its inhabitants to trial as to which of you is good in deeds\. We have not been created for this world, nor ordered to strive for it\. We have been made to stay in it to stand the trial therein\. So, Allah has tried me by you and tried you by me\. He has, therefore, made each of us a plea for the other\.

Now, you have leapt on the world by a wrong interpretation of the Holy Quran and wanted me to account for what neither my hand nor tongue was responsible, yet you and the Syrians put the blame on me and your scholar incited against me the ignorant and one who is sitting incited the one who is standing\. You should fear Allah with regard to your soul and not allow Satan to lead you\. Turn your face towards the next world because that is our path and yours\. Fear lest Allah should entangle you in any sudden affliction which may destroy the root as well as cut away the branches\. I swear to you by Allah an oath which will not be broken that if destiny brings me and you together, I shall steadfastly hold before you:

215That is to say, “You are men of riches and means, having a large tribe and community\. Why do you need this double dealing of concealing the real feelings of the heart, showing obedience and swearing allegiance loathsomely and unwillingly? Of course, if someone else who is weak and helpless said that he was obliged to swear the oath of allegiance, his point could be accepted to some extent\. But when no one else has expressed his helplessness in the matter, why did this helplessness befall you so that you now regard your swearing of allegiance to be the result of your helplessness?\!”

<a id="page835"></a>“Till Allah judges between us and He is the Best of the judges” \(Holy Quran, 7: 87\)\.

**Instruction 56**

**When Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Placed Shurayh Ibn Hani**

**\(al\- Madhhaji\) at the Head of the Vanguard Preceding Towards Syria, He Issued this Document of Instruction to Him**\.

Fear Allah every morning and evening and remain apprehensive about yourself with regard to this deceitful world, and do not regard it as safe in any case\. Be informed that if, for fear of some evil, you do not refrain from things which you love, passions will then fling you into a lot of harm\. Therefore, refrain for your own soul and be your own protector against your anger; suppress and kill it\.

**Letter 57**

**To the People of Kufa When He Marched from Medina to**

**Basra**

I have come out of my city either as an oppressor or as an oppressed person, either as a rebel or as the one against whom rebellion has been committed\. In any case, whomsoever this letter of mine reaches, I appeal to him in the name of Allah that he should come to me, and if I am in the right, he should help me; but if I am wrong, then he should try to get me to the right according to his view\.

**Letter 58**

**Written to the People of Various Localities Describing What Took Place Between Him and the People of Siffin**

It all began thus: We and the Syrians met in an encounter although we believe in one and the same God and follow the same Prophet \(h\) and our message in Islam is the same\. We did not want them to add anything to the belief in Allah or to acknowledging His Messenger \(k\), nor did they want us to add any such things\. In fact, there was a

complete unity except that we differed on the question of shedding Othman’s blood although we were not involved in it\. We suggested to them to appease the situation by calming the temporary irritation and

<a id="page836"></a>pacifying the people till matters settled down and stabilized when we would gain strength to put matters right\.

They, however, said that they would settle it by war\. Thus, they refused our offer and consequently war spread its wings and came to stay\. Its flames rose and gained momentum\. Once the war had bitten us as well as them and pierced its talons into us as well as into them, they accepted what we had proposed to them\. So, we agreed to what they suggested and hastened to meet their request\. In this way, the plea became clear to them and no excuse was left to them\. Now, whoever among them adheres to this will be saved by Allah from ruin, and whoever shows obstinacy and insistence \(on wrong\) is the opposite: one whose heart has been blinded by Allah and evils will surround his head\.

**Letter 59**

**To al\-Aswad ibn Qutbah, Governor of Hulwan**

If the actions of a governor follow the passions, his justice will be greatly hampered\. All people should be equal in their rights before you because injustice cannot substitute justice\. Avoid that thing the like of which you will not like for your own self\. Exert yourself in what Allah has made obligatory on you, hoping for His reward and fearing His chastisement\.

Be informed that this world is a place of trial\. Whoever here wastes any hour of his time will repent it on the Day of Judgement and nothing can ever make you too satisfied as not to need righteousness\. One of your obligations is that you should protect yourself \(from sins\) and look after the subjects your best\. The benefit that will come to you from this will be greater than that which will accrue \(to people\) through you, and that is the end of the matter\.

**Letter 60**

**To the Officers Through Whose Jurisdictions the Army**

**Passes**

From the servant of Allah, Ali ibn Abu Talib, to all the collectors of revenue and officers of the realm through whose area the army passes\.

I have sent an army that will pass by you, if Allah so wills\. I have instructed them about what Allah has made obligatory on them, namely

<a id="page837"></a>that they should avoid assault and shun harm\. I hold myself clear before you and those \(unbelievers\) who are under your protection from any annoyance committed by the army except when one is compelled by hunger and there is no other way to satisfy it\. If anyone of them takes anything by force, you should punish him\. None of you should be foolish enough to obstruct them or intervene in matters which we have allowed them by way of exception\. I myself am within the army\. So, refer to me their high\- handedness and any hardship which is caused by them and which you cannot avert except through Allah and through myself\. I shall then avert it with the help of Allah, if He so wills\.

**Letter 61**

**To Kumayl ibn Ziyad an\-Nakh\`i, Governor of Hit, Expressing Displeasure with His Inability to Prevent the Enemy Forces That Passed Through His Area from Marauding**

The negligence by a man of what he has been made responsible for, and the doing of what is to be done by others, is a manifest weakness and a ruinous sight\. Certainly, your advance on the people of Qarqisiya and your abandonment of the forces over which we had appointed you, without anyone to protect them or to repulse the enemy force, are signs of a shattered mentality\. In this way, you served like a bridge for the enemy who came marauding on your allies while your arms were weak\. You had no force around you\. You could not prevent the enemy from advancing\. You could not break its might\. You could not defend the people of your area and you could not carry out functions on behalf of your Imam\.

**Letter 62**

**To the People of Egypt Sent Through Malik al\-Ashtar When He Was Made Governor**

Allah, the Glorified One, deputed Muhammad \(h\) as a warner for all the worlds and a witness for all the prophets\. When the Prophet \(h\) expired, the Muslims quarrelled about power after him\. By Allah, it never occurred to me and I never imagined that after the Prophet \(h\) the Arabs would snatch away the caliphate from his Ahlul\-Bayt \(x\), nor that

<a id="page838"></a>they would take it away from me after him, but I suddenly noticed how people surrounded the man to swear the oath of allegiance to him\.216

I, therefore, withheld my hand till I saw that many people were reverting from Islam and trying to destroy the religion of Muhammad \(h\)\. I then feared that if I did not protect Islam and its people, and if

there occurred in it a breach or destruction, it would mean a greater blow to me than the loss of power over you which was, in any case, to last for a few days of which everything would pass away as the mirage passes away, or as the cloud scuds away\. Therefore, in these eventualities, I rose till wrong was destroyed and disappeared and religion attained peace and safety\.

216The Prophet’s declarations about Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) such

as: “This is my brother, my vicegerent and my caliph among you,” and while returning from his farewell hajj at Ghadir Khum, that “For whosoever I am the master, Ali is his master” had already settled the issue of the Prophet’s replacement and succession\. Besides them, there was no further need at all for any new “election”, nor could it be imagined that the people of Medna would feel the need for an “election” after Allah had already elected a man to succeed His Prophet \(k\)\. But some power\-hungry individuals ignored these clear

injunctions as if their ears had never been acquainted with them and considered the election so necessary that, forgetting completely about performing the burial rites for the Prophet \(h\), they assembled at the _saqifa_ of Banu Sa\`idah and “elected” Abu Bakr as caliph without the slightest show of a democratic process\. This was a very critical moment for Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\. On one hand,

some interested individuals declared that he should take up arms and, on the other hand, he noticed that those Arabs who had accepted Islam by dint of its military might were leaving it and Musaylimah ibn Thumamah al\-Hanafi, the Liar \(al\- Kaththab\), and Tulayhah ibn Khuwaylid al\-Asadi \(the Liar\) were throwing tribe after tribe into misguidance\. In these circumstances, had there been a civil war and Muslims had fought against Muslims, the forces of heresy and hypocrisy would have joined together and swept Islam off the surface of the earth\. Therefore, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) preferred to keep quiet rather than

to fight and, with the purpose of maintaining the solidarity of Islam, confined himself to peacefully protesting rather than taking up arms\. This was because formal power was not so dear to him as the good and prosperity of the community\. For stopping the machinations of the hypocrites and defeating the aims of the mischief mongers, there was no other course but that he should not fan the flames of war by giving up his own claim\. This was such a big deed for the preservation of Islamic policy that it is acknowledged by all the sects of Islam\.

<a id="page839"></a>**An excerpt from the same letter:**

By Allah, if I had encountered them alone and they had been so numerous as to fill earth to the brim, I will not have worried or become perplexed\. I am clear in myself and possess conviction from Allah about their misguidance and my guidance\. I am hopeful and expectant that I will meet Allah and get His good reward\. But I am worried that foolish and wicked people will control the affairs of the entire community\. The result: They will grab the funds of Allah as their own property and make His people slaves,217 fight with the virtuous and ally with the sinful\. Indeed, there is among them whoever drank \(wine\) unlawfully218 and was

2172\. This refers to the saying of the Holy Prophet \(h\) about the

children of Umayyah and the children of Abul\-As ibn Umayyah \(grandfather of Othman ibn Affan and ancestor of the dynasty of Marwan’s caliphs\), as related by Abu Dharr al\-Ghifari, that the Holy Prophet \(h\) said the following: “When

the number of Banu Umayyah reaches forty men, they will make Allah’s people their slaves, grab Allah’s funds as their own property and render the Book of Allah a cause of corruption” \(_Al\-Mustadrak_, Vol\. 4, p\. 479; _Kanz al\-Ummal_, Vol\. 11, p\. 149\)\. About the children of Abul\-As it is related by Abu Dharr, Abu Sa’id al\-Khudri, Ibn Abbas, Abu Hurayra and others that the Holy Prophet \(h\)

said the following: “When the number of Banu Abul\-As reaches thirty men, they will grab the funds of Allah as their own property, make Allah’s people their slaves and render the religion of Allah a cause of corruption” \(_Al\-Musnad_, Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Vol\. 3, p\. 80; _Al\-Mustadrak_, al\-Hakim, Vol\. 4, p\. 480; _Al\-Matalib al\-Aliyah_, Ibn Hajar, Vol\. 4, p\. 332;_ Majma’az\-Zawa’id_, al\-Haythami,\* *Vol\. 5, pp\. 241, 243; *Kanz al\-Ummal\*, al\-Muttaqi al\-Hindi, Vol\. 11, pp\. 148, 149, 351, 354\)\. The history of Islam \(after the death of the Holy Prophet \[h\]\)

contains sufficient testimony to prove this prediction of the Holy Prophet \(h\)\. The fear of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) for the Muslim community was based

on it\.

2183\. The man who drank wine was al\-Walid ibn Uqbah ibn Abu Mu’ayt\. He was born by the same mother as that of caliph Othman and of his Governor of Kufa\. Al\-Walid, on an occasion, in a state of intoxication, led the morning prayers in the central mosque of Kufa with four _raka’at_ instead of the usual two as prescribed by the Holy Prophet \(h\)\. The congregation, which

consisted of several pious persons like ibn Mas\`Åd, was outraged and felt further irritated when, finishing the four _raka’at_, al\-Walid said the following: “What a pleasant morning?\! I would like to extend the prayers\. Furthermore, if you consent, repeated complaints had already been made to the caliph against al\-Walid on account of his debauchery, but as often dismissed\.” People now reproached Othman for not listening to their grievances and favoring such a scoundrel\. By chance, they succeeded in taking off the signet ring from the hand of the Governor as he lay unconscious from the effects of an act of his

<a id="page840"></a>whipped by way of punishment fixed by Islam and there is whoever did not accept Islam till he had secured financial gain through it\.219 If this had not been so, I would not have emphasized gathering you, reprimanding you, mobilizing you and urging you \(for jihad\), but if you refuse and show weakness, I will leave you\.

Do you not see that the boundaries of your cities have diminished, your populated areas have been conquered, your possessions have been snatched away and your cities and lands have been assaulted? May Allah have mercy on you, get up to fight your enemy and do not remain confined to the ground; otherwise, you will face oppression and suffer ignominy and your fate will be the worst\. The warrior should be wakeful because if he sleeps, the enemy does not sleep, and that is the end of the matter\.

**Letter 63**

**To Abu Musa \(\`Abdullah ibn Qays\) al\-Ash\`ari, Governor of Kufa when Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) learned that he was dissuading the people of Kufa from joining the forces to fight the battle of Jamal when Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had called them to fight along with him**:

From the servant of Allah, Ali ibn Abu Talib, to \`Abdullah ibn Qays: I have come to know of words uttered by you which go in your favor as well as against you220\. So, when my messenger reaches you,

debauchery\. It was carried off to Medina\. Still, the caliph was too slow and hesitated to enforce the punishment on his Governor \(his half brother\); giving cause to be himself reproachfully accused of ignoring the law, although at last he was persuaded to have al\-Walid whipped forty lashes\. He was consequently deposed from his office\. Sa’id ibn al\-As, a cousin of Othman was appointed to take his place, and this was a matter of a great reproach against Othman” \(_Ansab_ _al\-Ashraf_, al\-Baladhiri, Vol\. 5, pp\. 33\-35;_ Al\-Aghani_, Abul\-Faraj al\-Isfahani,\* *Vol\. 4, pp\. 174\-187; *Al\-Isti\`ab*, Vol\. 4, pp\. 1554\-1557; *Usd al\-Ghaba\*, Vol\. 5,

1. 91\-92; al\-Tabari, Vol\. 1, pp\. 2843\-2850; Ibn al\-Athir, Vol\. 3, pp\. 105\-107; Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 17, pp\. 227\-245\)\.

219The man who accepted Islam only after securing financial gain was Mu\`awiyah who did so only for worldly benefits*\.*

2201\. When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had the idea of suppressing the rebellion of the people of Basra, he sent this letter through Imam al\-Hassan \(x\) to Abu Musa \(Abdullah ibn Qays\) al\-Ash\`ari, who had been appointed Governor of Kufa by Othman\. In it, the Imam \(x\) scolds him for his duplicity and self\-

<a id="page841"></a>prepare yourself and get ready, come out of your den and call upon those who are with you\. Then, if you are convinced of the truth, get up\. But if you feel cowardly, go away\. By Allah, you will be caught wherever you may be and you will not be spared till you are completely upset and everything about you is scattered and till you are shaken from your seat\. Then, you will fear from your front as you do from the rear\.

What you hope for is not a light matter; it is a serious calamity\. We have to ride its camels, overcome its difficulties and level its mountains\. Set your mind in order, take a grip on your affairs and acquire your \(lot and your\) share\. If you do not like it, go away to where neither you are welcome nor can you escape\. It is better that you be left alone and lie sleeping\. Then no one will inquire where is so\-and\-so\. By Allah, this is the case of right with the rightful person, and we do not care what the heretics do, and that is the end of the matter\.

**Letter 64**

**Replying to Mu\`awiyah**\.

Certainly, we and you were on amicable terms, as you mentioned, but differences arose between us and your own self the other day when we accepted belief \(iman\)while you rejected it\. Today, the status is that we are steadfast \(in our belief\) but you are creating mischief\. Those of you who accepted Islam did so reluctantly and that, too, took place when all the chief men had accepted Islam and joined the Messenger of Allah \(may Allah bless him and his descendants\)\.

contradictory behavior\. He also attempted to persuade him to carry out _jihad_ because on one hand, he used to say that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) was the

true Imam and allegiance to him was right while, on the other, he said that to support him in fighting against the Muslims was not right, that it was a mischief and it was necessary to keep off this mischief\. Thus, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

has referred to this contradictory view with the words “huwa laka wa’alayka” \(which go in your favor as well as against you\)\. The intention is that when Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) is the rightful Imam, how can fighting his enemy in his

own company be wrong? And if fighting on his side is wrong, then what is the meaning of saying that he is the rightful Imam? In any case, in spite of his reluctance to fight, the people of Kufa came out in large numbers to join Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s army and fully participated in the battle, giving such a defeat to the people of Basra that the latter never again dared to rebellion thereafter*\.*

<a id="page842"></a>You have stated that I killed Talhah and az\- Zubayr, forced Aisha out of her house and adopted residence between the two cities \(Kufa and Basra\)\. These matters are none of your concern, nor do they involve anything against you\. Therefore, no explanation about them is due to you\.

You also state that you are coming to me with a party of Muhajirun and Ansar, but hijra came to an end on the day your brother was taken prisoner\. If you are in a hurry, then wait a bit as I may come to meet you and that will be more befitting as it will mean that Allah has appointed me to punish you\. But if you come to me, it will be just as the poet of Banu Asad said: “They are advancing against summer winds which are hurling stones on them in the highlands and in the lowlands\.”

\(Remember that\) I still have the sword with which I dispatched your grandfather, mother’s brother and brother to one and the same place \(Hell\)\. By Allah, I know what you are\! Your heart is sheathed and your intelligence is weak\. It is better to say that you have ascended to where you view a bad scene which is against you, not in your favor, because you are searching a thing lost by someone else, you are tending someone else’s cattle and you are hankering after a thing which is not yours nor have you any attachment to it\. How remote your words are from your actions, and how closely you resemble your paternal and maternal uncles who were led by their wickedness and love for wrong to oppose Muhammad \(h\), consequently, they were killed as you know\. They

could not put up a defense against the calamity and could not protect their “safe haven” from the striking of swords which abound in the battle and which do not show weakness\.

You have said a lot about the killing of Othman\. You must first join what the people have joined \(i\.e\. allegiance\) then seek a verdict about \(the accused people\) from me and I shall settle the matter between you and them according to the Book of Allah, the Sublime\. But what you are aiming at is just the fake nipple given to a child in the first days of weaning\. Peace be on those who deserve it\.

Mu\`awiyah had written a letter to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) in

which he, having recalled mutual unity and amicability, laid on him the blame of killing Talhah and az\-Zubayr and getting Aisha out of her house with the objective to adopt Kufa as his seat of government in place of Medina\. In the end, he made a threat of war, saying that he was about to come out with a force of Muhajirun and Ansar to fight\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) wrote this letter in reply to him wherein he commented about

<a id="page843"></a>Mu\`awiyah’s claim for unity\. He meant to say the following: “There might have been unity between you and us, but with the advent of Islam, such a huge gap has developed between both of us that it is not possible to bridge it and such a separation has occurred which cannot be rejoined\. The reason for all of this is that we responded to the call of the Prophet \(h\) and hastened towards Islam while you were still an unbeliever and

living in ignorance, hence, we and you came to adopt separate ways\. But when Islam secured stability and the chief of Arabs entered its fold, you, too, felt obliged to do so \[with the threat of otherwise losing your life\]\. You secured protection of your lives by pretending to accept Islam, but you continued secretly to fan the mischief intended to shatter Islam’s foundations\. Since we had accepted Islam of our own free will and pleasure, we adhered to the right path\. At no stage did any faltering occur in our steadfastness\. Therefore, your acceptance of Islam could not make us agree with your views\.”

As regarding Mu\`awiyah’s accusation that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) engineered the killing of Talhah and az\-Zubayr, even if this blame is admitted as true, is it not a fact that they had both openly revolted against Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and had risen for war after

breaking their oath of allegiance to him? Therefore, if they were killed with regard to their rebellion, their blood would be wasted, and no blame would lie on the killer because the penalty for whoever rebellions against the rightful Imam is death and fighting against him is permissible, without any doubt\. The fact, however, is that this accusation is baseless because Talhah was killed by a man from his own party\. Thus, the historians write: Marwan ibn al\-Hakam shot Talhah with an arrow and, turning to Aban ibn Othman, said the following: “We have killed a killer of your father and relieved you of revenge” \(Ibn Sa\`d, Vol\. 3, part 1, p\. 159; Ibn Al\-Athir Vol\. 3, p\. 244; Al \-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 2, pp\. 766\-769; Usd al\-Ghaba, Vol\. 3, pp\. 60, 61; Al\-Isaba, Vol\. 2, p\. 230; Tahthib al\-Tahthib, Vol\. 5, p\. 21\)\.

As for az\-Zubayr, he was killed by Amr ibn Jurmuz as he was on his way back from Basra and there was no hand of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) in it\. Similarly, Aisha herself came out of her house as the head

of this rebellious group while Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) advised her

several times to realize her status and not to step out of her bounds, but these suggestions had no effect on her\.

<a id="page844"></a>Of the same note was his criticism that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) left Medina and adopted Kufa as the seat of his government because

Medina turned out bad people and threw away dirt\. The reply to this is only that Mu\`awiyah himself always retained Damascus as his capital, always staying away from Medina\.

In this way, what right can he have to object to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) changing his seat of government? Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

left Medina because of those rebellions which had cropped up from all directions\. In order to suppress them, only the selection of such a place as a capital, from where military assistance could be mobilized at any time, could be useful\. Thus, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had seen on the

occasion of the Battle of Jamal that a great majority of the people of Kufa had supported him\. By making it a base for the army, the defense of the Imam \(x\) against the enemy could be easily managed, while Medina was not appropriate for military mobilization, supplies or reinforcements\.

Finally, as for Mu\`awiyah’s threat that he will march with the Muhajirun and the Ansar, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) replied to this point

in a very subtle way: “How will you bring the Muhajirun now since the door for hijra was closed when your brother, Yazid ibn Abu Sufyan, was taken prisoner?” This man was taken prisoner on the day of the fall of Mecca\. There is no question of hijra after the fall of Mecca so as to enable anyone to be called a muhajir because of the Prophet’s saying: “There is no hijra after the victory over Mecca\.”

**Letter 65**

**To Mu\`awiyah**

Now is the time221 that you should benefit by observing a clear view of the main matters because you have been treading in the path of

221At the end of the battle of the Kharijites, Mu\`awiyah wrote a letter to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) wherein he, as usual, indulged in mud\-slinging\. In

reply, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) wrote this letter in which he has tried to draw

Mu\`awiyah’s attention to the clear facts about this very battle of the Kharijites because this battle took place in accordance with the prediction of the Prophet \(h\) while Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) himself had said before the battle that

besides the people of Jamal and Siffin, he had to fight against one more group and they were the “deviators” from the religion, namely the Kharijites\. The

<a id="page845"></a>your forefathers of making wrong claims, spreading false and untrue notions, claiming for yourself what is far above you and demanding what is not meant for you: You want to run away from what is right and to rebellion against what is more fastened to your flesh and blood, namely what has been heard by the depth of your ears and has filled your chest\. After forsaking right, nothing remains except clear misguidance, and after disregarding a \(clear\) statement, there is nothing left but confusion\. You should, therefore, guard \(yourself\) against doubts and the ill\-effects of confusion because for a long time, mischief has spread its veils and its gloom has blinded your eyes\.

I have received your letter which is full of uncouth utterances: They weaken the cause of peace\. It also is full of nonsensical expressions which have not been prepared with knowledge and forbearance\. By reason of these things, you have become like one who is sinking in a marshy land or groping in a dark place\. You have raised yourself to a status which is difficult to approach and is devoid of any signs \(of guidance\)\. Even the royal kite cannot reach it\. It is parallel to the Ayyuq \(the star Capella\), in loftiness\.

May Allah forbid that you should be in charge of people’s affairs after my assuming authority as caliph, or that I should issue an edict or document granting you authority over any of them\. Therefore, from now on, you should guard yourself and be watchful because if you recalcitrate till the people of Allah \(are forced to\) rush upon you, then matters will be

occurrence of this battle and the killing of the man with breasts \(Dhul\-Thudayya\) was a clear proof of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) being on the right

track\. If Mu\`awiyah had not been obsessed with self\-praise and lust for conquests, and had he not shut his eyes against what is right, as was the case with his forefather, Abun Sufyan, and his brother, Utbah, he would have seen right and joined its tracks\. But compelled by his natural inclinations, he always evaded what is right and shunned the truth, keeping himself blind to those sayings of the Prophet \(h\) which threw light on Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s

Imamate and vicegerency\. Because of being with the Prophet \(h\) in the

farewell pilgrimage, the Prophet’s saying: “Of whomsoever I am the master, Ali is his master” was not hidden from him\. Neither was the Prophet’s saying that: “O Ali\! You are to me as Harun was to Musa” because of his presence during the battle of Tabuk\. In spite of all this, Mu\`awiyah spent all his life concealing right and encouraging wrong\. This was not due to any misunderstanding; rather, it was his own lust for power\. This is what kept him busy prompting himself through means of suppression, trampling on the truth and violating justice, and thus do some people behave\.

**To Abdullah ibn Abbas**

**\(A different version of this letter has already been included\)**

Sometimes a person feels joyful about a thing which he was not to miss in any case and feels grieved for a thing which was not to come to him at all\. You, therefore, should not regard the attainment of pleasure and the satisfaction of the desire for revenge as the best favor in this world; rather, the putting off of the \(flame of\) wrong and the revival of right should be so\. Your pleasure should be for what \(good deeds\) you have sent forward; our grief for having lost you should be for what you are leaving behind, and your worry should be about what is to befall after death\.

**Letter 67**

**To Qutham ibn al\-Abbas, his Governor over Mecca**

Make arrangements for people’s hajj\. Remind them of the days \(of devotion to\) Allah\. Give them audience in the morning and in the evening\. Explain the law to the seeker, teach the ignorant and hold discussions with the learned\. There should be no intermediary between you and the people except your tongue and no guard save your own face\. Do not prevent any needy person from meeting you because if the needy is returned unsatisfied from your door in the first instance, even doing it thereafter will not bring you praise\.

See what has been levied with you of the funds of Allah \(in the public treasury\) and spend it over the persons who have families, the distressed, the starving, the naked, at your end\. Then send the remainder to us for distribution to those at this end\.

Ask the people of Mecca not to charge rent from lodgers because Allah, the Glorified One, says the following: “\.\.\. alike for the dweller therein as well as the stranger” \(Holy Quran, 22: 25\)\. “Al\-Aakif” \(the mosque dweller\) here means whoever is living there, while “al\- badi” \(the stranger\) means whoever is not among the people of Mecca, one who

<a id="page847"></a>comes for hajj from outside\. May Allah grant us and yourself promptitude for seeking His love \(by doing good deeds\), and that is the end of the matter\.

**Letter 68**

**To Salman al\-Farisi Prior to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s Caliphate**:

The example of the world is like that of a snake which is soft in touch but whose poison is fatal\. Therefore, keep yourself aloof from whatever appears to be good to you because of its short stay with you\. Do not worry about it because of your conviction that it will leave you and that its circumstances are vicissitudes\. When you feel most attracted to it, shun it the most because whenever someone is assured of happiness in it, it throws him into danger, or when he feels secure in it, the world alters his security into fear, and that is the end of the matter\.

**Letter 69**

**To al\-Harith \(ibn Abdillah, al\-A\`war\) al\-Hamdani**:

Adhere to the rope of the Holy Quran and seek instructions from it\. Regard its lawful as lawful and its unlawful as unlawful\. Testify to the right that has been in the past\. Take lessons for the present condition of this world from the past \(conditions\) because its one phase resembles the other, its end is to meet its beginning, and everything in it is to change and disappear\. Regard the Name of Allah as too great to mention Him save in the matter of righteousness\. Remember death more often and \(what is to come\) after death\. Do not long for death except when depending on a reliable condition\.

Avoid every action the doer of which likes for himself but dislikes for the Muslims in general\. Avoid every action which is performed in secrecy and from which shame is felt openly\. Also avoid the action the doer of which is questioned and he himself regards it as bad or offers excuses for it\. Do not expose your honor to be treated as the subject of people’s talks\. Do not relate to the people all that you hear, for that will amount to falsehood\. Do not contest all that the people relate to you for that will mean ignorance\. Kill your anger and forgive when you have power \(to punish\)\. Show forbearance in the moment of rage and pardon in spite of authority; the eventual end will then be in your favor\. Seek good

<a id="page848"></a>out of every favor that Allah has bestowed on you, and do not waste any favor of Allah over you\. The effect of Allah’s favors over you should be visible on you\.

Be informed that the most distinguished among the believers is one who is the most forward in spending from his own funds on himself, his family and property because whatever good you send forward will remain in store for you and the benefit of whatever you keep behind will be derived by others\. Avoid the company of the person whose opinion is unsound and whose action is detestable because a man is judged after the company which he keeps\.

Live in big cities because they are collective centers of the Muslims\. Avoid places of neglectfulness and wickedness and places where there are paucity of supporters for the obedience of Allah\. Confine your thinking to matters which are helpful to you\. Do not sit in the marketing centers because they are the meeting places of Satan and the targets of mischief mongers\. Frequently look at those over whom you enjoy superiority because this is a way of giving thanks\.

Do not undertake a journey on Friday till you have attended the prayers except when you are going in the way of Allah, or in an excusable matter\. Obey Allah in all your affairs because Allah’s obedience has precedence over all other things\. Lure your heart into worshipping, persuade it and do not force it\. Engage it \(in worshipping\) when it is free and merry, except as regarding the obligations enjoined upon you, for they should not be neglected and must be performed at the five appointed times\. Be on guard lest death should come down upon you while you have fled away from your Lord in search of worldly pleasures\. Avoid the company of the wicked because vice adjoins vice\. Regard Allah as great and love His lovers\. Keep off anger because it is one large army from Satan’s armies, and that is the end of the matter\.

**To Sahl Ibn Hunayf al\-Ansari, His Governor over Medina, about Certain Persons in Medina Who Had Joined Mu\`awiyah**

I have come to know that certain persons from your side are stealthily going over to Mu\`awiyah\. Do not feel sorry for their numbers so lost to you or for their help of which you are deprived\. It is enough that they have gone into misguidance and you have been relieved of them\.

<a id="page849"></a>They are running away from guidance and truth and advancing towards blindness and ignorance\. They are seekers of this world and are proceeding to it, leaping towards it\. They have known justice, seen it, heard it and appreciated it\. They have realized that here, to us, all men are equal in the matter of what is right\. Therefore, they ran away to selfishness and partiality\. Let them remain remote and far away\.

By Allah, surely they have not gone away from oppression nor joined justice\. In this matter, we only desire Allah to resolve for us its hardships and to level for us its unevenness, if Allah wills, and that is the end of the matter\.

**To Mundhir ibn Jarud al\-Abdi Who, in His Administrative Charge, Had Misappropriated Certain Things:**

The good behavior of your father deceived me about you, and I thought that you would follow his way and tread on his path\. But according to what has reached me about you, you are not giving up following your own inclinations and are not retaining any provision for the next world\. You are making this world by ruining your next life and doing good to your kinsmen by cutting yourself off from religion\.

If what has reached me about you is correct, then the camel of your family and the strap of your shoe are better than your own self\. A man with qualities like yours is not fit to close a hole in the ground, nor for performing any deed, nor for increasing his status, nor for taking him as a partner in any trust, nor for trusting him against misappropriation\. Therefore, proceed to me as soon as this letter reaches you if Allah so wills\.

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “Mundhir ibn Jarud al\-Abdi is

the one about whom Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said the following: ‘He

looks very often at his own shoulders, feeling proud of his garments \(appearance\) and usually blowing away \(dust\) from his shoes\.’”

<a id="page850"></a>**Letter 72**

**To Abdullah ibn Abbas**:

You cannot go farther than the limit of your life, nor can you be given a livelihood which is not for you\. Remember that this life consists of two days: a day for you and a day against you, and that the world is a house \(changing\) authorities\. Whatever in it is for you and would come to you despite your weakness, and if anything in it turns against you, it cannot be brought back despite your strength\.

**Letter 73**

**To Mu\`awiyah**:

In exchanging replies and listening to your letters \[as someone reads them for me\], my view has been weak and my intelligence has been erring\. When you refer your demands to me and expect me to send you written replies, you are like one who is in deep slumber while his dreams contradict him, or one who stands perplexed and overwhelmed, not knowing whether what comes to him is for him or against him\. You are not such a man but he is \(to some extent\) like you \(as you are worse than him\)\. I swear by Allah that, had it not been for \(my\) giving you time, you would have faced from me a catastrophe that would have crushed the bones and removed the flesh\. Be informed that Satan has prevented you from turning to good actions and from listening to the words of counsels\. Peace be upon those who deserve it\.

**Document 74**

**Written by Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) as a Protocol Between**

**the Tribes of Rabi\`ah and the People of Yemen, Taken from the**

**Writing of Hisham Ibn \(Muhammad\) al\-Kalbi**:

<a id="page851"></a>This indenture contains what the people of Yemen, including the townsmen and the nomads, in addition to the tribes of Rab\`ah, including the townsmen and the nomads, have agreed on this: that they will adhere to the Book of Allah, will call to it and enjoin according to it and will respond to whoever calls to it and enjoins according to it\. They will not sell it for any price nor accept any alternative for it\. They will join hands against anyone who opposes it and abandons it\. They will help one another\. Their voice will be one\. They will not break their pledge on account of the rebuke of one who rebukes, or of the wrath of an angry person, or the humiliating treatment of one group to the other, or the use of abusive terms by one party against the other\.

**Letter 75**

**To Mu\`awiyah, Soon after Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Was**

**Sworn In\. \(Muhammad Ibn Umar\) al\-Waqidi Has Mentioned this**

**Letter in His Book Kitab al\-Jamal**:

From the servant of Allah, Ali, Ibn Abu Talib, to Mu\`awiyah son of Abu Sufyan: You are aware of my excuses before you, people, and my shunning you till that happened which was inevitable and which could not be prevented\. The story is long and much is to be said\. What was to pass has passed and what was to come has come\. Therefore, secure \(my\) allegiance from those who are with you and come in a deputation of your people to me, and that is the end of the matter\.

**Instruction 76**

**Given to Abdullah ibn Abbas at the time of his appointment at his Governor of Basra**:

Meet people with a broad smile, allow them free audience and pass generous orders\. Avoid anger because it is the augury of Satan\. Remember that whatever takes you near Allah takes you away from the Fire \(of Hell\) and whatever takes you away from Allah takes you near the Fire\.

**Instruction 77**

**To Abdullah ibn Abbas at the Time of His Deputation to**

**Confront the Kharijites:**

<a id="page852"></a>Do not argue with them through the medium of the Holy Quran because the Holy Quran has many faces\. You will say your own and they will say theirs; but argue with them by the Sunnah because they cannot find any escape from it\.

**Letter 78**

**To Abu Musa al\-Ash\`ari in Reply to the Latter’s Letter Regarding the Two Arbitrators\. Sa’id ibn Yahya al\-Umawi Has Mentioned this in His Akitab Al\-Maghazi**:

Certainly, many people have turned away from many a \(lasting\) benefit \(of the next life\), for they bent towards the world and spoke with passion\. I have been struck with wonder in this matter upon which people who are conceited have agreed\. I am providing a cure for their wound but I fear lest it should develop into a clot of blood \(and becomes incurable\)\. Remember that nobody is more desirous than I for the unity of the umma of Muhammad \(h\) and their solidarity\. I seek through it good reward and

an honorable place to return to\.

I shall fulfil what I have pledged upon myself even though you may go back from the sound status that existed when you last left me because wretched is one who is denied the benefit of wisdom and experience\. I feel enraged if anyone utters falsehood, or if I should worsen a matter which Allah has kept sound\. Therefore, leave out what you do not understand because wicked people will be conveying to you vicious things; and that is the end of the matter\.

**Letter 79**

**To the Army Officers When Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\)**

**Became Caliph**:

What ruined those \(nations\) before you was that they denied people their rights, then they had to purchase them \(with bribes\), and they led the people to wrongdoing, and the latter followed their lead\.
