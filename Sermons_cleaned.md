**Sermon 1**

**In this sermon, he recalls the creation of the earth and sky and the birth of Adam:**

Praise is due to Allah Whose worth cannot be described by speakers, whose bounties cannot be counted by calculators and whose claim \(to obedience\) cannot be satisfied by those who attempt to do so, whom the height of intellectual courage cannot appreciate and the depths of understanding cannot reach; He, for whose description no limit has been laid down, no praise exists, no time is ordained and no duration is fixed\. He brought forth creation through His Omnipotence, dispersed winds through His Compassion and made firm the shaking earth with rocks\.

The foremost in religion is the acknowledgment of Him\. The perfection of acknowledging Him is to testify Him\. The perfection of testifying Him is to believe in His Oneness\. The perfection of believing in His Oneness is to regard Him Pure\. The perfection of His purity is to deny Him attributes because every attribute is a proof that it is different from that to which it is attributed and everything to which something is attributed is different from the attribute\. Thus, whoever attaches attributes to Allah recognizes His like\. Who recognizes His like regards Him as two\. Who regards Him as two recognizes parts for Him, and who recognizes parts for Him mistakes Him, and who mistakes Him points at Him, and who points at Him admits limitations for Him, and who admits limitations for Him numbers Him\.

Whoever said in what is He, held that He is contained, and whoever said on what is He held He is not on something else\. He is a Being but not through phenomenon of coming into being\. He Exists but not of non\-Existence\. He is with everything but not in physical nearness\. He is different from everything but not in physical separation\. He acts but without connotation of movements and instruments\. He sees even when there is none to be looked at from among His creation\. He is only

<a id="page325"></a>One, such that there is none with whom He may keep company or whom He may miss in his absence\.

**Creation of the Universe**

He initiated creation and commenced it originally, without undergoing reflection, without making use of any experiment, without innovating any movement and without experiencing any mental aspiration\. He allotted all things their times, put together their variations, gave them their properties and determined their features\. He knew them before creating them, fully realizing their limits and confines and appreciated their propensities and intricacies\.

When the Almighty created the openings of the atmosphere, expanse of firmament and strata of winds, He allowed water, whose waves were stormy and whose surges leapt one over the other, to flow onto it\. He loaded dashing winds and breaking typhoons, ordered them to shed it back \(as rain\), gave the wind control over the vigor of the rain and acquainted it with its limitations\. The wind blew under it while water flowed furiously over it\.

Then, the Almighty created forth wind and made its movement sterile, perpetuated its status, intensified its motion and spread it far and wide\. Then He ordered the wind to raise deep waters and to intensify the waves of the oceans\. So the wind churned the water like the churning of curd and pushed it fiercely into the firmament, throwing its front status on the rear while the stationary status flowed till its level was raised and the surface was full of foam\. Then Almighty raised the foam to the open wind and vast firmament and made therefrom the seven skies\. He made the lower one as a stationary surge and the upper one as protective ceiling and high edifice without any pole to support it or nail to hold it together\. Then He decorated them with stars and the light of meteors and hung in it the shining sun and effulgent moon under the revolving sky, moving the ceiling and rotating firmament\.

**Creation of the Angels**

Then He created the openings between the high skies and filled them with all classes of His angels\. Some of them are in prostration and do not rise\. others are in kneeling positions and do not stand up Some of them are in array and do not leave their status\. others are extolling Allah and do not get tired\. The sleep of the eye or the slip of wit or languor of the body or effect of forgetfulness does not effect them\.

<a id="page326"></a>Among them are those who work as trusted bearers of His message, those who serve, speaking tongues for His prophets and those who carry His orders and injunctions\. Among them are the protectors of His creatures and guards of the doors of the gardens of Paradise\. Among them are those whose steps are fixed on earth but their necks protrude into the skies\. Their limbs are out on all sides, their shoulders are in accord with the columns of the Divine Throne, their eyes are cast down before it, they have spread their wings down under it and they have rendered between themselves and all else curtains of honor and screens of power\. They do not think of their Creator through image, do not impute created attributes to Him, do not confine Him within abodes and do not point at Him through illustrations\.

**Creation of Adam \(x\)**

Allah collected clay from hard, soft, sweet and sour earth, which He moistened with water till it became pure and kneaded it with moisture till it became gluey\. From it He carved an image with curves, joints, limbs and segments\. He solidified it till it dried up for a fixed time and a known duration\. Then He blew into it out of His Spirit whereupon it took the pattern of a human being with a mind that governed him, intelligence which he made use of, limbs that served him, organs that changed his status, sagacity that differentiated between truth and untruth, tastes and smells, colors and species\. He was a mixture of clays of different colors, cohesive materials, divergent contradictories and differing properties like heat, cold, softness and hardness\.

Then Allah asked the angels to fulfil His promise with them and to accomplish the pledge of His injunction to them by acknowledging Him through prostration to Him and submission to His honored status\. So Allah said: “Prostrate to Adam, so they prostrated except Iblis \(Satan\)\. \(Holy Quran, 2: 34; 7: 11; 17: 61; 18: 50; 20: 116\) \. Self\-importance withheld him and vice overcame him\. So that he took pride in his own creation with fire and treated the creation of clay contemptuously\. So Allah allowed him time in order to let him fully deserve His wrath and to complete \(man’s\) test and to fulfil the promise \(He had made to Satan\)\. Thus, He said: “Verily you have been allowed time till the known Day\(Holy Quran, 15: 38, 38: 81\)\.

Thereafter, Allah placed Adam \(x\) in a house where He made his life and his stay safe and He cautioned him of Iblis and his enmity\. Then

<a id="page327"></a>his enemy \(Iblis\) envied Adam’s abiding in Paradise and his contacts with the virtuous\. So he changed his conviction into wavering and determination into weakness\. He thus converted his happiness into fear and his prestige into shame\. Then Allah offered to Adam \(x\) the chance to

repent, taught him words of His Mercy, promised him return to His Paradise and sent him down to the place of trial and procreation of Progeny\.

**Allah Chooses His Prophets **\(x\)

From Adam’s progeny, Allah chose prophets and took their pledge for His revelation and for carrying His message as their trust\. Throughout the course of time many people perverted Allah’s trust with them and ignored His status and took associates along with Him\. Satan turned them away from knowing Allah and kept them aloof from His worship\. Then Allah sent His Messengers and a series of His prophets toward people to get them to fulfil the pledges of His creation, to recall His bounties to them, to exhort them by preaching, to unveil before them the hidden virtues of wisdom and to show them the signs of His Omnipotence\. Of these signs He showed the sky which is raised over them, the earth that is placed beneath them, a means of livelihood to sustain, death that makes them die, ailments that turn them old and incidents that successively betake them\.

Allah never allowed His creation to remain without a Prophet \(h\) deputed by Him, or a book sent down from Him or a binding

argument or a standing plea\. These Messengers were such that they did not feel little because of smallness of their number or the largeness of the number of their falsifiers\. Among them was either a predecessor who would name the one to follow or the follower who had been introduced by the predecessor\.

<a id="page328"></a>**The Prophethood of Muhammad \(h\)**

In this way, ages passed by and times rolled on\. Fathers passed away while sons took their places till Allah deputed Muhammad \(h\) as His Prophet, in fulfillment of His promise and in completion of His Prophethood\. Muhammad’s pledge had been taken from the Prophet \(h\)

s, his traits of character were well reputed and his birth was honorable\. The people of the earth at this time were divided in different parties, their aims were separate and ways were diverse\. They either loved Allah and His creation or twisted His Names or turned to those other than Him\. Through Muhammad \(h\), Allah guided them out of wrong and with his

efforts took them out of ignorance\.

Then Allah chose Muhammad \(h\) to meet Him, selected him for

His own nearness, regarded him too dignified to remain in this world and decided to remove him from this place of trial\. So He drew him towards Himself with honor\. Allah may shower His blessing on him and his progeny\.

**The Holy Quran and the Sunnah**

But the Prophet \(h\) left among you the same that other prophets

left among their people, as Prophets do not leave their people intentionally \(in the dark\) without a clear path and a standing ensign\. He left the Book of your Creator clarifying its permission and prohibitions, its obligations and discretion, its repealing injunctions and the repealed ones, its permissible matters and compulsory ones, its particulars and the general ones, its lessons and illustrations, its long and the short ones, its clear and obscure ones, detailing its abbreviations and clarifying its obscurities\.

In it there are some verses whose knowledge1 is obligatory and others whose ignorance by the people is permissible\. It also contains what appears to be obligatory according to the Book2 but its repeal is signified by the Prophet’s action \(Sunnah\) or that which appears compulsory according to the Prophet’s action but the Book allows not following it\. Or there are those which are obligatory in a given time but not so after that time\. Its prohibitions also differ\. Some are major ones for which there exists the threat of fire \(Hell\) and others are minor ones for which there are prospects of forgiveness\. There are also those of which a small portion is also acceptable \(to Allah\) but they are capable of being expanded\.

<a id="page329"></a>**In this Same Sermon, He Spoke thus about the Hajj:**

Allah has made obligatory upon you the pilgrimage \(hajj\) to His sacred House which is the turning point for the people who go to it as beasts or pigeons go towards spring water\. Allah, the most Glorified One, made it a sign of their supplication before His Greatness and their acknowledgment of His Dignity\. He selected from among His creation those, who on listening to His call, responded to it and testified to His word\. They stood in the status of His Prophets and resembled His angels who surround the Divine Throne securing all the benefits of performing His worship and hastening towards His promised forgiveness\. Allah, the most Glorified One, made it \(His sacred House\) an emblem for Islam and an object of respect for those who turn to it\. He made obligatory its pilgrimage and laid down its claim for which He held you responsible to discharge it\. Thus, Allah, the most Glorified One, said:

“Allah \(purely\) for Allah, is incumbent upon mankind, the pilgrimage to the House, for those who can afford to journey thither\. And whoever denies, then verily Allah is Self\-sufficiently independent of the Worlds” \(Holy Quran, 3: 96\)\.

The foremost in religion \(din\) is His knowledge\. The literal meaning of din is obedience and its popular sense is a code\. whether the literal sense is taken or the popular one, in either case, if the mind is devoid of any conception of Divinity, there would be no question of obedience, nor of following any code because when there is no aim there is no point in advancing towards it\. Where there is no object in view there is no sense in making efforts to achieve it\. Nevertheless, when the nature and guiding faculty of man bring him in contact with a superior Authority and his taste for obedience and impulse of submission subjugates him before a Deity, he finds himself bound by certain limitations as against abject freedom of activity\. These very limitations are din \(religion\) whose point of commencement is knowledge of Allah and acknowledgment of His Being\.

After pointing out the essentials of the Divine knowledge Amir, al\-Mu’minin has described its important constituents and conditions\. He holds those stages of such knowledge which people generally regard as the point of highest approach to be insufficient\. He says that its first stage is that with the natural sense of search for the unknown and the guidance of conscience or on hearing from the followers of religions an image of the Unseen Being known as Allah is formed in the mind\. This image, in

<a id="page330"></a>fact, is the forerunner of the obligation to thinking and reflection and to seeking His knowledge\. But those who love idleness, or are under pressure of environment, do not undertake this search despite the creation of such an image and the image fails to get testified\. In this case they remain deprived of the Divine knowledge\. Since access to the stage of testifying after the formation of image is by volition, they deserve to be questioned about it\. But one who is moved by the power of this image goes further and considers thinking and reflection necessary\. In this way one reaches the next stage in the attainment of the Divine knowledge, namely to search for the Creator through diversification of the creation and species of creatures\. This is so because every picture is a solid and inflexible guide to the existence of its painter and every effect to the action of its cause\. When he casts his glance around himself he does not find a single thing which might have come into existence without the act of a maker so much so that he does not find the sign of a footstep without a walker nor a construction without a builder\. How can he comprehend that this blue sky with the sun and the moon in its expanse and the earth with the exuberance of its grass and flowers could have come into existence without the action of a Creator? therefore, after observing all that exists in the world and the regulated system of the entire creation no one can help but conclude that there is a Creator for this world of diversities because existence cannot come out of non\-existence, nor can existence sprout forth from nothingness\.

The Holy Quran has pointed to this reasoning thus: “What?\! about Allah is there any doubt, the Originator of the heavens and the earth? \(14: 10\)

But this stage would also be insufficient if this testimony in favor of Allah is tarnished by belief in the divinity of some other deity\.

The third stage is that His existence should be acknowledged along with belief in Unity and Oneness\. Without this the testimony to Allah’s existence cannot be complete because if more gods are believed in, He would not be One\. Whereas it is necessary that He should be One\. The reason is that in case of more than one god the question would arise whether one of them created all this creation or all of them together\. If one of them created it there should be some difference to distinguish him, otherwise, he would be accorded preferential status without reason, which is unacceptable to the mind\. If all have created it collectively then the status has only two forms; either he cannot perform his functions without the assistance of others or he is above the need for their assistance\. The first case means he is incapable and in need of others while the other case

<a id="page331"></a>means that there are several regular performers of a single act and the fallacy of both has already been shown\. If we assume that all the gods performed the act of creation by dividing it among themselves, all the creation would not bear the same relationship towards the creator\. This is so because each creature will bear relationship only to its own creator whereas every creature should have one and the same relationship to all creators\. This is so because all the creation should have one and the same relationship to all the creators as all the created in their capacity to accept effect and all the creators in their capacity to produce effect should be similar\. In short there is no way but to acknowledge Him as One because to believe in numerous creators allows no possibility of the existence of any other thing and destruction proves implicit for the earth, the sky and everything in creation\. Allah, the most Glorified One, has expressed his argument in the following words:

Had there been in the heavens and the earth \[other\]\) gods except Allah, they both \(the heavens and the earth would have been\) in disorder\. \(Holy Quran, 21: 22\)\.

The fourth stage is that Allah should be regarded free of all defects and deficiencies, devoid of body, form, illustration, similarity, status of place or time, motion, stillness, incapability and ignorance\. This is so because there can be no deficiency or defect in the perfect Being nor can anyone be deemed like Him because all these attributes bring down a being from the high status of the Creator to the low status of the created\. That is why along with Unity, Allah has held purity from deficiency of equal importance\.

Say: He \(Allah\) is One \(alone\)\. Allah, the needless\. He begets not, nor is He begotten\. And there is none like unto Him\. \(Holy Quran, 112: 1\-4\)\.

Vision perceives Him not and He perceives \(all\) vision; He is the Subtle, the All\-aware\. \(Holy Quran, 6: 104\)\.

So coin you not any similitudes to Allah; verily Allah knows \(everything\) and you know not\. \(Holy Quran, 16: 74\)\.

Nothing whatsoever \(is the re\) like the like of Him, and He \(alone\) is the All\-Hearing and the All\-Seeing\.\(Holy Quran, 42: 11\)

The fifth stage of completing His Knowledge is that attributes should not be put on Him from outside lest there be duality in His

<a id="page332"></a>Oneness\. Deviating from its proper connotation, Unity may fall into the labyrinth of one\-in\-three and three \-in\-one because His Being is not a combination of essence and form so that attributes may cling to Him like the smell of the flowers or brightness in the stars\. Rather, He is the fountainhead of all attributes and needs no medium for manifestation of His perfect Attributes\. If He is named Omniscient it is because the signs of his knowledge are manifest\. If He is called Omnipotent it is because every particle points to His Omnipotence and Activity\. If the power to listen or to see is attributed to him, it is because the cohesion of the entire creation and its administration cannot be done without hearing or seeing\. But the existence of these attributes in Him cannot be held in the same way as in the creation\. He should be capable to know only after He acquires knowledge or He should be powerful and strong only after energy runs into His limbs because taking attributes as separate from His Being would connote duality and where there is duality unity disappears\. That is how Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) has rejected the idea of attributes

being in addition to His Being, presented Unity in its true significance and did not allow Unity to be tainted with stains of multiplicity\. This does not mean that adjectives cannot at all be attributed to Him\. This would be giving support to those who are groping in the dark abyss of negativism, although every nook and corner in the entire Existence is brimming with His attributes and every particle of creation stands witness that He has knowledge, He is powerful, He hears and He sees\. He nurtures under His care and allows growth under His mercy\. The intention is that for Him, nothing can be suggested to serve as an adjunct to Him because His Self includes attributes and His attributes connote His Self\. Let us learn this very theme in the words of Imam Abu \`Abdillah Ja\`far ibn Muhammad as\-Sadiq \(x\) comparing it with the belief in Unity adopted by other

religions then appreciate who is the exponent of the true concept of Unity\.

**The Imam says the following:**

Our Lord, the Glorified One, the magnificent One, has knowledge of Himself even though there was nothing to know, sight of Himself even though there is nothing to behold, hearing of Himself even though there is nothing to hear and Power of Himself even though there is nothing under His Power\. When He created the things and the object of knowledge came into existence, His knowledge became related to the known, hearing related to the heard, sight related to the seen and Power related to its object\. \(At\-Tawhid by Shaikh as\-Saduq, p\.139\)\.

<a id="page333"></a>This is the belief about which the Imams from among the Prophet’s family are unanimous, but the majority group \[of the Muslims, i\.e\. the Sunnis\] has adopted a different course by creating the idea of differentiation between His Self and Attributes\. Shahristani says the following on, p\. 42 of his book Kitab al\-Milal wal\- Nihal: “According to Abul\-Hassan al\-Ash\`ari Allah knows through \(the attribute of\) knowledge, is Powerful through activity, speaks through speech, hears through hearing and sees through sight\.”

If we regard attributes distinct from Self in this manner there would be two alternatives; either the attributes must have existed in Him or they must have occurred later\. In the first case we have to recognize as many eternal objects as the attributes which all will share with Him in being eternal, but Allah is above that which people deem Him to have equals\. In the second case, in addition to subjecting Him to the alternations, it would also mean that before the acquiring of the attributes He was neither knowledgeable, nor powerful, nor hearer nor beholder, and this runs counter to the basic tenet of Islam\.

Allah has decreed trade lawful and has forbidden interest\. \(Holy Quran, 2: 275\)

And when you have finished the prayer remember Allah standing and sitting and reacting and when you are secure \(from danger\) establish prayer\. \(Holy Quran, 4: 103\)\.

O you men\! Eat of what is in the earth lawful and good and follow not the foot\-steps of Satan; for verily he is an open enemy unto you\. \(Holy Quran, 2: 168\)\.

\(And\) say: I am only a man like you, it is revealed unto me that your god is but one Allah, therefore, whosoever desires to meet his Master, let him do good deeds and associate not anyone in the worship of his Master\. \(Holy Quran, 18: 110\)\.

What\! enjoin you upon the people righteousness and you forget your own selves? Yet you read the scripture? What?\! Do you not understand?\! \(Holy Quran, 2: 44\)\.

2\. About the Holy Quran, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) says that it

contains description of the permitted and forbidden acts such as Allah has allowed the sale and purchase but prohibited usury\.

<a id="page334"></a>It clarifies obligatory and optional acts such as AWhen you have finished the prayer, remember Allah rising, sitting or lying and when you feel safe \(from the enemy\) then say the prayers \(as usual\) \(4: 104\)\.

Here, prayer is obligatory while other forms of remembering \(Allah\) are optional\. It has repealing and repealed verses such as about the period of seclusion after the husband’s death: four months and ten days, or the repealed one such as: till one year without going out\. This shows that this period of seclusion should be one year\. In particular places it permits what is forbidden such as: “Whoever is compelled, without being willfully wrongful or transgressing, commits no sins\.”

It has positive injunctions such “One should not add anyone with Allah in worship\. It has particular and general injunctions\. Particular is the one where the word shows generality but the sense is limited such as: “I have made you superior to other nations of the world, O Banu Isra’il\.”

Here, the meaning of “nations of the world” is confined to that particular time, although the word is general in its literal meaning\. The general injunction is one which is extensive in meaning such as Allah has knowledge of everything\. It has lessons and illustrations such as Allah caught him in the punishment of this world and the next and there is a lesson in it\.

So Allah seized him, with the chastisement in the hereafter and the life before \(it\) \(Holy Quran\. 79: 25\)

Verily in this there is a lesson unto him who fears \(Allah\)\. \(Holy Quran, 79: 26\)

A kind word and pardon is better than charity that is followed by injury and verily Allah is Self\-sufficient, the Most forbearing\. \(Holy Quran, 2: 263\)

And remember when We made a covenant with you and raised the Tur \(mountain\) above you \(saying\): Hold you fast that which We have bestowed upon you with the strength \(of determination\) and remember that which is the rein so that you may guard \(yourself\) against evil\. \(Holy Quran, 2: 63\)

So we made it a lesson for \(those of\) their own times and for those \(of their posterity\) who came after them and an exhortation unto those who guard \(themselves\) against evil\. \(Holy Quran, 2: 66\)

<a id="page335"></a>He it is Who fashions you in the wombs \(of your mothers\) as He likes; There is no god but He, the All\-mighty, the al\-Wise\. \(Holy Quran, 3: 5\)

Obedience and a fair word; but when the affair is determined then if they be true to Allah, it would certainly be better for them\. \(Holy Quran, 47: 21\)

O those who believe\! It is not lawful for you to inherit women against their will, and do not straiten them in order that you may take a part of what you have given, unless they are guilty of manifest lewdness; but deal kindly with them and if you hate them, it may be that you hate a thing while Allah has placed in it abundant good\. \(Holy Quran, 4: 19\)

Say \(to the People of the Book\):You dispute with us about Allah, while He is our Master and your Master, and for us are our deeds and for you are yours; to Him \(Alone\) we are \(exclusively\) loyal? \(Holy Quran, 2: 139\)

There is a lesson in it for whoever fears Allah, and illustrations such as “The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is like a grain which grows seven ears each one of which bears hundred grains\.” It has unspecific and specific verses\. Unspecific is one which has no limitation on specification such as “Recall when Moses told his people Allah commands you to sacrifice a cow\.”

Specific is one where denotation is limited as Allah says that Athe cow should be such that it has neither been used for ploughing nor for irrigation fields\. There is clarity and obscurity in it\. The clarity is that which has no intricacy such as “Verily Allah has sway over everything,” while the obscurity is whose meaning has complication such as “\.\.\. the Merciful One \(Allah\) occupies the throne” the apparent meaning of which gives the impressions as if Allah is physically “sitting” on the Throne although the intention is to underscore His authority and control\. In it there are brief injunctions such as “Establish prayer” and those of deep meanings such as the verses about which says the following: The meaning is not known except to Allah and to those immersed in knowledge\. Then Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) deliberates on this theme in a different way, saying

that there are some things in it which are necessary to know, such as: “So be informed that there is no god except Allah” and there are others which are not necessary to know such as Aleef, laam, meem, etc\. It has also injunctions which have been repealed by the Prophet’s actions such as

<a id="page336"></a>“As for your women who commit adultery, get four male witnesses, and if four witnesses do appear, shut such women in the house till death ends their life\.” This punishment was current in early Islam but was later replaced by stoning in the case of married women\. In it, there are some injunctions which repealed the Prophet’s actions such as “Turn your face towards Masjid al\-Haram by which the injunction for facing Bayt al\-Maqdis \(Jerusalem\) was repealed\. It also contains injunctions which are obligatory only at a particular time was repealed\. It also contains injunctions which are obligatory only at a particular time after which their obligation ends, such as “When the call for prayer is made on Friday, hasten towards remembrance of Allah\.” It has also indicated grades of prohibitions as the division of sins into light and serious ones such as “Tell the believers to lower their gaze” and serious ones such as “Whoever kills a believer willfully, his penalty is to remain in Hell forever\.” It also contains injunctions where a little performance is enough but there is scope for further performance such as “Read the Holy Quran as much as you can\.”

Verily your Master, certainly is He the All\-mighty, the All\-merciful\. \(Holy Quran, 26: 9\)

Say \(O Our Prophet Muhammad \[h\]\) to the believing men that

they should cast down their gaze and guard their private parts; that is purer for them; verily Allah is All\-aware of whatever you do\. \(Holy Quran, 24: 30\)

Not equal are those of the believers who sit \(holding back\) to those who are hurt and who strive in the way of Allah with their wealth and selves \(lives\)\. Allah has raised the strivers with their wealth and selves \(lives\) in rank above those sitting \(holding back\); to all \(faithful\) Allah has promised good: but those who strive He has distinguished above those who sit \(linger behind and not go out to fight for the faith\) a great recompense\. \(Holy Quran, 4: 95\)

Verily, your Lord knows that you stand up \(during the night for the night prayers\) two\-thirds of the night and \(sometimes\) half of it and \(sometimes\) a third of it and\(so does\) a group of those with you, and Allah measures \(well\) the night and the day; He knows that you can never take \(correct\) account of it, so He turns to you \(mercifully\); recite, then, whatever is easy \(in the prayers\) to be read of the Holy Quran; He knows that there may be among you those who are sick and others traveling in the earth seeking of the grace of Allah and others fighting in the way of Allah, so recite as much as it can easily be done of it and

<a id="page337"></a>establish the \(regular\) prayers and pay the \(prescribed\) zakat and offer unto Allah a goodly loan\. Whatsoever good \(deeds\) you send forth before hand for yourselves, you will \(surely\) find it with Allah, that is the best and the greatest recompense, and seek the forgiveness of Allah; Verily, Allah if Oft\-forgiving, most Merciful\. \(Holy Quran, 73: 20\)

**Sermon 2**

**Delivered on return from Siffn before his Nomination by the Prophet \(h\) for the Caliphate**

I praise Allah, seeking completion of His Blessing, submitting to His Glory and expecting safety from committing His sins\. I invoke His help being in need of His Sufficiency \(of protection\)\. He whom He guides does not get astray\. He with whom He is hostile gets no protection\. He whom He supports does not remain needy\. Praise is most weighty of all that is weighed and the most valuable of all that is treasured\.

I testify that there is no god but Allah the One\. He has no like\. My testimony has been tested in its frankness and its essence shall store it facing the tribulations that overtake us because it is the foundation stone of Belief \(iman\) and the first step toward good actions and the Divine pleasure\. It is the means to keep Satan away\.

I also testify that Muhammad \(h\) is the Prophet\. Allah sent him with the illustrious religion, effective emblem, written Book,113effulgent light, sparkling gleam and decisive in junctions in order to dispel doubts, present clear proofs, administer warning through signs and to warn of punishments\. At that time people had fallen in vices whereby the rope of religion had been broken, the pillars of belief had been shaken, principles had been desecrated, system had become topsy turvy, openings were narrow, passage was dark, guidance was unknown

and darkness prevailed\.

Allah was being disobeyed, Satan was given support and Belief had been forsaken\. As a result the pillars of religion fell down, its traces could not be discerned, its passages had been destroyed and its streets had fallen into decay\. People obeyed Satan and tread his paths\. They sought

113This is a reference to the Preserved Tablet\.

<a id="page338"></a>water from his watering places\. Through them Satan’s emblems flew and his standard was raised in vices which trampled the people under their hoofs and treaded upon them with their feet\. The vices stood on their toes \(in full stature\) and the people immersed in them were strayed, perplexed, ignorant and seduced as though in a Good House114 with bad neighbors\. Instead of sleep, they had wakefulness, and for antinomy, they had tears in the eyes\. They were a land where the learned were in bridle \(keeping their mouths shut\) while the ignorant were honored\.

In the same sermon, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) referred to Ahl al\-

Bayt \(x\) \(the Household of the Holy Prophet \(h\)\) as follows:

They are the trustees of His secrets, shelter for His affairs, source of knowledge about Him, center of His wisdom, valleys for His books and mountains of His religion\. With them, Allah straightened the bend of religion’s back and removed the trembling of its limbs\.

In the same sermon, he spoke about the hypocrites thus:

They sowed vices, watered them with deception and harvested destruction\. Non in the Islamic community can be taken at par with the Progeny115

114The “Good House” means Mecca, while the “bad neighbors” phrase refers to unbelieving Quraishites\.

115About the Progeny of the Prophet \(h\), Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) has said

that nobody in the world can be at par with them, nor can anyone be deemed their equal in sublimity because the world is over laden with their obligations and has been able to secure eternal blessings only through their guidance\. They are the corner stone and foundation of religion and the sustenance for its life and survival\. They are such strong pillars of knowledge and belief that they can turn away the stormy flow of doubt and suspicion\. They are such middle course among the paths of excess and backwardness that if some one goes far toward excess and exaggeration or falls behind then unless he comes back or steps forward to that middle course, he cannot be on the path of Islam\. They possess all the characteristics which give the superiority in the right for vicegerency and leadership\. Consequently, no one else in the _umma_ enjoys the right of patronage and guardianship\. That is why the Prophet \(h\) declared them his vicegerents and

successors\. About will and succession the commentator ibn Abul\-Hadid, the Mu’tazilite scholar, writes that there can be no doubt about the vicegerency of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) but succession cannot imply succession in status although the

Shi\`ite sect has so interpreted it\. It rather implies succession of learning\. Now, if according to him succession is taken to imply succession in learning even he does

<a id="page339"></a>of the Prophet \(h\) \(Ahl al\-Bayt \[x\]\)\. One who was under their obligation

cannot be matched with them\. They are the foundation of religion and the pillar of belief\. The forward runner has to turn back to them while the follower has to overtake them\. They possess the chief characteristics for vicegerency\. In their favor exists the will and succession \(of the Prophet \(h\)\)\. This is the time when right has returned to its owner and diverted to

its center of return\.

**Sermon 3**

**Known as the sermon as ash\-Shaqshaqiyya 1**

**Beware\! By Allah, the son of Abu Quhafah \(Abu Bakr\) 2 dressed himself with it \(the caliphate\) and he certainly knew that my status in relationship to it was the same as the status of the axis in relationship to the hand\-mill\. The flood water flows down from me and the bird cannot fly up to me\. I put a curtain against he caliphate and kept myself detached from it\.**

Then I began to think whether I should assault or endure calmly the blinding darkness of tribulations wherein the grown up are feeble and

no seem to succeed in achieving his object because even by this interpretation the right of succeeding the Prophet \(h\) does not devolve on any other person\. It is

agreed upon that learning is the most essential requirement of _khalifah_ \(caliphate\) because the most important of functions of the Prophet’s Caliph consist of dispensation of justice, solving problems of religious laws, clarifying intricacies and administration of religious penalties\. If these functions are taken away from the Prophet’s deputy, his status will come down to that of a worldly ruler\. He cannot be regarded as the pivot of religious authority\. Therefore, either we should keep governmental authority separate from Prophet’s vicegerency or accept the successor of the Prophet’s knowledge to suit that status\.

The interpretation of Ibn Abul\-Hadid could be acceptable if Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) had uttered this sentence alone, but observing that it was uttered soon

after Ali’s \(x\) recognition as Caliph and just after it the sentence “Right has

returned to its owner” exists, this interpretation of his seems baseless\. Rather, the Prophet’s will cannot imply any other will except that for vicegerency and caliphate and succession would imply not succession in property nor in knowledge because this was not an occasion to mention it here\. But, it must mean the succession in the right leadership which stood proved as from Allah not only on the ground of kinship, but on the ground of qualities of perfection\.

<a id="page340"></a>the young grow old and the true believer acts under strain till he meets Allah \(on this death\)\. I found that endurance thereon was wiser\. So I adopted patience although there was pricking in the eye and suffocation \(of mortification\) in the throats\. I watched the plundering of my inheritance till the first one went his way but handed over the Caliphate to ibn al\-Khattab after himself\.

Then he quoted a verse by al\-A’sha and went on to say:

My days are now passed on the camel’s back \(in difficulty\) while there were days \(of ease\) when I enjoyed the company of Ja bir’s brother Hayyan\.3

It is strange that during his lifetime he wished to be released from the caliphate but he confirmed it for the other one after his death\. No doubt these two shared its udders strictly among themselves\. This one put the caliphate in a tough enclosure where the utterance was haughty and the touch was rough\. Mistakes were in plenty and also the excuses therefore\. One in contact with it was like the rider of an unruly camel\. If he pulled up its rein the very nostril would be slit, but if he let it loose he w9ould be thrown\. Consequently, by Allah, people got involved in recklessness, wickedness, unsteadiness and deviation\.

Nevertheless, I remained patient despite a length of period and stiffness of trial, until when he went his way \(of death\) he put the matter \(of Caliphate\) in a group4 and regarded me to be one of them\. But good Heavens\! What had I to do with his “consultation”? Where was any doubt about me with regard to the first of them that I was now considered akin to these ones? But I remained low when they were low and flew high when they flew high\. One of them turned against me because of his hatred and the other got inclined the other way due to his in\-law relationship and this thing and that thing, till the third man of these people stood up with heaving breasts between his dung and fodder\. With him his children of the grand\-father \(Umayyah\) also stood up, swallowing up Allah’s wealth5 like a camel devouring the foliage of spring, till his rope broke down, his actions finished him and his gluttony brought him down prostrate\.

At that moment, nothing took me by surprise, but the crowd of people rushing to me\. It advanced toward me form every side like the mane of the hyena so much so that Hassan and Hussain were getting crushed and both the ends of my shoulder garment were torn\. They collected around me like the herd of sheep and goats\. When I took up the reins of government, one party broke away and another turned

<a id="page341"></a>disobedient while the rest began acting wrongfully as if they had not heard the word of Allah saying:

That abode in the hereafter, We assign if for those who intend not to exult themselves in the earth, nor \(to make\) mischief \(the rein\), and the end is \(best\) for the pious\. \(Holy Quran 28: 83\)

Yes, by Allah, they had heard it and understood it but the world appeared glittering in their eyes and its embellishments seduced them\. Behold, by Him who split the grain \(to grow\) and created living beings, if people had not come to me and supporters had not exhausted the argument and if there had been no pledge of Allah with the learned to the effect that they should no acquiesce in the gluttony of the oppressor and the hunger of the oppressed, I would have cast the rope of Caliphate on its own shoulders and would have given the lst one the same treatment as to the first one\. Then you would have seen that in my view this world of yours is not better than the sneezing of a goat\.

It is said that when Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) reached this point in his sermon, a man from Iraq stood up and handed him something in writing\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) began looking at it, whereupon Ibn Abbas said, “O Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\), I wish you resumed your sermon from

where you broke it\.” Thereupon, he replied, “O Ibn Abbas, it was like the foam of a camel which gushed out but subsided\.” Ibn Abbas said that he never grieved over any utterance as he did over this one because Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) could not finish it as he wished to\.

Ash\-Sharif ar\-Radi says the following: The words in this sermon Alike the rider of a camel mean to convey that when a camel rider is stiff in drawing up the rein then in this scuffle the nostril gets bruised, but if he lets it loose in spite of the camel’s unruliness, it would thrown him somewhere and would get out of control\. Ash\-shaqshaqah is used when the rider holds up the rein and raises the camel’s head upwards\. In the same sense the word Ashanaqa an\-naqah is use\. Ibn as\-Sikkit \(the renown linguist\) has mentioned this in Islah al\-Mantiq\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) has

said, “ashnaqa laha” instead of “aslasa laha” and harmony could be retained only by using both in the same form\. Thus, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) has used “ashanaq laha” as though in place of “in rafa’a laha ra saha”, that is, “If he stops it by holding up the reins, etc\.”

<a id="page342"></a>1. This sermon is known as the sermon as ash\-Shaqshaqiyya and is counted among the most famous sermons of Amir al\-Mu’minin\. It was delivered at ar\-Rahbah\. Although some people have denied it to be Amir al\-Mu’minin’s utterance and, by attributing it to Sayyid ar\-Radi \(or ash\-Sharif ar\-Radi\), have laid blame on the integrity of his acknowledge, yet truth\-loving scholars have denied its veracity\. Nor can there be any ground for this denial because Ali’s difference of view in the matter of Caliphate is not a secret matter, so that such hints should be regarded as something alien\. And, the events which have been alluded to in this sermon are preserved in the annals of history which testify to them word by word and sentence by sentence\. If the same events, which are related by history, are recounted by Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\), then what is the ground for denying them? If the memory of discouraging circumstance faced by him soon after the death of the Prophet \(h\) appeared

unpalatable to him, it should not be surprising\. No doubt, this sermon hits at the prestige of certain personalities and gives a set back to the faith and belief in them, but this cannot be sustained by denying the sermon to be Amir al\-Mu’minin’s utterance, unless the true events are analyzed and truth unveiled\. otherwise, just denying it to be Amir al\-Mu’minin’s utterance because it contains disparagement of certain individuals carries no weight, when other historians have related similar criticism as well\. Thus \(Abu Othman\) Amr ibn Bahr al\-Jahiz has recorded the following words of a sermon of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) and thy are not less weighty

than the criticism in the Sermon of ash\-Shaqshaqiyya\.

Those two passed away and the third one rose like the crow whose courage is confined to the belly\. It would have been better if both his wings had been cut and his head severed\.

Consequently, the idea that it is the production of Sayyid ar\-Radi is far from the truth and a result of partisanship and partiality\. Or else if it is the result of some research, it should be bought out\. otherwise, remaining in such wishful illusion does not alter the truth, nor can the force of decisive arguments be curbed down by mere disagreement and displeasure\.

Now, we set forth the testimony of those scholars and traditionists who have clearly held it to be Amir al\-Mu’minin’s production, so that its historical importance should become known\. Among these scholars, some are those before Sayyid ar\-Radi’s period, some are his contemporaries and some are those who came after him but they all related it through their own chain of authority\.

<a id="page343"></a>1. Ibn Abul\-Hadid al\-Mu’tazili writes that his master, Abul\-Khayr Masaddiq ibn Shabib al\-Sasiti \(d\. 605 A\.H\), states that he heard this sermon from Shaikh Abu Muhammad Abdullah ibn Amad al\-Baghdadi \(d\. 567 A\.H\.\), known as Ibn al\-Khashshab and when he reached where Ibn Abbas expressed sorrow for this sermon having remained incomplete, Ibn al\-Khashshab said to him that if he had heard the expression of sorrow from ibn \`Abbas, he would have certainly asked him if there had remained with his cousin any further unsatisfied desire because excepting the Prophet \(h\), he had already spared neither the

predecessors nor followers and had uttered all that he wished to utter\. Therefore, why should there by any sorrow that he could not say what he wished? Musaddiq says that ibn al\-Khashshab was a man of folly heart and decent taste\. I inquired form him whether he also regarded the sermon to be a fabrication when he replied, “By Allah, I believe it to be Amir al\-Mu’minin’s word as I believe you to Musaddiq ibn Shabib\. I said that some people regard it to be Sayyid ar\- Radi’s production when he replied, “Who can ar\-Radi have such guts or such style of writing\. I have seen Sayyid ar\-Radi’s writings and know his style of composition\. Nowhere does his writing match with this one and I have already seen it in books written two hundred years before the birth of Sayyid ar\- Radi and I have seen it in familiar writings about which I know by which scholars or men of letters they were compiled\. At that time not only ar\-Radi, but even his father Abu Ahmed an\-Naqib had not been born\.

1. Thereafter ibn Abul\-Hadid writes that he saw this sermon in the compilations of his master abu\-l\-Qasim \(Abdullah ibn Ahmed\) al\-Balkhi \(d\. 317 A\.H\)\. He was the Imam of the Mu’tazilites in the reign of al\-Muqtadir\-Billah while al\-Muqtadir’s period was far earlier than the birth of Sayyid ar\-Radi\.
2. He further writes that he saw this sermon in Abu Ja\`far \(Muhammad ibn Abd ar\-Rahman\), Ibn Qibah’s book Al\-Insaf\. He was the pupil of Abul\-Qasim al\-Balkhi and a theologian of the Imamiyya \(Shi\`ite\) sect\. See the Sharh of Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 1, pp\. 205\-206\.
3. Ibn Maytham al\-Bahrani \(d\. 679 A\.H\.\) writes in his commentary that he had seen one such copy of this sermon which bore the writing of al\-Muqtadir Billah’s minister Abul Hassan Ali ibn Muhammad ibn al\-Furat \(d\. 312 A\.H\.\)\. Sharh al\-Balagha, Vol\. 1l, pp\. 252\-253

<a id="page344"></a>1. Al\-Allama Muhammad Baqir al\-Majlisi has related the following chain of authority about this sermon from Shaikh Qutbud\-Din ar\-Rawandi’s compilation of Minhaj al\-Bard’ah fi Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha: 2. In the context, Allama al\-Majlisi has written that his sermon is also co ntined in the compilations of Abu Ali \(Muhammad ibn Abdul\-Wahhab\) al\-Juba’i \(d\. 303 A\.H\.\) 3. In connection with this very authenticity Allama al\-Majlisi writes the following:

Al\-Qadi Abdul\-Jabbar ibn Ahmed al\-Asad\-Abadi \(d\. 415 A\.H\.\) who was a strict Mu’tazilite explains some expressions of this sermon in his book Al\-Mughni and tries to prove that it does not strike against any preceding caliph but does not deny it to be Amir al\-Mu’minin’s composition\. \(ibid\. p\. 161\)

1. Abu Ja\`far Muhammad ibn Ali, Ibn Babawayh \(d\. 381 A\.H\.\) writes the following:

Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Ishaq at\-Talaqani told us that Abdul\-Aziz ibn Yahya al \-Jalludi \(d\. 332 A\.H\.\) told him that Abu Abdillah Ahmed ibn Ammar ibn Khalid told him that Yahya ibn Abdul\-Hamid al\-Himmani \(d\. 228 A\.H\) told him that Isa ibn Rashad related this sermon from Ali \(x\) ibn Hudhayfah and he from \`Ikrimah and he from Ibn Abbas\. \(Ilal ash\-Shara’i’, Vol\. 1, pp\. 122, p\. 144: Ma’ani al\-Akhbar, cha, p\. 22,

1. 360\-361\)\.
   1. then Ibn Babawayh records the following chain of authorities:

Muhammad ibn Ali Majilawayh related this sermon to us and he took it from his uncle Muhammad ibn Abul\-Qasim and he form Ahmed ibn Abu Abdillah \(Muhammad ibn Khalid\) al\-Barqi and he from his father and he from \(Muhammad\) ibn Abu Umayr and he from Aban ibn Othman and he from Aban ibn Taghlib and he from \`Ikrimah and he from Ibn Abbas\. \(AIlal al \-Shara’i’, Vol\. 1, cha, p\. 122, p\. 146; Ma’ani al\-Akhbar, pp\. 22, 361\)\.

1. Abu Ahmed al\-Hassan ibn Abdillah ibnSa’id al\-‘Askari \(d; 382 A\.H\.\) who counts among great scholars of the Sunnis has written commentary and explanation of this sermon that has been recorded by ibn Babawayh in AIlal ash\-shara’i’ and Ma\`aani al\-Akhbar\.

<a id="page345"></a>11\) As\-Sayyid Ni’matullah al\-Jaza’iri writes the following:

The author of Kitab al \-Gharz, namely Abu Ishaq Ibrahim ibn Muhammad al\-Thaqafi al \-Kufi \(d\. 283 A\.H\.\), has related this sermon through his own chain of authorities\. The date of completion of writing this book is Tuesday the 13th Shawwal 255 A\.H\. And in the same year, Murtada al\-Musawi was born\. He was older in age than his brother Sayyid ar\-Radi \(Al\-Anwar an\-Nu’maniyya, p\.37\)\.

1. Sayyid Radi ad\-Din Abul\-Qasim Ali ibn Musa, Ibn Tawus al\-Hussaini al\-Hilli \(d\. 664 A\.H\.\) has related this sermon from Kitab al\-Gharz with the following chain of authorities:

This sermon was related to us by Muhammad ibn Yusuf who related it from al\-Hassan ibn Ali ibn \`Abdul\-Karim az\-Za’far Sa’id and he form Muhammad ibn Zakariyyah al\-Ghallabi and he from Ya’qub ibn Ja\`far ibn Sulayman and he from his father and he from his grandfather and he from ibn \`Abbas\. \(Translation of Al\-Tara’if, p\. 202\)

1. Shaikh al\-Ta’ifa, Muhammad ibn al\-Hassan at\-Tusi \(d\. 460 A\.H\.\) writes the following:

\(Abul\- Fath Hilal ibn Muhammad ibn Ja\`far\) al\-Haffar related this sermon to us\. He related it from Abul\-Qasim \(Isma’il ibn Ali ibn Ali \(Du’bul and he from his father and he from his brother Du’bul \(ibn Ali al\-Khuza’i\) and he from Muhammad ibn Salamah al\-Shami and he from Zurarh ibn A’yan and he from Abu Ja\`far Muhammad ibn Ali \(Shaikh al\-Saduq\) and he from Ibn Abbas \(Al\-Amli, p\. 237\)\.

1. Shaikh al\-Mufid \(Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn an\-Nu’man, \(d\. 413 A\.H\.\) who was the teacher of Sayyid ar\-Radi writes about he chain of authorities of this sermon;

A number of narrators of traditions have related this sermon form ibn Abbas through numerous chains \(Al\-Irshad, p\. 135\)\.

1. Alam al\-Huda \(flag\-posts of guidance\) Sayyid al\-Murtada, who was the elder brother of Sayyid ar\-Radi, has recorded it on pp\. 203\-204 of his book Al\-Shafi\.
2. Abu Mansur at\-Tibrisi writes the following:

<a id="page346"></a>A number of relaters have given an account of this sermon from Ibn Abbas through various chains\. Ibn Abbas said that he was in the audience of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) at ar\-Rahba \(a place in Kufa which remains bearing this name\) when conversation turned to caliphate and those who had preceded him as Caliphs when Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) berated a sign and delivered this sermon\.116

1. Abul\-Muzaffar Yusuf ibn Abdillah and Sibt ibn al\-Jawzi al\-Hanafi \(d\. 654 A\.H\.\) write the following:

Our Shaikh Abul Qasim an\-Nafis al \-Anbari related this sermon to us through his chain of authorities that ends with ibn Abbas, who said that after allegiance had been paid to Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) as caliph, he was sitting on the pulpit when a man from the audience inquired why he had remained quiet still then, whereupon Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) delivered this sermon ex\-tempore\. \(Tadhkirat Khawass al\-Umma, p\. 73\)

1. Judge Ahmed ibn Muhammad, ash\-Shihab al\-Khafaji \(d\.

1069 A\.H\.\) writes the following with regard to its authenticity:

It is stated in the utterances of Amir al\-Mu’minin Ali \(x\) that AIt

is strange during his lifetime he \(Abu Bakr\) wanted to give up the Caliphate, but he strengthened its foundation fo the other one after his death\.\) \(Sharh Durrat al\-Ghawwas, p\. 17\)

1. Shaikh Ala ad\-Dawla as\-Simnani writes the following: “The Commander of the Faithful and the master of people of knowledge Ali \(x\)

has stated in one of his brilliant sermons: ‘This is the Shaqshaqah that burst forth’ as we read in Al\-Urway li ahl al\-khalwa wal\-jalwa, p\. 3, a manuscript at the Nasiriyya Library, Lucknow, India\.”

1. Abul\-Fadl Ahmed ibn Muhammad al\-Maydani \(d\. 518 A\.H\.\) has written in connection with the word Shaqshaqa:

One sermon of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) Ali is known as Khutbat

ash\-Shaqshaqiyya \(sermon of the camel’s foam\) \(Majma’ al\-Amthal, Vol\.

1, p 369\)\.

116al\-Tibrisi, _Al\-Ihtijaj_, p\. 101\.

<a id="page347"></a>1. In fifteen places in Al\-Nihaya, while explaining the words of this sermon, Abus\-Sa’ada, namely Mubarak ibn Muahmmed ibn al\-Athir al\-Jazri \(d\. 606 A\.H\) has acknowledged it to be Amir al\-Mu’minin’s utterance\. 2. Shaikh Muhammad Tahir Patni, while explaining the same words in Majma’ Bihar al\-Anwar, testifies that this sermon belongs to Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\), saying, “Ali \(x\) says so\. 3. Abul\-Fadl ibn Manzur \(d\. 711 A\.H\.\) has acknowledged it as Amir al\-Mu’minin’s utterance in his lexicon titled Lisan al\-\`Arab, Vol\. 12, p\. 54 by saying, “In the sayings of Ali in his sermon AIt is the camel’s foam that burst forth then subsided\. 4. Mujaddid al\-Din, namely al\-Firuz Aabadi \(d\. 816/817\) A\.H\.\) has recorded under the words Shaqshaqa in his lexicon \(Al\-Qamus, Vol\. 3, p\. 251\)

The Shaqshaqiyya sermon is by Ali \(x\); it is named so because

when Ibn Abbas asked him to resume it where he had left it, he said, “OIbn Abbas\! It was the foam of a camel that burst forth then subsided\.

25\) the compiler of Muntaha al\-Adab writes the following:

The Shaqshaqiyya of Ali is attributed to Ali \(Allah may honor his

face\)\.

1. Shaikh Muhammad \`Abdoh, themufti of Egypt, recognizing it as Amir al\-Mu’minin’s utterance, has written its explanations\.
2. Muhammad Muhyi’d\-Din \`Abdul\-Hamid, professor of Arabic at Al\-Azhar University, has written annotations on Nahjul\-Balagha, adding a Foreword in the beginning wherein he recognizes all such sermons which contain disparaging remarks to be the utterances of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)\.

In the face of these evidences and undeniable proofs is there any scope to hold that it is not Amir\-al\-Mu’minin’s production and that Sayyid ar\-Radi prepared it himself?

1. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) has referred to Abu Bakr’s accession to the caliphate metaphorically as having dressed himself with it\. This

<a id="page348"></a>was a common metaphor\. Thus, when Othman was called to give up the Caliphate, he replied, “I shall not put off this shirt which Allah has put on me\. No doubt Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) has not attributed this dressing of

Caliphate to Allah, but to Abu Bakr himself with the Caliphate\. He knew that this outfit had been stitched for this own body and his status with relationship to the Caliphate was that of the axis in the hand\-mill which cannot retain its central status without it nor be of any use\. Similarly, he held “I was the central pivot of the Caliphate, were I not the re, its entire system would have gone astray from the pivot\. It was I who acted as a guard for its organization and order and guided it through all difficulties\. Currents of learning flowed form my bosom and watered it on all sides\. My status was high beyond imagination but lust of world seekers for governance became a tumbling stone for me and I had to confine myself to seclusion\. Blinding darkness prevailed all around and there was intense gloom everywhere\. The young grew old and the old departed for the graves but this patience\-breaking period would not end\. I kept watching with my eyes the plundering of my own inheritance and saw the passing of Caliphate from one hand to the other but remained patient as I could not stop their high\-handedness for lack of means\.”

**Need for the Prophet’s Caliph and the Method of his Appointment**

After the Prophet \(h\) of Islam the presence of such a personality

was inevitable who could stop the community form disintegration and guard the religious law against change, alteration and interference by those who wanted to twist it to suit their own desires\. If this very need is denied then there is no sense in attaching so much importance to the succession of the Prophet \(h\) that the assemblage in saqifa of Banu

Sa\`idah should have been considered more important than the burial of the Prophet \(h\)\. If the need is recognized, the question is whether or not the Prophet \(h\), too, realized it\. If it is held he could not attend to it and

appreciate its need or absence of need it would be the biggest proof for regarding the Prophet’s mind to be blank for thinking of means to stop the evils of innovations and apostasy in spite of having given warning about them\. If it is said that he did realize it but had to leave it unresolved on account of some advantage, then instead of keeping it hidden, the advantage should be clearly indicated; otherwise, silence without purpose would constitute delinquency in the discharge of the obligations of Prophethood\. If there was some impediment, it should be disclosed; otherwise, we should agree that just as the Prophet \(h\) did not leave any

<a id="page349"></a>item of religion incomplete, he did not leave this matter either and did propose such a course of action for it, that if it was acted upon religion would have remained safe against the interference of others\.

The question now is that was that course of action\. If it is taken to be the consensus of opinion of the community, then it cannot truly take place as in such consensus acquiescence of every individual is necessary; but taking into account the difference in human temperaments, it seems impossible that they would agree on any single point\. Nor is there any example where on such matters there has been no single voice of dissent\. How then can such a fundamental need be made dependent on the occurrence of such an impossible even B need on which converges the future of Islam and the good of the Muslims\. Therefore, the mind is not prepared to accept this criterion\. Nor is tradition in harmony with it, as judge Adud ad\-Din al\-\`Iji has written in Sharh al\-Mawaqif: “You should know that Caliphate cannot depend upon unanimity of election because no logical or traditional argument can be advanced for it\.

In fact, when the advocates of unanimous election found that unanimity of all votes is difficult they adopted the agreement of the majority as a substitute for unanimity, ignoring the difference of the minority\. Also, in such a case, it often happens that the force of fair and foul would correct and incorrect ways turns the flow of the majority opinion in the direction where there is neither individual distinction nor personal merit as a result of which competent persons remain hidden while incompetent individuals stand forwards\. When capabilities remain so cubed and personal ends stand in the way as hurdles, how can there be expectation for the election of the correct person\. Even if it is assumed that all voters have independent, unbiased views, that no one has his own objective and that none has any other consideration, it is not necessary that every verdict of the majority should be correct and that it cannot go astray\. Experience shows that after experiment, the majority has held its own verdict to be wrong\. If every verdict of the majority is correct then its first verdict should be wrong because the verdict, which holds it wrong, is also that of the majority\. In this circumstance, if the election of the Caliph goes wrong, who would be responsible for the mistake and who should face the blame for the ruination of the Islamic polity\. Similarly on whom would be the liability for the bloodshed and slaughter following the turmoil and activity of the elections? When it has been seen that even those who sat in the audience of the Holy Prophet \(h\) could not be free

of mutual quarrel and strife, how can other avoid it?

<a id="page350"></a>If, with a view to avoid mischief, it is left to the people of authority to choose anyone they like, then here too, the same friction and conflict would prevail because here again, convergence of human temperaments on one point is not necessary nor can they be assumed to rise above personal ends\. In fact, here the chances of conflict and collision could be stronger because if not all, at least most of them would themselves, be candidates for that status and would not spare any effort to defeat their opponent, creating impediments I his way as best as possible\. Its inevitable consequence would be mutual struggle and mischief\-mongering\. Thus, it would not be possible to ward off the mischief for which this device was adopted and instead of finding a proper individual, the community would just become an instrument for the achievement of personal benefits of the others\. Again, what would be the criterion for these people in authority? The same as has usually been, namely whoever collects a few supporters and is able to create commotion in any meeting by use of forceful words would count among the people of authority\. Or would capabilities also be judged? If the mode of judging the capabilities is again this very common vote, then the same complications and conflicts would arise here too, to avoid in which this way was adopted\. If there is some other standard, then instead of judging the capabilities of the voter by it, why not judge the person who is considered suitable for the status in view\. Furthermore, how many persons in authority would be enough to give a verdict? Apparently a verdict once accepted would be precedent for good and the number that would give this verdict would become the criterion for the future\. Judge Adud ad\-Din al\-\`Iji writes the following: “Rather, the nomination of one or two individuals by the people in authority is enough because we know that the companions who were strict in religion deemed it enough as the nomination of Abu Bakr by Umar and of Othman by Abd ar\-Rahman as we read on p\. 351 of Sharh al\-Mawaqif\.

This is the account of the unanimous election in the Hall of Banu Sa\`idah and the activity of the consultative assembly; that is, one man’s action has been given the name of unanimous election and individual’s deed given the name of consultative assembly\. Abu Bakr had well understood this reality that election means the vote of the person or two only which is to be attributed to common simple people\. That is why he ignored the requirements of unanimous election, majority vote or method of choosing through electoral assembly and appointed \`Umar by nomination\. Aisha also considered that leaving the question of caliphate to the vote of a few particular individuals means inviting mischief and trouble\. She sent a word to \`Umar on his death saying:

<a id="page351"></a>Do not leave the Islamic community without a chief\. Nominate a Caliph for it and leave it not without an authority as; otherwise, I apprehend mischief and trouble\.

When the election by those in authority proved futile is was given up and only “might is right” became the criteria, namely whoever subdues others and binds them under his sway and control is accepted as the Caliph of the Prophet \(h\) and his true successor\. These are those self\-

adopted principles in the face of which all the Prophet’s saying uttered in the “Feast of the relatives,” on the night of hijra, at the battle Tabuk, on the occasion of conveying the Quranic chapter Bara’a \(Tawba, Ch\. 9\) and at Ghadir \(the swamp of\) Khumm\. The strange thing is that when each of the first three caliphates is based on one individual’s choice, how can this very right to choose be denied to the Prophet \(h\) himself, particularly

when this was the only way to end all the dissensions, namely that the Prophet \(h\) should have himself settled it and saved the community from

future disturbances and spared it from leaving this decision I the hands of people who were themselves involved in personal aims and objects\. This is the correct procedure which stands to reason and which also has the support of the Prophet’s definite sayings\.

Hayyan ibn as\- Samin al\-Hanafi of Yamama was the chief of the tribe Banu Hanifah and the commander of the fortress and the army\. Jabir is the name of his younger brother while al\-Asha whose real name was Maymun ibn Qays ibn Jandal enjoyed the status of being his bosom friend and led a decent, happy life through his bounty\. In this verse, he has compared his current life with the previous one that is the days when he roamed about in search of livelihood and those when he led a happy life in Hayyan’s company\. Generally, Amir al\-Mu’minin’s quoting of this verse has been taken to compare this troubled period with the peaceful days passed under the care and protection of the Prophet \(h\) when he

was free from all sorts of troubles and enjoyed mental peace\. But taking into account he occasion for making this comparison and the subject matter of the verse, it would not be far\-fetched if it is taken to indicate the difference between the unimportant status of those in power during the Prophet’s life time and the authority and power enjoyed by them after him\. That is, at one time in the days of the Prophet \(h\) no heed was paid

to them because of Ali’s personality but now the time had so changed that the same people were masters of the affairs of the Muslim world\.

When Umar was wounded by Abu Lulu’ah and he saw that it was difficult for him to survive because of the deep wound, he formed a

<a id="page352"></a>consultative committee and nominated Ali \(x\) ibn Abu Talib, \`Othman

ibn Affan, Abd ar\-Rahman ibn Awf, az\-Zubayr ibn al\-Awwam, Sa\`d ibn Abu Waqqas and Talhah ibn Ubaydillah\. Then, he bound them that after three days of his death, they should select one of themselves as the Caliph while for those three days Suhayb should act as Caliph\. On receipt of these instructions, some members of the committee requested him to indicate what ideas he had about each of them to enable them to proceed further in their light\. Umar, therefore, disclosed his own view about each individual\. He said that Sa\`d is harsh\-tempered and hot\- headed; \`Abd ar\-Rahman was Pharaoh of the community; as\-Zubayr was, if pleased, a true believer, but if displeased, an un\-believer; Talhah was the embodiment of pride and haughtiness and if he was made caliph, he would put the ring of the caliphate on his wife’s finger while Othman did not see beyond his kinsmen\. As regarding Ali \(x\), he is enamored of the Caliphate although I

know that he alone can run it on the right lines\. Nevertheless, despite this admission, he thought it necessary to constitute the consultative committee and in selecting its members and laying down the working procedure, he made sure that the Caliphate would take the direction in which he wished to turn it\. Thus, a man of ordinary prudence can draw the conclusion that all the factors for \`Othman’s success were present the rein\. If we look at its members, we see that one of the them, namely Abd ar\-Rahman ibn Awf is the husband of Othman’s sister, next Sa\`d ibn Abu Waqqas besides bearing malice towards Ali \(x\) is a relative and kinsman

of Abd ar \-Rahman\. Neither of them can be taken to go against \`Utham\. The third, Talhah ibn \`Ubaydullah about who Professor Muhammad Abdo writes in this annotation on Nahjul\-Balagha:

Talhah was inclined towards Othman and the reason for it was no less than that he was against Ali because he himself was an At\-Taymi’ and Abu Bakr’s accession to the caliphate had created bad blood between Banu Taym and Banu Hashim\.

As regarding az\-Zubayr, even if he had voted for Ali what could his single vote achieve\. According to al\-Tabari’s statement, Talhah was not present in Medina at that time, but his absence did not stand in the way of \`Othman’s success\. Rather, even if he were present, was reached at themeeting \(of the Committee\) and he was taken to be Ali’s supporter, still there could be no doubt in Othman’s success because Omer’s sagacious mind had set the working procedure that:

If two agree about one and the other two about another then Abdullah bin Umar should act as the arbitrator\. The group whom he

<a id="page353"></a>orders should choose the Caliph from among themselves\. If they do not accept Abdullah ibn \`Omer’s verdict, support should be given to the group which includes Abd ar\-Rahman ibn Awf, but if the others do not agree they should be beheaded for opposing this verdict\.117

Here, the disagreement with the verdict of Abdullah ibn Umar has no meaning since he was directed to support the group which included Abd ar\-Rahman ibn Awf\. He had ordered his son Abdullah and Suhayb that:

If the people differ, you should side with themajority, but if three of them are on one side and the other three on the other, you should side with the group including Abd ar\-Rahman ibn Awf as we see in al\-Tabari, Vol\. 1, pp\. 2725, 2789; Ibn al\-Athir, Vol\. 3, pp\. 51, 67\.

In this instruction, the agreement with themajority also means support of Abd ar\-Rahman because themajority could not be on any other side since fifty blood\-thirsty swords had been put on the heads of the opposition group with orders to fall on their heads on Abd ar\-Rahman’s behest\. Amir al\-Mu’minin’s eye had foreseen it at that very moment that the caliphate was going to Othman as appears from his following words which he spoke to Abbas ibn Abdul\-Muttalib: “The Caliphate has been turned away from us\.” Al\-Abbas asked how he could know it\. He replied, “\`Othman has also been coupled with me and it has been laid down that the majority should be supported; but if two agree on one and two on the other, then support should be given to the group which includes \`Abd ar\-Rahman ibn Awf\.” Now Sa\`d will support his cousin Abd ar\-Rahman who is of course, the husband of Othman’s sister according to the same reference cited above\.

However, after Omer’s death, this meeting took place in the room of Aisha and on its door stood Abu Talhah al\-Ansari with fifty men having drawn swords in their hands\. Talhad started the proceedings and inviting all others to be witness said hat he gave his right of vote to Othman\. This touched az\-Zubayr’s sense of honor as his mother, Safiyya daughter of Abdul\-Muttalib, was the sister of the Prophet’s father\. So, he gave his right of vote to Ali\. Thereafter, Sa\`d ibn Abu Waqqas made his right of vote to Abd ar\- Rahman\. This left three members of the consultative committee out of whom Abd ar\-Rahman said that he was willing to give up his own right of vote if Ali \(x\) and Othman gave him

117al\-Tabari, Vol\. 1 pp\. 2779\-80; Ibn al\-Athir, Vol\. 3, p\. 67\.

<a id="page354"></a>the right to choose one of them or one of these two should acquire this right by withdrawing\. This was a trap in which Ali had been entangled from all sides, namely that either he should abandon his own right or else allow Abd ar \-Rahman to do as he wished\. The first case was not possible for him; that is, to give up his own right and elect Othman or Abd ar\-Rahman\. So, he clung to his right, while Abd ar\-Rahman, separating himself from it, assumed this power and said to Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\), AI

pay you allegiance on your following the Book of Allah, the Sunnah \(teachings\) of the Prophet \(h\) and the conduct of the two Shaikhs \(Abu Bakr and Umar\)\. Ali \(x\) replied, “Rather on following the book of Allah, the Sunnah of the Prophet \(h\) and my own findings\. When Abd ar\-

Rahman got the same reply even after repeating the question thrice, he turned to Othman saying, “Do you accept these conditions?” \`Othman had no reason to refuse and so he agreed to the conditions and allegiance was paid to him\. When Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) saw his rights being trampled,

he said: “This is not the first day when you behaved against us\. I have only to keep good patience\. Allah is the Helper against whatever you say\. By Allah, you have not made Othman caliph but in hope that he would give back the caliphate to you\.”

After recording the events of the shura \(consultative committee\), Ibn Abul\-Hadid has written that when allegiance had been paid to Othman, Ali \(x\) addressed Othman and Abd ar\-Rahman saying, “May

Allah sow the seed of dissension among you, and so it happened that each turned a bitter enemy of the other and Abd ar\-Rahman did not ever after speak to Othman till death\. Even on his deathbed, he turned his face on him\.

On seeing these events, the question arises whether shura \(consultative committee\) means confining the matter to six persons, thereafter to three and finally to one only\. Also, whether the condition of following the conduct of the two Shaikhs \[Abu Bakr and Umar\] for caliphate was put by Umar or it was just a hurdle put by Abd ar\-Rahman between Ali \(x\) and the caliphate, although the first caliph did not put

forth this condition at the time of nominating the second caliph, namely that he should follow the former’s footsteps\. What then, was the occasion for this condition here?

However, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) had agreed to participate in it in

order to avoid mischief and to put an end to arguing so that others should be silenced and should not be able to claim that they would have voted in

<a id="page355"></a>his favor and that he, himself, evaded the consultative committee and did not give them an opportunity of selecting him\.

About the reign of the third caliph \[Othman ibn Affan\], Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) says that soon on Othman’s coming to power Banu

Umayyah got ground and began plundering the bayt al\-mal \) \(public fund\) and just as cattle on seeing green grass after a drought trampled it away, they recklessly feel upon Allah’s money and devoured it\. At last, this self\-indulgence and nepotism brought him to the stage when people besieged his house, put him to the sword and made him vomit all that he had swallowed\.

The mis\-administration that took place in this period was such that no Muslim can remain unmoved to see that companions of high status were lying without anyone to care for them, they were stricken with poverty and surrounded by bankruptcy while control over bayt al\-mal \(public fund\) was that of Banu Umayyah, government positions were occupied by their young and inexperienced persons, special Muslim properties were owned by them, meadows provided grazing but to their cattle, houses were built but by them and orchards were but for them\. If any compassionate person spoke about these excesses, his ribs were broken and if someone agitated this capitalism, he was expelled from the city\. The uses to which zakat \(poor\-rate\) and charities which were meant for the poor and the wretched and the public fund which was the common property of the Muslims were put may be observed from the following few illustrations:

1. Al\-Hakam ibn Abul\-As who had been exiled form Medina by the Prophet \(h\), was allowed back in the city, not only against the

Prophet’s Sunnah \(teachings\) but also against the conduct of the first two Caliphs\. He was paid three hundred thousand dirhams form the public fund\. \(Ansab al\-Ashraf, Vol\. 5, pp\. 27, 28, 125\)

1. Al\-Walid ibn Uqbah, who has been naed hypocrite in the Holy Quran, was piad one hundred thousand Dirhams from the Muslims’ public fund \(Al\-Iqd al\-Farid, Vol\. 3, p\. 94\)\.
2. The caliph married his own daughter, Umm Aban, to Marwan ibn al\-Hakam and paid him one hundred thousand dirhams for the public fund \(Sharh of Iban Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 1, pp\. 198\-199\)\.
3. He married his daughter Aisha to Harith ibn al\-Hakam and granted him one hundred thousand dirhams for the public fund \(Ibid\.\)\.

<a id="page356"></a>1. Abdullah ibn Khalid was paid four hundred dirhams as we read on p\. 84 of Al\-Ma’arif of Ibn Qutaybah\. 2. He allowed the khums \(one\-fifth religious tax\) from Africa \(amounting\) to five hundred thousand dnars to Marwan ibn al\-Hakam, according to the same reference\. 3. Fadak, which was withheld from the angelic daughter of the Prophet \(h\) on the ground of being general charity, was given as a royal favor to Marwan ibn al\-Hakam\. See the same reference cited above\. 4. Mahzur, a place in the commercial area of Medina which had been declared, “public trust by the Prophet \(h\), was gifted to Harith ibn al\-Hakam, according to the same reference\. 5. In the meadows around Medina, no camel except those of Banu Umayyah were allowed to graze, as we read in the Sharh of Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 1, p\. 199\. 6. After his Othman’s death, one hundred and fifty thousand dinars \(gold coins\) and one million Dirhams \(silver coins\) were found in his house\. There was no limit to tax\-free lands and the total value of the land estate he owned in Wadi al\-Qura and Hunain was one hundred thousand dinars\. There were countless camels and horses\. according to Muruj al\-Dhahab, Vol\. 1, p\.435\. 7. the Caliph’s relatives ruled all the principal cities\. Thus, at Kufa, al\-Walid ibn \`Uqbah was the governor, but when in the state of intoxication of wine, he led the morning prayer in four instead of two rak’ah\. People were agitated and demanded his removal, but the Caliph put in his place a hypocrite like Sa’id ibn al\-As\. In Egypt, \`Abdullah ibn Sa\`d ibn Abu Sarh, in Syria Mu\`awiyah ibn Abu Sufyan and in Basra, Abdullah ibn Amir were the governors appointed by him \(ibid\)\.

**Amir Al\-Mu’minin’s Far\-Sightedness and Staunch Conviction**

<a id="page357"></a>Through us you got guidance in the darkness and secured a high status\. And through us you got out of the gloomy night\. The ears which do not listen to the cries may become deaf\. How can one who remained deaf to the loud cries \(of the Holy Quran and the Prophet \[h\]\) listen to

\(my\) feeble voice\. The heart that has ever palpitated \(with fear of Allah\) may get peace\.

I always apprehended from you consequences of treachery and I had seen you through in the garb of the deceitful\. The curtain of the religion had kept me hidden from you but the truth of my intentions disclosed you to me\. I stood for you on the path of truth among misleading tracks were you met each other, but there was no leader and you dug but got no water\.

Today, I am making these dumb things peak to you \(i\.e\. my suggestive ideas and deep musing, etc\.\) which are full of descriptive power\. The opinion of the person who abandons me may get astray\. I have never doubted the truth since it was shown to me\. Musa \(Moses\)118 did not entertain fear for his own self\. Rather, he feared the mastery of the ignorant and the path towards deviation\. Nowadays, we stand on the crossroads of truth and falsehood\. The one who is sure of getting water feels no thirst\.

Amir al\-Mu’minin says that the ground for Moses’ fear was not that since he saw ropes and sticks moving he might have entertained fear for his life, but the cause of his fear was lest people be impressed with this sorcery and get astray and untruth might prevail on account of this craft\. That is why Moses was not consoled by saying that his life was safe but by saying that he would prove superior and his claim would be upheld\. Since his fear was for the defeat of the truth and victory of falsehood, not for his own life, the consideration was given to him for the victory of truth and not for the protection of his life\.

Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) also means that he too, had the same fear meaning that the people should not be caught in the trap of these \(Talhah,

118The reference refers to Moses when sorcerers were sent for to confront him and they demonstrated their sorcery by throwing ropes and sticks on the ground and Moses felt afraid\. Thus, the Holy Quran records: “It seemed to him \(Moses\), by their sorcery as if they were running\. Then Moses felt in himself a fear\. We said: Fear not\! Verily, you are the uppermost \(20: 66\-68\)\.

<a id="page358"></a>az\-Zubayr, etc\.\) and fall into misguidance by getting astray from the true faith\. otherwise, he himself never feared for his own life\.

**Delivered when the Holy Prophet \(h\) died and Abbas ibn Abdul\-Muttalib and Abu Sufyan ibn Harb offered to swear allegiance to Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) as the Caliph**

O People\!119

Steer clear through the waves of mischief by boats of deliverance, turn away from the path of dissension and put off the gowns of pride\. Prosperous is one who rises with wings \(i\.e\. when he has power\) or else he remains peaceful and others enjoy ease\. It \(i\.e\. The aspiration for Caliphate\) is like turbid water or like a morsel that would suffocate the

119When the Holy Prophet \(h\) died, Abu Sufyan was not in Medina\. He

was coming back when on his way he got the news of this tragedy\. At once, he inquired who had become the leader the chief\. He was told that people had paid allegiance to Abu Bakr\. On hearing this, the acknowledged mischief\-monger of Arabia went into deep thought and eventually went to Abbas ibn Abdul\-Muttalib with a proposal\. He said to him, “Look\! These people have by contrivance handed over the Caliphate to the Taym and deprived Banu Hashim of it for good\. And, after himself, this man will place over our heads a haughty man from Banu Adiy\. Let us go to Ali bin Abu Talib \(x\) and ask him to get out of his house and take arms

to secure his right\.” So, taking Abbas with him, he went to Ali \(x\) and said: “Give

me your hand\. I pledge allegiance to you, and if anyone rises in opposition, I will fill the streets of Medina with men of cavalry and infantry\.” This was the most delicate moment for Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)\. He regarded himself as the true master

and successor of the Prophet \(h\), while a man with the backing of a tribe such as

that of Abu Sufyan was ready to support him\. Just a signal was enough to ignite the flames of war\. But Amir al\-Mu’minin’s foresight and right judgment saved the Muslims from civil war as his piercing eyes perceived that this man wanted to start a civil war by rousing the passions of tribal partisanship and distinction of birth so that Islam would be struck with a convulsion that would shake it to its roots\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\), therefore, rejected his counsel and admonished him several and

spoke forth the words, whereby he had stopped people form mischief\-mongering and undue conceit\. He declared his stand to be, for him, there were only two coursesCeither take up arms or sit quietly at home\. If he rose for war, there were no supporters so that he could suppress the rising insurgence\. The only course left was to quietly wait for the opportunity until circumstances were favorable\.

<a id="page359"></a>person who swallows it\. One who plucks fruits before ripening is like one who cultivated in another’s field\.

If I speak out they would call me greedy towards power, but if I keep quiet they would say I was afraid of death\. It is a pity that after all the ups and downs \(I have been through\)\. By Allah, the son of Abu Talib120 is more familiar with death than an infant with the breast of its mother\. I have hidden knowledge; if I disclose it you will start trembling like ropes in deep wells\.

Amir al\-Mu’minin’s calm at this stage was indicative of his high policy and far\-sightedness because if in those circumstances Medina had become the center of war, its fire would have engulfed the whole of Arabia in its flames\. The discord and scuffle that had already begun among the Muhajirun and the ansar would have increased to maximum, the wire\-pulling of the hypocrites would have had full play and Islam’s ship would have been caught in such a whirlpool that its balancing would have been difficult\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) suffered trouble and

tribulations, but did not raise his hands\. History is witness that during his life at Mecca, the Prophet \(h\) suffered all sorts of troubles but he was not

prepared to clash or struggle by abandoning patience and endurance because he realized that if war took place at that stage the way for Islam’s growth and fruition would be closed\. Of course, when he had collected supporters and helpers enough to suppress the flood of unbelief and curb

120About the death, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) says that it is so dear to him that

even an infant does not so love to leap towards the source of its nourishment while in its mother’s lap\. An infant’s attachment with the breast of its mother is under the effect of a natural impulse, but the dictates of natural impulses change with the advance of age\. When the limited period of infancy ends and the infant’s temperament changes, he does not like to even look at what was so familiar to him but rather turns his face from it in disgust\. But, the love of prophets and saints for union with Allah is mental and spiritual and mental and spiritual feelings do not change, nor does weakness or decay occur in them\. Since death is the means and first rung toward this goal, their love for death increases to such an extent that its rigors become the cause of pleasure for them and its bitterness proves to be the source of delight for their taste\. Their love for it is the same as that of the thirsty for the well or that of a lost passenger for his goal\. Thus, when Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)

was wounded by Abd ar\-Rahman ibn Muljim’s fatal attack, he said, “I was but like the walker who has reached \(the goal\) or like the seeker who has found \(his object\) and whatever is with Allah is good for the pious\. The Prophet \(h\) also said that there is no pleasure for a believer other than union with Allah\.

<a id="page360"></a>the disturbances, he rose to face the enemy\. Similarly, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\), treating the life of the Prophet \(h\) as a torch for his guidance,

refrained from exhibiting the power of his arm because he was realizing that rising against the enemy without helpers and supporter would become a source of rebellion and defeat instead of success and victory\. Therefore, on this occasion, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) has likened the desire for

Caliphate to turbid water or a morsel suffocating the throat\. Thus, even where people had forcibly snatched this morsel and wanted to swallow it by forcible thrusting, it got stuck in their throat\. They could neither swallow it nor vomit it out\. That is, they could neither manage it as is apparent from the blunders they committed in connection with Islamic injunctions, nor were they ready to cast off the knot from their neck\.

He reiterated the same ideas in different words thus; “Had I attempted to pluck the unripe fruit of Caliphate, then by this the orchard would have been desolated and I, too, would have achieved nothing, like these people who cultivate on other’s land but can neither guard it, nor water it at the proper time, nor reap any crop from it\. The status of these people is that if I ask them to vacate it so that the owner should cultivate it himself and protect it, they say how greedy I am, while if I keep quiet they think I am afraid of death\. They should tell me on what occasion did I ever feel afraid, or flew from a battlefield for my life, whereas every small or big encounter is proof of my bravery and a witness to may daring and courage\. He who plays with swords and strikes against hillocks is not afraid of death\. I am so familiar with death that even an infant is not so familiar with the breast of its mother\. Hark\! The reason for my silence is the knowledge that the Prophet \(h\) has put in my bosom\. If I divulge it

you would get perplexed and bewildered\. Let some days pass and you would know the reason of my inaction and perceive with your own eyes what sort of people would appear on this scene under the name of Islam and what destruction they would bring about\. My silence is because this would happen, otherwise, it is not silence without reason\.”

A Persian axiom says the following: “Silence has a meaning which cannot be couched in words\.”

121When Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) showed intention to chase Talhah and az\-Zubayr, he was advised to leave them on their own lest he received some harm from them\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) uttered these words in reply, the sum total

whereof is: “How long can I be mere spectator to my right being snatched and keep quiet\. Now, so long as I have the breath of life, I shall fight them and make them suffer the consequences of their conduct\. They should not think that I can be easy over \-powered like the badger\. Its nicknames are: “Umm Amir” and “Umm Tariq”\. It is also called “the glutton” because it swallows everything and eats up whatever it gets as if several bellies were contained in one and it does not have its fill\. It is also called Na\`thal\. It is a very simply and silly animal\. Its slyness is apparent from the way it is easily caught\. It is said that the hunter surrounds its den and strikes it with his foot or a stick and calls out softly, ABow your head, Umm Tariq, conceal yourself, Umm Amir\. On repeating this sentence, while patting the ground, it conceals itself in a corner of the den\. Then, the hunter says, “Umm Amir is not in its den; it is sleeping\.” On hearing this, it stretches its limbs and pretends it is asleep\. The hunter then puts the knot in its feet and drags it out and it falls like a coward into his hand without resistance\.

122Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) says about the hypocrites \(i\.e\. Those who opposed him

before the during his Caliphate\) that they are partners in action of Satan and his helpers and supporters\. He too, has befriended them so much that he has made his abode with them, resides on their bosoms, lays eggs and hatches young one from

<a id="page362"></a>bosoms\. He creeps and crawls in their laps\. He sees through their eyes and speaks with their tongues\. In this way, he has led them to sinfulness and adorned for them foul things like the action of one whom Satan has made partner in his domain and speaks untruth through his tongue\.

He asserts that he swore allegiance to me with his hand, but did not swear with his heart\.123

So he does admit allegiance\. In regards to his claiming it with his heart he should come forward with a clear argument for it\. otherwise, he should return to wherefrom he has gone out\.124

them the re, while these young ones jump and play in their laps without demur\. He means that Satanic evil ideas take birth in their bosoms and grow and thrive the re\. There is no restrain on them, nor restriction of any kind\. He has permeated their blood and mingled their spirit so that both have become completely unified\. Now, the eyes are theirs but the sight is his, the tongue is theirs but he words are his and the Prophet \(h\) has said, “Verily, Stan permeates the progeny of Adam like blood\.

That is, just as the circulation of blood does not stop, the same way, the quick succession of Satan’s evil ideas knows no break and he draws man toward evil in sleep in wakefulness and in every posture, rising or sitting\. He so paints them with his dye that their word and action reflect an exact portrait of his word and action\. Those whose bosoms shine with the glory of faith prevent such evil ideas but some are already ready to welcome those evils and these are the persons who, under the garb of Islam, are after the advancement of heresy\.

123After swearing allegiance on the hand of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\), az\-

Zubayr ibn al\-Awwam broke the allegiance\. Then sometimes he put forth the excuse that he was forced to swear allegiance and that forced allegiance is no allegiance and sometimes, he said that allegiance was only for show\. His heart did not go in accord to it\. As though he himself admitted with his tongue the duplicity of his outer appearance and inner self\. But this excuse is like that of the one who reverts to apostasy after adopting Islam and to avoid penalty may say that he had accepted Islam only by the tongue, not in the heart\. Obviously, such an excuse cannot be heard nor can avoid punishment\. If az\-Zubayr suspected that Othman was slain at insistence of Amir al\-Mu’minin, this suspicion should have existed when he was taking the oath for obedience and stretching his hand for allegiance, not now that his expectations were getting frustrated and hopes had started dawning from somewhere else\.

**About Talhah and az\-Zubayr 126**

Beware\! Satan has collected his group and assembled his horsemen and foot soldiers\. Surely, with me is my sagacity\. I have neither deceived myself nor ever been deceived\. By Allah, I shall fill to the brim

124Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) has rejected his claim in short form\. Thus, when

he admits that his hands had paid allegiance then until there is justification for breaking of the allegiance he should stick to it\. But, if, according to him his heart was not in accord with it, he should produce other proof for it\. Since proof about the state of heart cannot be adduced how can he bring such proof and an assertion without proof is unacceptable to his mind\.

125About the people of Jamal \(i\.e\. The enemy in the Battle of Jamal\) Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) says that they rose thundering, shouting and stampeding but when

encounter took place they were seen flying like straw\. At one time, they made loud claims that they would do this and that and now they showed such cowardice as to flee from the battlefield\. About himself, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) says, “We do not

threaten the enemy before battle, nor utter boasts, nor terrorize the enemy by raising unnecessary cries because it is not the way of the brave to use the tongue instead of the hand\. That is why on this occasion, he said to his comrades, “Beware of excessive talk as it is cowardice\.”

126When Talhah and az\-Zubayr broke away by violating the oath of allegiance and set for Basra in the company of Aisha, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) spoke

in these words which are part of the long speech\. Ibn Abul\-Hadid has written that in this sermon Satan denotes the real Satan as well as Mu\`awiyah because Mu\`awiyah was secretly conspiring the Talhah and az\-Zubayr and instigating them to fight against Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\); but the reference to the real Satan is more appropriate, obvious and in accord with the situation and circumstances\.

<a id="page364"></a>for them a cistern from which I alone would draw water\. They can neither turn away from it nor return to it\.

**Sermon 11**

**Delivered during the Battle of Jamal when Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) gave the standard to his son Muhammad ibn al\-Hanafiyya**

Mountains 2 may move from their status, but you should not move from yours\. Grit your teeth\. Lend to Allah your head \(in fighting for Allah, give yourself to Allah\)\. Plant your feet firmly on the ground\. Have your eye on the remotest foe and close your eyes \(to their numberical majority\)\. And be sure that succor is but from Allah, the Glorified\.

Muhammad ibn al \-Hanafiyya was Amir al\-Mu’minin’s son but called Ibn Hanafiyya after his mother\. His mother’s name was Khawla daughter of Ja\`far\. She was known as Hanafiyya after her tribe Banu Hanifah\. When people of Yamama were declared, “postates for refusing to pay zakat \(religious tax\) and were killed and the women were brought to Medina as slave girls, this lady also came to Medina with them\. When her tribesmen came to know it they approached Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)

and requested him to save her from the blemish of slavery and protect her family honor and prestige\. Consequently, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) purchased her, set her free and married her where after, Muhammad \(h\) was born\.

Most historians have written his surname as Abul\-Qasim\. Thus, the author of Al\-Isti’ab \(Vol\. 3\. pp\. 1366\-1368, 1370\- 1372\) has narrated the opinion of Abu Rashd ibn Hafs az\-Zuhri that from among the sons of the companions \(of the Prophet \[h\]\) he came across four individuals

everyone of whom was named Muhammad and surnamed Abul\-Qasim, namely \(1\) Muhammad ibn al\-Hanafiyya, \(2\) Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr

1. Muhammad ibn Talhah and \(4\) Muhammad ibn Sa\`d\. After this he writes that Muhammad ibn Talhah’s name and surname were given by the Prophet \(h\)\. Al\-Waqidi writes that the name of surname of Muhammad

ibn Abu Bakr was suggested by Aisha\. Apparently the Holy Prophet’s giving the name of Muhammad ibn Talhah seems incorrect since from some traditions it appears that the Prophet \(h\) had reserved it for a son of

Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) and he was Muhammad ibn al\-Hanafiyya\.

<a id="page365"></a>As regarding his surname it is said that the Prophet \(h\) had

particularized it and that he had told Ali that a son would be born to you after me and I have given him my name and surname and after that it is not permissible for anyone in my people to have this name and surname together\.

With this opinion before us, how can it be correct that the Prophet \(h\) had given this very name and surname to anyone else since

particularization means that no one else would share it\. Moreover, some people have recorded the surname of Ibn Talhah as Abu Sulayman instead of Abul\- Qasim and this further confirms our viewpoint\. Similarly, if the surname of Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr was on the ground that his son’s name was Qasim, who was among the theologians of Medians, then what is the sense in Aisha having suggested it\. If she had suggested it along with the name, how could Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr tolerate it later on since having been brought up under the care of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) the

Prophet’s saying could not remain concealed form him\. Moreover, most people have recorded his surname as Abu Abd ar\-Rahman, which weakens the view of Abu Rashid\.

Let alone these people’s surname being Abul\- Qoim, even for ibn al\-Hanafiyya this surname is not proved\. Although ibn Khallikan \(in Wafiyyat al\-A’yan, Vol\. 4, p\. 170\) has taken that some of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) for whom the Prophet \(h\) had particularized this surname

to be Muhammad ibn al\-Hanafiyya, yet allama al\-Mamaqani \(in Tanqih al\-Maqal, Vol\. 3, Part 1, p\. 112\) writes the following:

In applying this tradition to Muhammad ibn al\-Hanafiyya, Ibn Khallikan has got into confusion because the son of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) whom the Prophet’s name and surname together have been gifted by

the Prophet \(h\) and which is not permissible to be given to any one else,

is to the awaited last Imam \(may our lives be his ransom\) and not to Muhammad ibn al\-Hanafiyya, nor is the surname Abul\-Qasim established for him, rather some of the Sunnis being ignorant of the real intention of the Prophet \(h\), have taken to mean Ibn al\-Hanafiyya\.

However, Muhammad ibn al\-Hanafiyya was prominent in righteousness and piety, sublime in renunciation and worship, lofty in knowledge and achievements and heir of his father in bravery\. His performance in the Battle of Jamal and Siffin had created such impression among the Arabs that even warriors of consequence trembled at this

<a id="page366"></a>name\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) too was proud of his courage and valor and

always placed him forward in encounters\. Shaikh al \-Baha’i has written in al\-Kashkul that Ali ibn Abu Talib kept him abreast in the battles and did not allow Hassan and Hussain to go ahead and used to say, “He is my son while these two are sons of the Prophet of Allah \(k\)\. When a Kharijite said to ibn al\-Hanafiyya that Ali thrust him into the flames of war but saved away Hassan and Hussain \(x\), he replied that he himself was like

the right hand and Hassan and Hussain \(x\) like Ali’s two eyes and that Ali

protected his eyes with his right hand\. But Allama al\-Mamaqani has written in Tanqih al\-Maqal that his was not the reply of Ibn al\-Hanafiyya, but of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) himself\. When during the battle of Siffin

Muhammad mentioned this matter to Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) in a

complaining tone, he replied, “You are my right hand whereas they are my eyes and the hand should protect the eyes\.

Apparently it seems that first Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) must have

given this reply and thereafter someone might have mentioned it to Muhammad ibn al\-Hanafiyya and he must have repeated the same reply as there could not be a more eloquent reply than this one and its eloquence confirms the view that it was originally the outcome of the eloquent tongue of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) and was later appropriated by

Muhammad \(h\) al\-Hanafiyya\. Consequently, both these views can be

held to be correct and there is no incongruity between them\. However, he was bo5rn in the reign of the second Caliph and died in the reign of Abdul\-Malik ibn Marwan at the age of sixty\-five years\. Some writers have recorded the year of his death as 80 A\.H\. And others as 81 A\.H\. There is a difference about the place of his death as well\. Some have put it as Medina, some Aylah and some Ta’if\.

2\. When in the Battle of Jamal Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) sent

Muhammad ibn al\-Hanafiyya to the battle field, he told him that he should fix himself before the enemy like the mountain of determination and resolution so that the onslaught of the army should not be able to displace him and he should charge the enemy with closed teeth because by pressing the teeth over the teeth, tension occurs in the nerves of the skull\. As a result of which the stroke of the sword goes amiss as he said at another place, “Press together your teeth\. It sends amiss the edge of the sword\.” Then he says, “My child, lend your head to Allih in order that you may be able to achieve eternal life in place of this one because for a lent article there is the right to get it back\. Therefore, you should fight

<a id="page367"></a>being heedless of your life; otherwise, also if your mind clings to life, you will hesitate to advance toward deathly encounters and that would fall upon your reputation of bravery\. Look, do not let your steps falter because the enemy is emboldened at the faltering of steps and faltering steps fastens the feet of the enemy\. Keep the last lines of the enemy as your aim so that the enemy may be overawed with loftiness of your intentions and you may feel ease in tearing through their lives and their movement should also not remain concealed form you\. Look, do not pay heed to their superiority in numbers, otherwise, your valor and courage would suffer\.” This statement can also mean that one should open the eyes wide to be dazzled by the shining of weapons and the enemy may make at attack by taking advantage of the situation\. Also, always bear in mind that victory is from Allah\. “If Allah helps you, no one can overpower you\.” Therefore, instead of relying on material means, seek His support and succor\.

Remember O Believers\! If Allah helps you, none shall overcome you \(Holy Quran, 3: 159\)\.

**Sermon 12**

When Allah gave Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) victory over the enemy

at the Battle of Jamal one of his comrades said on that occasion, AI wish my brother so\-and\-so had been present so that he, too, would have seen what success and victory Allah had given you\. It was then that Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) asked him, “Did you brother hold me as a friend?” The

comrade said, “Yes\.” Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) said, “In that case, he was

with us\. Rather, in this army of ours, even those persons were also present who are still in the loins of men and in the wombs of women\. Shortly, time will bring them out and faith will get strength through them\.”

If a person falls short in his actions, despite might and means, this would be indicative of the weakness of his will\. But if there is an impediment in the way of action or his life comes to an end as a result of which his action remains incomplete, then in that case Allah would not deprive him of the reward on the basis that actions are judged by intention\. Since his intention in any case was to perform the action, therefore, he should deserve reward to some extent\.

In the case of action, there may be absence of reward because action can involve show or pretense but intention is hidden in the depth of the heart\. It can have not a jot of show or affectation\. The intention would remain at the same level of frankness, truth, perfection and correctness

<a id="page368"></a>where it is, even though there may be no action due to some impediment\. Even if there is no occasion for forming intention but there is passion and zeal in the heart, a man would deserve reward on the basis of his heart’s feelings\. This is to what Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) has alluded to in this

sermon, namely that “If your brother loved me, he would share the reward with those who secured martyrdom for our support\.”

**Sermon 13**

**Condemning the People of Basra**

You were the army of a woman and in the command of a quadruped\. When it grumbled you responded and when it was wounded \(hamstrung\) you fled away\. Your character is low and your pledge is broken\. Your faith is hypocrisy\. Your water is brackish\. He who stays with you is laden with sins and he who forsakes you secures Allah’s mercy\. As though I see your mosque prominent, resembling the surface of a boat, while Allah has sent chastisement from above and from below it and everyone who is on it is drowned\.

**Another version of the same sermon:**

By Allah\! Your city would certainly be drowned so much so that as though I see its mosque like the upper part of a boat or a sitting ostrich \(or, in another version of his statement\) like the bosom of a bird in the deep sea\.

**Yet Another Version States the Following:**

Your city is the most stinking of all the cities as regarding its clay, the nearest to water and remotest from the sky\. It contains nine tenths of evil\. He who enters it is surrounded with his sins and he who is out of it enjoys Allah’s forgiveness\. It seems as though I look at this habitation of yours that water has so engulfed it that nothing can be seen of it except the highest part of the mosque appearing like the bosom of a bird in the deep sea\.

Ibn Maytham writes that when the Battle of Jamal ended, three days thereafter, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) said the morning prayer in the

central mosque of Basra\. After finished it he stood on the right side of the prayer place reclining against the wall and delivered this sermon wherein he described the lowness of character of the people of Basra and they

<a id="page369"></a>slyness, namely that they got inflamed at others’ instigation without anyone of their own and making over their command to a woman clung to a camel\. They broke away after swearing allegiance and exhibited their low character and evil nature by being double\-faced\. In this sermon, the woman implies Aisha and the quadruped implies the camel \(Jamal\) after which this battle has been named the Battle of the Jamal\. This battle originated in this way\. During the lifetime of Othman, Aisha used to oppose him and had left for Mecca leaving him in siege and as such, she had a share in his assassination details of which would be stated at some suitable place but when on her return from Mecca toward Medina, she heard from Abdullah ibn Salamah that Othman’s allegiance had been paid to Ali \(as Caliph\) she suddenly exclaimed, “If allegiance has been paid to Ali, I wish the sky had burst on the earth\. Let me go back to Mecca\.” Consequently, she decided to return to Mecca and began saying, “By Allah, Othman has been helplessly killed\. I shall certainly avenge his blood\.” On seeing this wide change in the state of affairs, Abu Salamah said, “What are you saying as you yourself used to say ‘Kill this Na’thal; he had turned unbeliever’\.” Thereupon, she replied, “Not only I but everyone used to say so; but leave these things and listen to what I am now saying, that is better and deserves more attention\. It is so strange that first he was called upon to repent but before giving him an opportunity to do so, he has been killed\.” On this Abu Salamah recited the following verses addressing her:

You started it and now you are changing and raising storms of wind and rain\. You ordered for his killing and told us that he had turned unbeliever\. We admit that he has been killed but under your orders and the real killer is the one who ordered it\. Nevertheless, neither the sky fell over us not did the sun and moon fall into eclipse\. Certainly people have paid allegiance to one who can ward off the enemy with power and grandeur, does not allow swords to come near him and loosens the twist of the rope, that is, subdues his enemy\. He is always fully armed for combat and the faithful is never like the traitor\.

However, when she reached Mecca with a passion for vengeance she began rousing the people to avenge Othman’s blood by circulating stories of his having been victimized\. The first to respond to this call was Abdullah ibn Amir al\-Hadrami, who had been the governor of Mecca in Othman’s reign and with him Marwan ibn al\-Hakam, Sa’id ibn al\-As and other Umayyads rose to support her\. On the other side, Talhah ibn Ubaydillah and az\-Zubayr ibn al\-Awwam also reached Mecca from Medina\. From Yemen Ya\`li ibn Munabbih who had been governor there during Othman’s caliphate and the former governor of Basra, Abdullah

<a id="page370"></a>ibn Amir ibn Kurayz also reached there and joining together began preparing their plans\. The battle had been decided upon but the discussion was about he venue of confrontation\. Aisha’s opinion was to make Medina the venue of the battle but some people opposed and held that it was difficult to deal with Medinites and that some other place should be chose as the venue\. At last after much discussion it was decided to march towards Basra as there was no dearth of men to support the cause\. Consequently on the strength of Abdullah ibn Amir’s countless wealth and the offer of six hundred thousand Dirhams and six hundred camels by Ya\`li ibn Munabbih they prepared any army of three thousand and set off to Basra\. There was a small incident on the way of account of which Aisha refused to advance further\. What happened was that at a place she heard the barking of dogs and inquired from the camel driver the name of the place\. He said it was Haw’ab\. On hearing this name, she recalled the Prophet’s admonition when he ha said to his wives, AI wish I could know at which of you the dogs of Haw’ab would bark\. So when she realized that she herself was the one, she got the camel seated by patting and expressed her intention to abandon themarch\. But the device of her companions saved the deteriorating situation\. Abdullah ibn az\-Zubayr swore to assure her that it was not Haw’ab, Talhah seconded him and for her further assurance, also sent for fifty persons to testify to it\. When all of the people were on one side, what could a single woman do by opposing\. Eventually they were successful and Aisha resumed her forward march with the same enthusiasm\.

When this army reached Basra, people were first amazed to see the riding animal of Aisha\. Jariyah ibn Qudamah came forward and said, “O, Mother of the faithful, the assassination of \`Othman was one tragedy but the greater tragedy is that you have come out on this cursed camel and ruined your honor and esteem\. It is better that you should get back\. But since neither the incident at Haw’ab could deter her nor could the Quranic injunction: “Keep sitting in your houses \(33: 33\) stop her,” what effect could these voices produce\. Consequently, she disregarded all of this\.

When the army tried to enter the city, the governor of Basra Othman ibn Hunayf came forward to stop them and when the two parties came face\-to\-face, they drew their swords out of the sheaths and pounced upon each other\. When a good number had been killed from either side, Aisha intervened on the basis of her influence and the two groups agreed that until the arrival of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\), the existing administration

should continue and Othman ibn Hunayf should continue on his post\. But only two days had elapsed when they made a nightly attack on Othman ibn Hunayf, killed forty innocent persons, beat Othman ibn Hunayf,

<a id="page371"></a>plucked every hair of his bread, took him in their custody and shut him u, p\. Then they attacked the public treasury and while ransacking it, killed twenty persons on the spot and beheaded fifty more after arresting them\. Then they attacked the grain store whereupon an elderly noble of Basra, Hukaym ibn Jabalah, could not control himself and reaching there with his men said to Abdullah ibn az\-Zubayr, ASpare some of this grain for the city’s populace\. After all there should be a limit to oppression\. You have spread killing and destruction all around and put Othman ibn Hunayf in confinement\. For Allah’s sake, keep off these ruining activities and release Othman ibn Hunayf\. Is there no fear of Allah in your hearts? ibn az\-Zubayr said, “This is vengeance of Othman’s life\. Hukaym ibn Jabalah retorted, AWere those who have been killed assassins of Othman? By Allah, if I had supporters and comrades I should have certainly avenged the blood of these Muslims whom you have killed without reason\. Ibn az\-Zubayr replied, “We shall not give anything out of this grain, nor will Othman ibn Hunayf be released\. At last, the battle raged between these two parties but how could a few individuals deal with such a big force? the result was the Hukaym ibn Jabalah, his son al\-Ashraf ibn Hukaym ibn Jabalah, his brother ar\-Ri’l ibn Jabalah and seventy persons of his tribe were killed\. In short, killing and looting prevailed all around\. Neither anyone’s life was secure nor was there any way to save one’ honor or property\.

When Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) was informed of themarch to Basra,

he set out to stop it with a force which consisted of seventy of those who had taken part in the battle of Badr and four hundred out of those companions who had the honor of being present at the Allegiance of Ridwan \(The Divine Pleasure\)\. When he stopped at the stage of Khaqar, he sent his son Hassan \(x\) and “\`Ammar ibn Yasir to Kufa to invite its

people to fighting\.” Consequently, despite interference of Abu Musa al\-Ash\`ari seven thousand combatants from there joined Amir al\-Mu’minin’s army\. He left that place after placing the army under various commanders\. Eye witnesses state that when his force reached near Basra first of all a contingent of Ansar appeared foremost\. Its standard was held by Abu Ayyub al\-Ansari\. After it appeared, another contingent of 1,000 whose commander was Khuzaymah ibn Thabit al\-Ansari\. Then another contingent came in sight\. Its standard was borne by Abu Qatadah ibn ar\-Rabi’\. Then a crowd of a thousand old and young persons was seen\. They had signs of prostration on their foreheads and veils of fear of Allah on their face\. It seemed as if they were standing before the Divine Glory of the Day of Judgment\. Their commander rode a dark horse, was dressed in white, had a black turban on his head and was reciting the Holy Quran

<a id="page372"></a>loudly\. This was \`Ammar ibn Yasir\. Then another contingent appeared\. Its standard was in the hand of Qays ibn Sa\`d ibn Abadah\. Then an army came to sight\. Its leader wore white outfit and hade a black turban on this head\. He was so handsome that all eyes centered around him\. This was Abdullah ibn Abbas\. Then followed a contingent of the companions of the Prophet \(h\)\. Their standard bearer was Othman ibn Abbas\. Then after

the passing of a few contingents, a big crowd was seen wherein there was such a large number of spears that they were overlapping and flags of numerous colors were flying\. Among them, a big and lofty standard was seen with a distinctive status\. Behind it was seen a rider guarded by sublimity and greatness\. His sinews were well\-developed and his eyes were cast downwards\. His awe and dignity was such that no one could look at him\. This was the ever victorious Lion of Allah namely Ali, Ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\. On his right and left were Hassan and Hussain \(peace be

upon them\)\. In front of him Muhammad ibn al\-Hanafiyya walked in slow steps carrying the banner of victory and glory and on the back were young men of Banu Hashim, the people of Badr and \`Abdullah ibn Ja\`far ibn Abu Talib\. When this army reached the place az\-Zawiyah, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) alighted from the horse\. After performing a four rak’at

prayer, he put his cheeks on the ground\. When he lifted his head, the ground was drenched with tears and his tongue was uttering these words:

O Sustainer of earth, heaven and the high firmament\! This is Basra\. Fill our lap with its good and protect us from its evil\.

Then proceeding forward he got down in the battlefield of Jamal where the enemy was already camping\. First of all, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)

announced in his army that no one should attack another nor take the initiative\. Saying this he came in front of the opposite army and said to Talhah and az\-Zubayr, “You ask Aisha by swearing in the name of Allah and His Prophet \(h\) whether I am not free from the blame of Othman’s

blood and whether I used the same words for him which you used to say and whether I pressed you for allegiance or you swore it of your own free will\.” Talhah got exasperated at these words but az\-Zubayr relented\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) turned back after it and giving the Holy Quran to Muslim

\(a young man from the tribe of Abd Qays sent him toward them to pronounce to them the verdict of the Holy Quran\. But people took both of them within aim and covered this godly man with their arrows\. Then Ammar ibn Yasir went to canvass and convince them and caution them with the consequences of war but his words were also replied by arrows\.

<a id="page373"></a>Until now, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) had not allowed an attack as a result of

which the enemy continued feeling encouraged and went on raining arrows constantly\. At last, with the dying of a few valiant combatants consternation was created among Amir al\- Mu’minin’s ranks and some people came with a few bodies before him and said, “O Commander of the Faithful\! You are not allowing us to fight while they are covering us with arrows\. How long can we let them make our bosoms the victim of their arrows and remain hand folded at their excesses? At this, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) did show anger but acting with restraint and endurance

came to the enemy in that very form without wearing armor or any arm and shouted, “Where is az\-Zubayr?\!” At first az\-Zubayr hesitated to come forward but he noticed that Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) had no arms so he

came out\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) said to him “O az\-Zubayr\! You must remember that one day the Prophet \(h\) told you that you would fight with me and wrong and excess would be on your side\.” Az\-Zubayr replied that he had said so\. Then Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) inquired AWhy

have you come then?” He replied that his memory had missed it and if he had recollected it earlier he would not have come that way\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) said, “Well now you have recollected it” and he replied,

“Yes\.” Saying this he went straight to Aisha and told her that he was leaving\. She asked him the reason and he replied, “Ali has reminded me a forgotten matter\. I had gone astray, but now I have come on the right path and would not fight Ali ibn Abu Talib at any cost\.” Aisha said, “You have caught the fear of the swords of the sons of \`Abdul\-Muttalib\.” He said, “No” and saying this, he turned the reins of his horse\. However, it is gratifying that some consideration was accorded to the Prophet’s saying, for at Haw’ab even after recollection of the Prophet’s words no more than a transient effect was taken of it\. On returning after this conversation, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) observed that they had attacked the right and left

flanks of his army\.” Noticing this, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) said, “Now the plea has been exhausted\. Call my son Muhammad\.” When he came Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) said, “My son, attack them now\. Muhammad bowed his

head and taking the standard proceeded to the battlefield\.” But arrows were falling in such exuberance that he had to stop\. When Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) saw this, he called out at him, “Muhammad\! Why do not you advance?” He said, “Father, in this shower of arrows, there is not way to proceed\. I will wait till the violence of arrows subsides\.” The Imam \(x\)

said, “No, thrust yourself in the arrows and Muhammad ibn al\-Hanafiyya advanced a little surrounded him that he had to hold his steps\. On

spears and attack\.” but the archers so seeing this a frown

<a id="page374"></a>appeared on Amir al\-Mu’minin’s forehead and said, “This is the affect of your mother’s veins\. Saying this he took the standard from his hands and folded up his sleeves and made such an attack that a tumult was created in the enemy’ ranks from one end to the other\. To which ever row he turned, it became clear and to whatever side he directed himself, bodies were seen falling and heads rolling in the hoofs of horses\. When after convulsing the rows, he returned to his status and said to Muhammad ibn al\-Hanafiyya, “Look, my son\! Battles are fought like this\.” Saying this, he gave the standard to him and ordered him to proceed\. Muhammad advanced toward the enemy with a contingent of Ansar\. The enemy also came out moving and balancing their spears\. But the brave son of the valiant father convulsed rows over rows while the other warriors made the battlefield glory and left heaps of dead bodies\.

From the other side, there was a full demonstration of the spirit of sacrifice\. Dead bodies were falling one over the other, but they continued sacrificing their lives devotedly around the camel\. Particularly, the condition of Banu Dabbah was that although their hands were being severed from the elbows for holding the reins of the camel and bosoms were being pierced yet they had the following battle song on their tongues:

To us, death is sweeter than honey\. We are Banu Dabbah, camel rearers\. We are sons of death when death comes\. We announce the death of Othman with the edges of spears\. Give us back our chief and there is an end to it\.

The low character and ignorance from faith of these Banu Dabbah can be well understood by that one incident which al\-Mada’ini has narrated\. He writes that in Basra there was a man with a mutilated ear\. He asked him its reason when he said, “I was watching the sight of dead bodies in the battlefield of Jamal when I saw a wounded man who sometimes raised his head and sometimes dashed it back on the ground\. I approached near\.” Then, the following two verses were on his lips:

Our mother pushed us into the deep waters of death and did not get back till we had thoroughly drunk\.

By misfortune, we obeyed\. Banu Taym who are none but slave men and slave girls\.

I told him it was not the time to recite verses; he should rather recall Allah and recite the kalima \(shahada\) \(verse of testimony\)\. On my

<a id="page375"></a>saying this he gave me an angry look and uttering a sever abuse said, “You are asking me to recite the kalima, get frightened at the last moment and show impatience? I was astonished to hear this and decided to return without saying anything further\. When he saw me returned he said, “Wait, for your sake I am prepared to recite, but teach me\. I drew close to teach him the kalima when he asked me to get closer\. When I got closer, he caught my ear with his teeth and did not leave it till he tore it from the root\. I did not think it proper to assault a dying man and was about to get back abusing and cursing him when he asked me to listen to one more thing\. I agreed to listen lest he had an unsatisfied wish\. He said that when I should get to my mother and she inquired who had bitten my ear, I should say that it was done by \`Umayr ibn al\-Ahlab ad\-Dabbi who had been deceived by a woman aspiring to become the commander of the faithful \(head of state\)\.

However, when the dazzling lightning of swords finished the lives of thousand of persons and hundreds of Banu Azd and Banu Dabbah were killed for holding the rein of the camel\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)

ordered, “Kill the camel, for it is Satan\.” Saying this, he made such a severe attack that the cries of ‘Peace\!’ and ‘Protection\!’ rose from all around\. When he reached near the camel he ordered Bujayr ibn Buljah to kill the camel at once\. Consequently, Bujayr hit it with such might that the camel fell in agony on the side of its bosom\. No sooner than the camel fell, the opposite army took to heels and the carrier holding Aisha was left lonely and unguarded\. The companions of Amir la\-Mu’minin took control of the carrier and under orders of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\), Muhammad ibn

Abu Bakr escorted Aisha to the house of Safiyya daughter of al\-Harith\.

This encounter commenced on the 10th of Jumada II, 36 A\.H\. in the afternoon and came to and end the same evening\. In it from Amir al\-Mu’minn’s army of twenty two thousand, one thousand and seventy or according to another version, five hundred persons were killed as martyrs while from Aisha’s army of thirty thousand, seventeen thousand persons were killed and the Prophet’s saying, “That people who assigned their affairs \(of state\) to a woman would never prosper was fully corroborated\.” \(Al\-Imama wal\-Siyasa; Muruj al\-Dhahab; al\-\`Iqd al\-Farid; al\-Tabari’s Tarikh\)\.

1. Ibn Abul\-Hadid has written that as prophesied by Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\), Basra got under the floods twice, once during the days of

al\-Qadir Billah, and once during the reign of al\-Qa’im bi Amrillah\. The condition of flooding was such that the whole city was submerged, but the

<a id="page376"></a>top ends of the mosque were seen about in the surface of the water and looked like a bird encroaching on its bosom’s side\.

**Sermon 14**

**Also Condemning the People of Basra**

Your earth is close to the sea and away from the sky\. Your wits have become light and your minds are full of folly\. You are the aim of the archer, a morsel for the eater and an easy prey for the hunter\.

**Sermon 15**

**After Resuming the Land Grants Made My Othman Ibn Affan \[To the State Treasury\], He Said:**

By Allah\! Even if I had found that by such money women have been married or bondmaids have been purchased I would have resumed it because there is a wide scope in dispensation of justice and he who find it hard to act justly should find it harder to deal with injustice\.

**Sermon 16**

**Delivered When Allegiance Was Sworn to Him at Medina**

The responsibility for what I say is guaranteed and I am answerable for it\. He to whom experiences have clearly shown the past exemplary punishments \(given by Allah to people\) is prevented by piety from falling into doubts\. You should know that the same troubles have returned to you which existed when the Prophet \(h\) was first sent\.

By Allah Who sent the Prophet \(h\) with faith and truth\! You

will be severely subverted, bitterly shaken s in sieving and fully mixed as by spooning in a cooking pot till your low persons become high and high ones become low, those who were behind would attain forward positions and those who were forward would become backward\. By Allah, I have not concealed a single word or spoken any lie and I had been informed of this event and of this time\.

Beware that sins are like unruly horses on whom their riders have been placed and their reins have been let loose so that they would jump

<a id="page377"></a>with them in Hell\. Beware that piety is like trained horses on whom the riders have been placed with the reins in the hands so that they would take the riders to Heaven\. There is right and wrong and there are followers for each\. If wrong dominates, it has \(always\) in the past been so and if truth goes down that too has often occurred\. It seldom happens that a thing that lags behind comes forward\.

Ash\-Sharif ar\-Radi says the following by way of commenting on the above: “In the short speech, there is more beauty than can be appreciated and the quantity of amazement aroused by it is more than can be appreciated\. Despite what we have stated, it has so many aspects of eloquence that cannot be expressed, nor can anyone reach its depth\. And no one can understand what I am saying unless one has attained this are and known its details\.”

No one appreciates it except those who know \(Holy Quran, 29: 43\)

**From the Same Sermon:**

He who has heaven and hell in his view has no other aim\. He who attempts and acts quickly succeeds, while the seeker who is slow may also entertain hope\. And he who falls short of actions faces destruction in Hell\. On the right and left there are misleading paths\. Only the middle way if the \(right\) path which is the Everlasting book and the traditions of the Prophet \(h\)\. From it the Sunnah has spread out and toward it is the

eventual return\.

He who claims \(otherwise\) is ruined and he who concocts falsehood is disappointed\. He who opposes1 the right with his face gets destruction\. It is enough ignorance for a man not to know himself\. He who is strong rooted2 in piety does not get destruction and the plantation of the people based on piety never remains without water\. Hide yourselves in your houses and reform yourselves\. Repentance is at your back\. One should praise only Allah and condemn only his own self\.

In some versions of this same sermon, after the words man abda safhatahu lilhaqqi halaka, the words inda jahalatu’n\-nas also occur\. In tat case, the meaning of this sentence would be that he who stands in the face of right dies in the estimation of the ignorant\.

Piety is the connotation of the heart and the mind being affected and impressed by the Divine Greatness and Gory\. As an effect of it, the spirit of man becomes full of the fear of Allah and its inevitable result is

<a id="page378"></a>that engrossment in worship and prayers increases\. It is impossible that the heart may be full of the Divine fear and there be no manifestation of it in actions and deeds\. And since worship and submission reform the heart and nurture the spirit, purity of heart increases with the increase of worship\. That is why in the Holy Quran, Ataqwa \(piety\) has been applied sometimes to fear, in the verse, Ittaqul\-laha haqqa tuqatihi \(worship Allah as He ought to be worshipped\) \(3: 102\)\. Taqwa implies worship and devotion, and in the verse wa yakhsha’l\- laha wa yattaqhi faullaika humul faizun \(24: 52\) taqwa implies purity of the spirit and cleanliness of the heart\.

In the traditions, taqwa has been assigned three degrees\. The first degree is that a man should follow the injunctions and keep aloof from prohibitions\. The second degree is that recommended matters should also be followed and disliked things should be avoided\. The third degree is that for fear of falling into doubts, one may abstain from the permissible as well\. The first degree is for the common men, the second for the nobles and the third for the high dignitaries\. Allah has referred to these three degrees in the following verse:

On those who believe and do good, is not blame for what they ate \(before\) when they did guard themselves and did believe and did good, still \(furthermore\) they guard themselves and do good, and Allah loves the doers of good\. \(Holy Quran, 5: 93\)

Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) says that only action based on piety is

lasting and only that action will blossom and bear fruit which is watered by piety because worship is only that wherein the feeling of submissiveness exists\. Thus, Allah says the following:

Is he, therefore, better who has laid his foundation on fear of Allah and \(His\) goodwill or he who lays his foundation on the brink of a crumbling bank so it broke down with him into the fire of hell?\(Holy Quran 9: 109\)

Consequently, every such belief as is not based on knowledge and conviction is like the edifice, erected without foundation, wherein there is no stability or firmness while every action that is without piety is like the plantation which withers because of not being watered\.

**About Those Who Sit for Dispensation of Justice among People but Are Not Fit for It**

Among all the people, the most detested before Allah are two persons\. One is he who is devoted to his self\. So he is deviated from the true path and loves speaking about \(foul\) innovations and inviting toward the wrong path\. He is, therefore, a nuisance for those who are enamored of him, is himself misled from the guidance of those enamored of him, is himself misled from the guidance of those preceding him, misleads those who follow him in his life or after his death, carries the weight of others’ sins and is entangled in his own misdeeds\.

The other man is he who has picked up ignorance\. He moves among the ignorant, is senseless in the thick of mischief and is blind to the advantages of peace\. Those resembling like men have named him scholar but he is not so\. He goes out early morning to collect things whose deficiency is better than plenty, till when he has quenched his thirst form polluted water and acquired meaningless things\.

He sits among the people as a judge responsible for solving whatever is confusing to the others\. If an ambiguous problem is presented before him he manages a shabby argument about it of his own accord and passes judgment on its basis\. In this way, he is entangled in the confusion of doubts as in the spider’s web, not knowing whether he was right or wrong\. If he is right, he fears lest he errs, while if he is wrong, he hopes he is right\. He is ignorant, wandering astray in ignorance and riding on carriages aimlessly moving in darkness\. He does not try to find the reality of knowledge\. He scatters the traditions as the wind scatters the dry leaves\.

By Allah\! He is not capable of solving the problems that come to him nor is he fit of the status assigned to him\. Whatever he does not know he doses not regard it worth knowing\. He does not realize that what is beyond his reach is within the reach of others\. If anything is not clear to him, he keeps quiet over it because he knows his own ignorance\. Lost lives are crying against his unjust verdicts and properties \(that have been wrongly disposed of\) are grumbling against him\.

I complain to Allah about persons who live ignorant and die misguided\. For them nothing is more worthless than Holy Quran if it is

<a id="page380"></a>recited as it should be recited, nor anything more valuable than the Holy Quran if is verses are removed from their places, nor anything more vicious than virtue nor more virtuous than vice\.

Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) has held two categories of persons as the

most detestable by Allah and the worst among people\. Firstly, those who are misguided even in basic tenets and are busy in the spreading of evil\. Secondly, those who abandon the Holy Quran and Sunnah and pronounce injunctions through their imagination\. They create a circle of their devotees and popularize the religious code of law concocted by themselves\. The misguidance and wrongfulness of such persons does not remain confined to their own selves but the seed of misguidance sown by them bears fruit and, growing into the form of a big tree, provides an asylum to the misguided\. This misguidance goes on multiplying\. And since these very people are the real originators, the weight of other’s sins is also on their shoulders as the Holy Quran says the following:

And certainly, they shall bear their own burdens and \(others’\)

burdens with their own burdens\. \(Holy Quran, 29: 13\)

**Sermon 18**

**Amir Al\-Mu’minin \(x\) Said in Disparagement of the Differences of Views among the Theologians**

When a problem is put before anyone of them he passes judgment on it from his imagination\. When exactly the same problem is placed before another of them he passes an opposite verdict\. Then these judges go to the chief who had appointed them and he confirms all the verdicts, although their Allah is One \(and the same\), their Prophet \(h\) is one \(and

the same\), their Book \(the Holy Quran\), is one \(and the same\)\.

Is it that Allah ordered them to differ and they obeyed Him? Or He prohibited them from it but hey disobeyed Him? Or \(is it that\) Allah sent an incomplete Faith and sought their help to complete it? Or they are His partners in the affairs so that it is their share of duty to pronounce and He as to agree? Or is it that Allah, the most Glorified One, sent a perfect faith but the Prophet \(h\) fell short of conveying it and handing it over \(to

the people\) ? the fact is that Allah, the most Glorified One, says the following:

<a id="page381"></a>We have not neglected anything in the Book \(Quran\)\. \(Holy Quran, 6: 38\)

Allah says that one part of the Holy Quran verifies another part and that there is no divergence in it as He says the following:

And if it had been from any other than Allah, they would surely have found in it much discrepancy\. \(Holy Quran, 4: 82\)

Certainly, the outside of the Holy Quran is wonderful and its inside is deep \(in meaning\)\. Its wonders will never disappear, its amazing things will never pass away and its intricacies cannot be cleared except through itself\.

It is a disputed problem that where there is no clear argument about a matter in the religious law, whether there does in reality exist an order about it or not\. The view adopted by Abul\- Hassan al\-Ash\`ari and his master Abu Ali al \-Jubba’i is that in such a case Allah has not ordained any particular course of action but He assigned the task of finding it out and passing a verdict to the jurists so that whatever they hold as prohibited would be deemed prohibited and whatever they regard permissible would be deemed permissible\. And if one has one view and the other another, then as many verdicts will exist as there are views and each of them would represent the final order\. For example, if one scholar holds that barley malt is prohibited and another jurist’s view is that it is permissible, then it would really be both prohibited and permissible\. That is, for one who holds is prohibited, its use would be prohibited while for the other its use would be permissible\. About this \(theory of\) correctness, Muhammad ibn Abdul\-Karim al\-Shahristani writes the following:

A group of theorists hold that in matters where ijtihad \(research\) is applied there is no settled view about permissibility or; otherwise, and and lawfulness and prohibition thereof, but whatever the mujtahid \(the researcher scholar\) hold is the order of Allah because the ascertainment of the view of Allah depends upon the verdict of the mujtahid\. If it is not so, there will be no verdict at all\. And according to this view, every mujtahid would be correct in his opinion\. Refer to p\. 98 of Al\-Milal wal Nihal\.

In this case, the mujtahid is taken to be above mistake because a mistake can be deemed to occur where a step is taken against reality, but where there is not reality of verdict, mistake has no sense\. Besides this, the mujtahid can be considered to be above mistake if it is held that Allah, being aware of all the views that were likely to be adopted has ordained as

<a id="page382"></a>many final orders as a result of which every view corresponds to some such order, or that Allah has assured that the views adopted by the mujtahids should not go beyond what He has ordained, or that by chance, the view of everyone of them would, after all, correspond to some ordained order or other\.

The Imamiyyah sect, however, has a different theory, namely that Allah has neither assigned to anyone the right to legislate nor subjected any matter to the view of the mujtahid, nor in case of a difference of views has He ordained numerous real orders\. Of course, if the mujtahid cannot arrive at a real order than whatever view he takes after research and probing is enough for him and his followers to act by\. Such an order is the apparent order which is a substitute for the real order\. In this case, he is excused for missing the real order because he did his best for diving in the deep ocean and to explore its bottom\. But, it is a pity that instead of pearls he go only the seashell\. He dos not say that observers should except it as a pearl or it should see as such\. It is a different matter that Allah, who watches the endeavors, may price it at half so that the endeavor does not go to waste nor his passion discouraged\.

If the theory of correctness is adopted then every verdict on law and every opinion shall have to be accepted as correct as Maybudhi has written in fatwa: “In this matter, the view adopted by al\-Ash\`ari is right\. It follows that differing opinions should all be right\. Beware, do not bear a bad idea about jurists and do not open your tongue to abuse them\.

When contrary theories and divergent views are accepted as correct, it is strange why the action of some conspicuous individuals are explained as mistakes of decision since mistakes of decision by the mujtahid cannot be imagined at all\. If the theory of correctness is right, the action of Mu\`awiyah and \`\}’isha should be deemed right; but if their actions can be deemed to be wrong then we should agree that ijtihad can also go wrong and that the theory of correctness is wrong\. It will then remain to be decided in its own context whether feminism did not impede the decision of Aisha or whether it was a \(wrong\) finding of Mu\`awiyah or something else\. However, this theory of correctness was propounded in order to cover mistakes and to give them the garb of Allah’s orders so that there should be no impediment in achieving objectives nor should anyone be able to speak against any misdeeds\.

In this sermon, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) has referred to those people

who deviate from the path of Allah and closing their eyes to light, grope in the darkness of imagination, make faith the victim of their views and

<a id="page383"></a>opinions, pronounce new findings, pass orders by their own imagination and produce divergent results\. Then on the basis of the theory of correctness, they regard all these divergent and contrary orders as from Allah as though each of their orders represent the Divine revelation so that no order of theirs can be wrong nor can they stumble on any occasion\. Thus, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) says in disproving this view that:

1. When Allah is One, the Book \(Holy Quran\) is one and the Prophet \(h\) is one, then the religion \(that is followed\) should also be one\.

And when the religion is one, how can there be divergent orders about any matter because there can be divergence in an order only in case he who passed the order has forgotten it or is oblivious or senselessness overtakes him or he willfully desires entanglement in these labyrinths while Allah and the Prophet \(h\) are above these things\. These

divergences cannot, therefore, be attributed to them\. These divergences are rather the outcome of the thinking and opinions of people who are bent on twisting the delineations of religion by their own imaginative performances\.

1. Allah must have either forbidden these divergences or ordered creating them\. If He has ordered in their favor, where is that order and at what place? As for forbidding, the Holy Quran says the following:

Say: Has Allah permitted you, or do you forge a lie against

Allah?\! \(Holy Quran 10: 59\)

That is, everything that is not in accordance with the Divine orders is a concoction and concoction is forbidden and prohibited\. For those who concoct things, there is in the next world neither success, nor achievement, nor prosperity and good\. Thus Allah says the following:

And utter you not whatever lie describes your tongues \(saying\): This is lawful and this is forbidden, to forge a lie against Allah; verily, those who forge a lie against Allah do not succeed\. \(Holy Quran, 16: 116\)

If Allah has left religion incomplete and the reason for leaving it halfway was that He desired that the people should assist Him in completely the religious code and share with Him in the task of legislating, then this belief is obviously polytheism\. If He sent down the religion in complete form, the Prophet \(h\) must have failed in conveying

it so that room was left for others to apply imagination and opinion\. This,

<a id="page384"></a>Allah forbid, would mean a weakness of the Prophet \(h\) and a bad slur of the selection of Allah\.

1. Allah has said in the Holy Quran that He has not left out anything in the Book and has clarified each and every matter\. Now, if an order is carved out in conflict with the Holy Quran it would be outside the religious code and its basis would not be on knowledge and perception, or the Holy Quran and Sunnah, but it would be a personal opinion and one’s personal judgment which cannot be deemed to have accord with religion and faith\.
2. Holy Quran is the basis and source of religion and the fountain head of the laws of Shari’a\. If the laws of Shari’a were divergent, there should have been divergence in it also\. And, if there were divergences in it, it could not be regarded as the Divine word\. When it is the Divine word the laws of Shari\`a cannot be divergent so as to accept all divergent and contrary views as correct and imaginative verdicts taken as Quranic dictates\.

**Sermon 19**

**Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) delivering a lecture from the pulpit of \(the mosque of\) Kufa when al\-Ash\`ath ibn Qays1 objected and said, “O Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)\! This thing is not in your favor but against you\.2 Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) looked at him with anger and said:**

127Who is this al\-Ash\`ath ibn Qays al\-Kindi, anyway? His original name was Ma\`di Karb and surname Abu Muhammad but, because of his disheveled hair, he is better known as Al\-Ash\`ath, one having disheveled hair\. After the proclamation of Prophethood, he came to Mecca along with his tribe\. The Prophet \(h\) invited him and his tribe to accept Islam\. When, after the _Hijra_ \(migration of

the Holy Prophet \[h\] from Mecca to Medina\), Islam became established and in full

swing\. Deputations began to come to Medina in large numbers\. He, too, came to the Prophet’s audience with Banu Kindah and accepted Islam\. The author of _Al\-Isti\`ab_ writes that after the Prophet \(h\), this man again turned unbeliever but when the

Caliphate of Abu Bakr, he was brought to _Medina_ as a prisoner, he again accepted Islam, though this time too, his Islam was a show\. Thus, Shaikh Muhammad \`Abdo writes in his annotations on _Nahjul\-Balagha_:

Just as Abdullah ibn Ubayy ibn Sallul was a companion of the Prophet \(h\), al\-Ash\`ath was a companion of Ali and both were high\-ranking hypocrites\. He

<a id="page385"></a>How do you know what is for me and what is against me? Curse of Allah and other be on you\. You are a weaver and son of a weaver\. You are the son of an unbeliever and yourself a hypocrite\. You were arrested once by the unbelievers and once by the Muslims, but you wealth and birth could not save you from either\. The man who contrives for his own people to be put to sword and invites death and destruction for them does deserve that the near ones should hate him and the remote ones should not trust him\.

As\-Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “This man was arrested once when an unbeliever and once in the days of Islam\.” As for Amir al\-Mu’minin’s words that the man contrived for his own people to be put to the sword, the reference herein is to the incident which occurred to al\-

lost one of his eyes in the battle of Yarmuk\. Ibn Qutaybah has included him in the list of renown one\-eyed personalities\. Abu Bakr’s sister, Umm Farwah daughter of Ibn Abu Quhafah, who was once the wife of an al\-Azdi then of _Tamim_ ad\- Darmi, was on the third occasion married to this al\-Ash\`ath\. Three sons were born of her: Muhammad, Isma’il and Ishaq\. Biography books indicate that she was blind\. Ibn Abul\-Hadid has quoted the following statement of Abul\-Faraj wherefrom it appears that this man was equally involved in the assassination of Ali \(x\):

On the night of the assassination \[of Imam Ali \(x\)\], Ibn Muljim came to

al\-Ash\`ath ibn Qays and both retired to a corner of the mosque and sat there when Hijr ibn Adiy passed by that side and he heard al\-Ash\`ath saying to Ibn Muljim, ABe quick now or else dawn’s light will disgrace you\. On hearing this, Hijr said to al\-Ash\`ath, “O one\-eyed man\! You are getting ready to kill Ali \(x\) and hastened toward Ali ibn Abu Talib\. But Ibn Muljim had preceded him and struck Ali with a sword\. When Hijr turned back, people were crying\. Ali \(x\) had been killed\.

It was his daughter who killed Imam Hassan \(x\) with poison\. Al\-Mas\`udi has written the following:

His \(Hassan’s\) wife Ja\`dah daughter of al\-Ash\`ath poisoned him while Mu\`awiyah had conspired with her that if she could contrive to poison Hassan \(x\),

he would pay her one hundred thousand dirhams and marry her to \[his son\] Yazid\. \(Refer to _Muruj al\-Dhahab_, Vol\. 2, p\. 650\)

His son, Muhammad ibn al\-Ash\`ath, was active in playing fraud with Muslim bin Aqil in Kufa and in shedding Imam Hussain’s blood in Kerbala’\. Despite all these shameful stigmas, he is among those men from whom al\- Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud, al\-Tirmidhi, al\-Nisa’i and Ibn Majah have related traditions\.\.\.\!

<a id="page386"></a>Ash\`ath ibn Qays in confrontation with Khalid ibn al\-Walid at Yamama, where he deceived his people and contrived a trick until Khalid attacked them\. After this incident his people nicknamed him, “\`Urfan\-Nar,” which in the parlance stood for “traitor”\.

After the battle of Nahrawan, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) was delivering a sermon in the mosque of Kufa about the ill effects of Arbitration when a man stood up and said, “O Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)\!

First you discouraged us from this arbitration but thereafter you allowed it\. We cannot understand which of these two was more correct and proper\. On hearing this, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) clapped his one hand over the

other \[as a sign of sorrow and grief as well as helplessness\] and said, “This is the reward of one who gives up a firm view that is, this is the outcome of your own actions as you had abandoned firmness and caution and insisted on “arbitration”, but al\-Ash\`ath mistook it to mean as though Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) implied that Amy worry was due to having

accepted arbitration, so he spoke out thus: “O Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)\! This brings blame on your own self, whereupon Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) said the

following with firmness: “What do you know what I am saying, “nd what do you understand what is for me or against me?\! You are a weaver and the son of a weaver brought up by unbelievers, and a hypocrite are you\. The curse of Allah and that of all the world be upon you\.”

Commentators have written several reasons for Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) calling al\-Ash\`ath a weaver and a hypocrite\. The first

reason is because he and his father, like most of the people of his native land, pursued weaving cloth\. So, in order to refer to the lowliness of his occupation, he has been called a “weaver”\. The people of Yemen had other occupations also but mostly this profession was followed among them\. Describing their occupations, Khalid ibn Safwan has mentioned this one first of all\.

What can I say about a people among whom are only weavers, leather dyers, monkey keepers and donkey riders? The hoopoe found them out, the mouse flooded them128 and a woman ruled over them \(Al\-Bayan wal\-Tabyin, Vol\. 1, p\. 130\)\.

128This is a reference to the collapse of the famous Ma’rab Dam which was once considered one of the engineering marvels of ancient times\. Its collapse, which is believed to have taken place between B\.C\. 650 \- 115, caused the Arabs to migrate from Yemen and populate other parts of the Arabian peninsula\. \_\_ Ed\.

<a id="page387"></a>The second reason is that hiyaka means walking by bending on either side and since out of pride and conceit this man used to walk shrugging his shoulders and making bends in this body, he has been called hayik\.

The third reason is this: It is more conspicuous and clear that he has been called a weaver to denote his foolishness and lowliness because every low person is proverbially known as a “weaver”\. Their wisdom and sagacity can be well\-gauged by the fact that their follies had become proverbial while nothing attains proverbial status without peculiar characteristics\. Now that Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) has also confirmed it, no

further argument or reasoning is needed\.

The fourth reason is that by this it is meant the person who conspired against Allah and the Holy Prophet \(h\) and prepared webs of

which is the peculiarity of hypocrites\. Thus, in Wasa’il ash\- Shi\`a \(Vol\. 12, p\. 101\) it is stated that: “It was mentioned before Imam Ja\`far as\-Sadiq \(x\) that the weaver is accursed when he explained that the weaver

implies the person who concocts against Allah and the Prophet \(h\)\.”

After the word “weaver,” Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) has used the

word hypocrite and there is no conjunction in between them in order to emphasize the nearness of meaning thereof\. Then, on the basis of this hypocrisy and concealment of truth, he declared him deserving of the curse of Allah and all others, as Allah, the most Glorified One, says the following:

Verily, those that conceal what we have sent of \(Our\) manifest evidences and guidance, after what we have \(so\) clearly shown for mankind in the Book \(they are\), those that Allah does curse them and \(also\) curse them all those who curse \(such ones\) \(Holy Quran, 2: 159\)\.

After this, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) said, “You could not avoid the

degradation of being prisoner when you were unbeliever, not did these ignominies spare you after acceptance of Islam and you were taken prisoner\. When an unbeliever, the event of his being taken prisoner occurred in this way that when the tribe of Banu Murad killed his father Qays, he \(al\-Ash\`ath\) gathered the warriors of Banu Kindah and divided them into three groups\. He himself took the command over one group\. On the others, he placed Ka\`b ibn Hani’ and al\-Qash\`am ibn Yazid al\-Arqam

<a id="page388"></a>as commanders\. They set off to deal with Banu Murad\. But as misfortune would have it, instead of Banu Murad, they attacked Banu al\-Harith ibn Ka\`b\. The result was that Ka\`b ibn Hani’ and al\-Qash’am ibn Yazid al\-Arqam were killed and this man was taken prisoner\. Eventually, he got released by paying three thousand camels as his ransom\. In Amir al\-Mu’minin’s words, “Your wealth or birth could not save you from either is a reference not to the real ransom money because he was actually released on payment of the release money, but the intention is that neither plenty of wealth nor high status and prestige in the tribe could save him from this ignominy, and he could not protect himself from being taken captive\.

The event of his second imprisonment is that when the Holy Prophet of Islam \(h\) passed away from this world, a rebellion took place

in the area of Hadramawt for repelling which Caliph Abu Bakr wrote to its governor, Ziyad ibn Labid al\-Bayadi al\-Ansari, to secure allegiance and collect zakat and charities from those people\. When Ziyad ibn Labid went to the tribe of Banu Amr ibn Mu\`awiyah for collecting the zakat, he took a keen fancy for a she\-camel of Shaytan ibn Hijr which was very handsome and had a huge body\. He jumped over it and took possession of it\. Shaytan ibn Hijr did not agree to spare it and suggested to him to take some other she\-camel in its place, but Ziyad did not agree\. Shaytan sent for his brother al\-Adda’ ibn Hijr for his support\. On coming he too had a talk but Ziyad insisted on this point and did not, by any means, consent to keep off his hand from that she\-camel\. At last, both these brothers appealed to Masruq ibn Ma’di Karib for help\. Consequently, Masruq also used his influence so that Ziyad might leave the she\-camel but he refused categorically, whereupon Masruq became enthusiastic and untying the she\-camel handed it over to Satan\. On this, Ziyad was infuriated and collecting his men became ready to fight\. On the other side, Banu Wali’ah also assembled to face the but could not defeat Ziyad and were badly beaten at his hands\. Their women were taken away and property was looted\. Eventually those who had survived were obliged to take refuge under the protection of al\-Ash\`ath\. Al\-Ash\`ath promised assistance on the condition that he should be acknowledged ruler of the area\. Those people agreed to this condition and his coronation was also formally solemnized\. After having his authority acknowledged he arranged an army and set out to fight Ziyad\. On the other side Abu Bakr had written to the chief of Yemen, al\- Muhajir ibn Abu Umayyah to go for the help of Ziyad with a contingent\. Al\-Muhajir was coming with his contingent when they came face\-to\-face\. Seeing each other, they drew swords and commenced fighting at az\-Zurqan\. In the end al\-Ash\`ath fled from the battle\-field and taking his remaining men closed himself in the fort of an\-Najjar\. The

<a id="page389"></a>enemy was such as to let them alone\. They laid siege around the fort\. Al\-Ash\`ath thought how long could he remain shut up I the fort with the lack of equipment and men and that he should think out some way of escape\. So one night he stealthily came out of the fort and met Ziyad and al\-Muhajir and conspired with them that if they gave asylum to nine members of his family, he would get the fort gate opened\. They accepted this term and asked him to write for them, the names of those nine persons\. He wrote down the nine names, but acting on his traditional wisdom forgot to write his own name in that list\. After settling this, he told his people that he had secured protection for them and the gate of the fort should be opened\. When the gate was opened Ziy\\sect fs22 ad As forces pounced upon them\. They said they had been promised protection whereupon Ziyad’s army said that this was wrong and that al\-Ash\`ath had asked protection only for nine members of his house, whose names were preserved with them\. In short, eight hundred persons were put to sword and the hands of several women were hopped off, while according to the settlement, nine men were left, but the case of al\-Ash\`ath became complicated\. Eventually, it was decided that he should be sent to Abu Bakr and he should decide about him\. At last, he was sent to Medina in chains along with a thousand women prisoners\. On the way, relations and others, men and women, all hurled curses at him and the women were calling him traitor and the one who got his own people put to sword\. Who else can be a great traitor? However, when he reached Meduna, Abu Bakr released him and on that occasion, he was married to Umm Farwah\.

**Death and Learning Lessons From It**

If you could see what has been seen by those of you who have died, you would be puzzled and troubled\. Then you would have listened and obeyed; but what they have seen is yet curtained off from you\. Shortly, the curtain would be thrown off\. You have been shown, provided you see and you have been made to listen provided you listen and you have been guided if you accept guidance\. I spoke unto you with truth\. You have been called aloud by \(instructive\) examples and warned through items full of warnings\. After the heavenly messengers \(angels\), only man can convey the message from Allah\. \(So what I am conveying is from Allah\)\.

**Advice to Keep Light in this World**

Your aim \(reward or punishment\) is before you\. Behind your back is the hour \(of resurrection\) which is driving you on\. Keep \(yourself\) light and overtake \(the forward ones\)\. Your last ones are being awaited by the first ones \(who have preceded you\)\.

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “If this utterance of Ali \(x\) is weighed with any other utterance except the words of Allah or of the Holy Prophet \(h\), it would prove heavier and superior in every respect\.

For example, Ali’s saying “keep light and overtake’ is the shortest expression every heard with the greatest sense conveyed\. How broad its meaning is and how clear its spring of wisdom\! We have pointed out the greatness and meaningfulness of this phrase in our book Al\-Khasa’is\.

**Sermon 22**

**About Those Who Accused Him of \`Othman’s Killing**

Beware\! Satan has certainly started instigating his forces and has collected his army in order that oppression may reach its extreme ends and wrong may come back to its status\. By Allah, they have not put a correct blame on me, nor have they done justice between me and themselves\.

They are demanding of me a right which they have abandoned and a blood that they have themselves shed\. If I were a partner with them in it then they too have their share of it\. But if they did it without me they alone have to face the consequences\. Their biggest argument \(against me\) is really against their own selves\. They are suckling from a mother who is already dry and bringing into life innovation that is already dead\. How disappointing is this challenger 9to battle\) ? Who is this challenger and for what is he being responded to? I am happy that the reasoning of Allah has been exhausted before them and He knows \(all\) about them\. If they refuse \(to obey\) I will offer them the edge of the sword which is enough of a cure of wrong and supporter of right\.

It is strange that they send me word to proceed to them for spear\-fighting and to keep ready for fighting with swords\. May the mourning women mourn over them\. I have ever been so that I as never frightened

<a id="page391"></a>by fighting nor threatened by clashing\. I enjoy full certainty of belief from my Allah and have no doubt in my faith\.

When Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) was accused of \`Othman’s

assassination, he delivered this sermon to refute that allegation, wherein he says about those who blamed him that: “These seekers of vengeance cannot say that I alone am the assassin and that no one else took part in it\. Nor can they falsify witnessed events by saying that they were unconcerned with it\. Why then have they put me foremost for this avenging? With me they should include themselves also\. If I am free of this blame they cannot establish their freedom from it\. How can they detach themselves from this punishment? the truth of the matter is that by accusing me of this charge, their aim is that I should behave with them in the same manner to which they are accustomed\. But they should behave with them in the same manner to which they are accustomed\. But they should not expect from me that I would revive the innovations of the previous regimes\. As for fighting, neither was I ever afraid of it nor am I so now\. Allah knows my intention and He also knows that those standing on the excuse of taking revenge are themselves his assassins\. Thus, history corroborates that the people who managed his \(Othman’s\) assassination by agitation and had even prevented his burial in Muslims’ graveyard by hurling stones at his coffin were the same who rose for avenging his blood\. In this connection, the names of Talhah ibn Ubaydillah, az\-Zubayr ibn al\-Awwam and Aisha are at the top of the list since on both occasions their efforts come to sigh with conspicuity\. Thus ibn Abul\-Hadid writes that: “Those who have written the account f the assassination of Othman state that one ht day of his killing Talhah’s condition was that in order to obscure himself form the eyes of the people he had a veil on his face and was shooting arrows at Othman’s house\.”

And, in this connection about az\-Zubayr ideas he writes the following: “Historians have also stated that az\-Zubayr used to say: “Kill Othman\. He has altered your faith\.’129 People said, “Your son is standing at his door and guarding him and he replied, “Even my son my be lost, but Othman must be killed\. Othman will be lying like a carcass on the Sirat tomorrow” \(Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 9, pp\. 35\-36\)\.

129Az\-Zubayr here was echoing what his cousin, Aisha, used to say, that is, _Uqtulu Na\`thal faqad kafar _\(Kill Na\`thal \[a bad name whereby she called Othman\],\* \*for he has committed apostasy\)\. \_\_ Ed\.

<a id="page392"></a>About Aisha, Ibn Abd Rabbih writes the following: “Mughirah ibn Shu’bah came to Aisha when she said, “O Abu Abdullah, I wish you have been with me on the day of Jamal; how arrows were piercing through my hawdaj \(camel litter\) till some of them stuck my body\.’ Al\-Mughirah said, “I wish one of them should have killed you\.’ She said, “Allah may have pity on you; why so?’ He replied, “So that it would have been some atonement for what you had done against Othman’, according to Al\-Iqd al\-Farid, Vol\. 4, p\. 294\.

**About Keeping Aloof from Envy and Good Behavior Towards Kith and Kin**

Verily the Divine orders descend form heaven to earth like drops of rain bringing to everyone what is destined for him whether plenty or paucity\. So if any one of you observes for his brother plenty of progeny or of wealth or of self, it should not be a worry for him\. So long as a Muslim does not commit such an act that if it is disclosed, he has to bend his eyes \(in shame\) and by which low people are emboldened he is like the gambler who expects that the first draw of his arrow would secure him gain and also cover up the previous loss\.

Similarly, the Muslim who is free from dishonesty expects one of the two good things; either a cal from Allah and in that case whatever is with Allah is the best for him or the livelihood of Allah\. He has already children and property while his faith and respect are with him\. Certainly, wealth and children are the plantations of this world while virtuous deeds are the plantation of the next world\. Sometimes, Allah joins all these in some groups\.

Beware of Allah against what He has cautioned you and keep afraid of Him to the extend that no excuse be needed for it\. Act without show or intention of being heard for if a man acts for some one else then Allah makes him over to that one\. We ask Allah to grant us\) the positions of the martyrs, company of the virtuous and friendship of the prophets\.

O people\! Surely no one \(even though he may be rich\) can do without his kinsmen and their support by hands or tongues\. They alone are his support from the rear and can ward off from him his troubles and they are the most kind to him when tribulations befall him\. The good

<a id="page393"></a>memory of a man that Allah retains among people is better than the property which others inherit from him\.

**In the same sermon, he says the following:**

Behold\! If any one of you finds your near ones in want or starvation, he should not desist from helping them with that which will not increase if this help is not extended nor decrease by thus spending it\. Whoever holds up his hand from \(helping\) his kinsmen, he holds only one hand, but at the same time of his need, many hands remain held up form helping him\. One who is sweet\-tempered can retain the love of his people for good\.

As\-Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “In this sermon, al\-ghafira means plenty or abundance and this is derived from the Arab saying, al\-jam\` al\-ghafir meaning thick crowd\. In some versions for al\-ghafira, the word afwatan appears\. Afwa means the good and selected part of anything\. It is said: akaltu afwata’t\-ta\`am, to mean ‘I ate a choice meal\.’” About Awa man yaqbid yadahu an’ashiratihi appearing towards the end, he points out how beautiful the meaning of this sentence is, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) implies that he who does not help his own kinsmen

withholds only his hand but when he is in need of their assistance and would be looking for their sympathy and support, then he would remain deprived of the sympathies and succor of so many of their extending hands and marching feet\.

**Sermon 25**

**When Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) received successive news that**

**Mu\`awiyah’s men were occupying cities1 and his own officers in Yemen namely \`Ubaydullah ibn \`Abbas and Sa’i d ibn Imran came to him retreating after being overpowered by Bisr ibn Abu Arta’ah, he was much disturbed by the slackness of his own men in jihad and their difference with his opinion\. Proceeding on the pulpit, he said:**

Nothing \(is left to me\) but Kufa which I can hold and extend \(which is in my hand to play with\)\. \(O Kufa\) if this is your condition that whirlwinds continue blowing through you then Allah may destroy you\.

<a id="page394"></a>**Then he illustrated with this verse of a poet:**

O Amr\! By your good father’s life, I have received only a small bit of fat from this pot \(fat that remains sticking to it even after it has been emptied\)\.

**Then he went on to say:**

I have been informed that Bisr has overpowered Yemen\. By Allah, I have begun thinking about these people that they would shortly snatch away the whole country through their unity on their wrong and your disunity \(from your own right\) and separation, your disobedience of your Imam in matters of right and their obedience to their leader in matters of wrong, their fulfillment of the trust in favor of their master and your betrayal, their god work in their cities and your mischief\. Even if I give you charge of a wooden bowl I fear you would run away with its handle\.

O Lord\! They are disgusted of me and I am disgusted of them\. They are weary of me and I am weary of them\. Change them for me with better ones and change me for them with a worse one\. O my Allah melt their hearts as salt melts in water\. By Allah I wish I had only a thousand horsemen of Banu Firas ibn Ghanm \(as the poet says\):

If you call them the horsemen would come to you like the summer cloud\.

**Thereafter, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) stepped down from the**

**pulpit\.**

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “In this verse, the word armiyah is plural of ramiyy which means cloud and hamin here means summer\. The poet has particularized the cloud of summer because it moves swiftly\. This is so because it is devoid of water while a cloud moves slowly when it is laden with rain\. Such clouds generally appear \(in Arabia\) in winter\. By this verse, the poet intends to convey that when they are called and referred to for help they approach with rapidity and this is borne by the first line “If you call them, they will reach you\.”

**Arabia Before the Proclamation of Prophethood**

<a id="page395"></a>Allah sent Muhammad \(h\) as a warner \(against vice\) for all the

worlds and a trustee of His revelation, while you people of Arabia were following the worst religion and you resided among rough stones and venomous serpents\. You drank dirty water and ate filthy food\. You shed the blood of each other and cared not for relationships\. Idols were fixed among you and sins were clinging to you\.

**A portion of the same sermon on the attentiveness of the people after the death of the Holy Prophet \(h\):**

I looked and found that there was no supporter for me except my family, so I refrained from thrusting them unto death\. I kept my eyes closed despite motes in them\. I drank despite a choking of the throat\. I exercised patience despite trouble in breathing and despite having to take sour colocynth as food\.

**Part of the same sermon on the settlement between**

**Mu\`awiyah and Amr ibn al\-As:**

He did not swear allegiance till he got him to agree that he would pay him its price\. The hand of this purchaser \(of allegiance\) may not be successful and the contract of the seller may face disgrace\. Now you should take up arms for war and arrange equipment for it\. Its flames have grown high and its brightness has increased\. Clothe yourself with patience for it is the best to victory\.130

130Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) had delivered a sermon before setting off for

Nahrawan\. These are three parts from it\. In the first part he has described the condition of Arabia before the Proclamation \(of Prophethood\); in the second he has referred to circumstances which forced him to keep quiet and in the third he has described the conversation and settlement between Mu\`awiyah and \`Amr ibn al\-As\. The status of this mutual settlement was that when Amr al\-Mu’minn \(x\) sent Jarir

ibn Abdillah al\-Bajali to Mu\`awiyah to secure his allegiance, he detained Jarir under the excuse of giving a reply\. In the meantime he began exploring how far the people of Syria would support him\. When he succeeded in making them his supporters by rousing them to avenge Othman’s blood, he consulted with his brother Utbah ibn Abu Sufyan\. He suggested, “If in this matter \`Amr ibn As was associated, he would solve most of the difficulties through his sagacity, but he would not be easily prepared to stabilize your authority unless he got the price which he desired for it\. If you are ready for this, he would prove the best counselor and helper\.” Mu\`awiyah liked this suggestion, sent for \`Amr ibn As and discussed with him and eventually it was settled that he would avenge Othman’s blood by holding Amir al\-Mu’minin n \(x\) liable for it in exchange for the governorship of

**Exhorting People for Jihad**

Now then, surely Jihad is one of the doors to Paradise, which Allah has opened for His chief friends\. It is the outfit of piety and the protective armor of Allah and His trustworthy shield\. Whoever abandons it Allah covers him with the outfit of disgrace and the clothe s of distress\. He is kicked with contempt and scorn and his heart is veiled with screens \(of neglect\)\. Truth is taken away from him because of missing jihad\. He has to suffer ignominy and justice is denied to him\.

Beware\! I called you \(insistently\) to fight these people night and day, secretly and openly and exhorted you to attack them before they attacked you because by Allah, no people have been attacked in the hearts of their houses but they suffered disgrace\. But you put it off for others and forsook it till destruction befell you and your cities were occupied\. The horsemen of Banu Ghamid 1 have reached al\-Anbar and killed Hassan ibn Hassan al\-Bakri\. They have removed your horsemen from the garrison\.

I have come to know that everyone of them entered upon Muslim women and other women under the protection of Islam and took away their ornaments from their legs, arms, necks and ears\. No woman could resist it except by pronouncing the verse, AWe are from Allah and to Him we shall return\. \(Holy Quran, 2: 156\) Then they returned, laden with wealth, without any wound or loss of life\. If any Muslim dies of grief after all this he is not to be blamed but rather there is justification for him before me\.

How strange\! How strange\! By Allah\! My heart sinks to see the unity of these people in their wrong \-doings and your dispersion from the right\. May woe and grief befall you\. You have become the target at which arrows are shot\. You are being killed and you do not kill\. You are being attacked but you do not attack\. Allah is being disobeyed and you remain agreeable to it\. When I ask you to move against them in the summer you say it is hot weather, spare us until the heat subsides from us\. When I order you to march in winter you say it is severely cold; give us time until the cold clears from us\. These are just excuses of evading heat or cold

Egypt, and by whatever means possible, he would not let Mu\`awiyah’s authority in Syria endure\. Consequently, both of them fulfilled the agreement and kept their words\.

<a id="page397"></a>because if you run away from heat and cold, you would be, by Allah, running away \(in a greater degree\) from the sword \(war\)\.

O you semblance of men, not men, your intelligence is that of children and your wit is that of the occupants of the curtained canopies \(women kept in seclusion from the outside world\)\. I wish I had not seen you nor known you\. By Allah, this acquaintance has brought about shame and resulted in repentance\. May Allah fight you\! You have filled my heart with puss and loaded my bosom with rage\. You made me drink mouthful after mouthful of grief\. You shattered my counsel by disobeying and leaving me so much so that Quraish started saying that the son of Abu Talib is brave but does not know \(tactics of\) war\. Allah bless them\! Is any one of them more fierce in war and more older in it than I am? I rose for it although yet within my twenties and here I am, have crossed over sixty, but one who is not obeyed can have no opinion\.

After the battle of Siffin, Mu\`awiyah had spread killing and bloodshed all around and started encroachments on cities within Amir al\-Mu’minin’s domain\. In this connection he duped Sufyan ibn Awf al\-Ghamidi with a force of six thousand to attack Hit, al\-Anbar and al\-Mada’in\. First he reached al \-Mada’in but finding it deserted proceeded to al\-Anbar\. Here a contingent of five hundred soldiers was posted as guard from Amir al\-Mu’minin’s side, but it could not resist the fierce army of Mu\`awiyah\. Only a hundred men stuck to their status and they faced them as stoutly as they could\. But, collecting together, the enemy’s force made such a severe attack that they too could no more resist and the chief of the contingent, Hassan ibn Hassan al\-Bakri was killed along with thirty others\. When the battlefield was clear the enemy ransacked al\-Anbar with total freedom and left the city completely destroyed\.

When Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) got the news of this attack, he

ascended the pulpit and exhorted the people for crushing the enemy and called them to jihad\. Yet, from no quarter was there any voice or response\. He alighted from the pulpit utterly disgusted and worried and in the same condition set off for the enemy on foot\. When people observed this their sense of self\-respect and shame was also awakened and they too followed him\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) stopped at an\-Nukhayla\. People then

surrounded him and insisted that he return as they had enough to face the enemy\. When their insistence increased beyond reckoning, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) consented to return and Sa’id ibn Qays al\-Hamdani

proceeded forward with a force of eight thousand\. But Sufyan ibn Awf al\-Ghamidi had gone, so Sa’id came back without any encounter\. When

<a id="page398"></a>Sa’id reached Kufa then \- according to the version of Ibn Abu’ Hadid \- Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) was so deeply grieved and indisposed during those

days to an extent of not wishing to enter the mosque\. He instead sat in the corridor of his residence \(that connects the entrance of the mosque\) and wrote this sermon for the people but gave it to his slave Sa\`d to read for them\. But al\-Mubarrad \(Al\-Kamil, Vol\. 1, pp\. 104\-107\) has related from \`Ubaydullah ibn Hafs al\-Taymi, Ibn Aisha, that Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)

delivered this sermon on a high place in an\-Nukhayla\. Ibn Maytham has held this as a preferable view\.

**Sermon 28**

**About the Transient Nature of this World and the Importance of the next World**

So now, surely this world has turned its back and announced its departure while the next world has appeared forward and proclaimed its approach\. Today is the day of preparation while tomorrow is the day of race\. The place to proceed to is Paradise while the place of doom is Hell\. Is there no one to offer repentance over his faults before his death? Or is there no one to perform virtuous acts before the day of trial?

Beware, surely you are in the days of hopes behind which stands death\. Whoever acts during the days of his hope before the approach of his death, his action would benefit him and his death would not harm him\. But he who fails to act during the period of hope before the approach of death, his action is a loss and his death will harm him\. Beware and act during a period of attraction just as you act during a period of dread\. Beware, surely I have not seen one who covets Paradise asleep nor dreads Hell to be asleep\. Beware, he whom right does not benefit must suffer the harm of the wrong and he whom guidance does not keep firm will be led away by misguidance towards destruction\.

Beware, you have been ordered insistently to march and have been guided as how to provide for the journey\. Surely the most frightening thing which I am afraid of about you is to follow desires and to widen the hopes\. Provide for yourself from this world what would save you tomorrow \(on the Day of Judgement\)\.

Sayyid ar\- Radi says the following: “If there could be an utterance which would drag the neck towards renunciation in this world and force action for the next world, it is this sermon\. It is enough to cut one off from

<a id="page399"></a>the entanglements of hopes and to ignite the flames of preaching \(for virtue\) and warning \(against vice\)\. His most wonderful words in this sermon are: \`Today is the day of preparation, while tomorrow is the day of race\.’ The place to proceed to is Paradise while the place of doom is Hell\.’ Besides the sublimity of these words, the greatness of their meaning, the true similes and factual illustrations, there are wonderful secrets and delicate implications the rein\.”

It is his saying that his place to proceed to is Paradise while the place of doom is Hell\. Here he has used two different words to convey two different meanings\. For Paradise he has used the expression “place to proceed to” but for Hell this word has not been used\. One proceeds to a place which he likes and desires and this can be true for Paradise only\. Hell does not have the attractiveness that it may be liked or proceeded to\. We seek Allah’s protection from it\. Since for Hell it was not proper to say Ato be proceeded to Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) employed the word doom,

implying the last place of stay where one reaches even though it may mean grief and worry or happiness and pleasure\.

This word is capable of conveying both senses\. However, it should be taken in the sense of al\-masir or al\-ma’al, that is, the last resort\. Quranic verse is “Say: Enjoy you \(your pleasures for a while\), for your last resort is into \(hell\) fire” \(Quran, 14: 30\)\. Here, to say sabqatakum, that is, “the place for you to proceed to,” in place of the word “masirakum,” that is, your doom or last resort would not be proper in any way\. Think and ponder over it and see how wondrous is its inner implication and how far its depth goes with beauty\. Amir al\-Mu’minin’s utterance is generally on these lines\. In some versions the word sabqah is shown as subqah, which is applied to a reward fixed for the winner in a race\. However, both meanings are close to each other because a reward is not for an undesirable action but for a good and commendable performance\.

**About Those Who Found Pretexts at the Time of Jihad**

O people\! Your bodies are together but your desires are divergent\. Your talk softens the hard stones and your action attracts your enemy towards you\. You claim in your sittings that you would do this and that, but when fighting approaches, you say \(to war\), “turn away” \(i\.e\. flee away\)\. If one calls you \(for help\), the call receives no heed\. And he

<a id="page400"></a>who deals harshly with you his heart has no solace\. The excuses are amiss like that of a debtor unwilling to pay\. The ignoble cannot ward off oppression\. Right cannot be achieved without effort\. Which is the house besides this one to protect? And with which leader \(Imam\) would you go for fighting after me?

By Allah\! deceived is one whom you have deceived while, by Allah, he who is successful with you receives only useless arrows\! You are like broken arrows thrown over the enemy\. By Allah\! I am now in the status that I neither confirm your views nor hope for your support, nor challenge the enemy through you\. What is the matter with you? What is your ailment? What is your cure? the other party is also men of your shape \(but they are so different in character\)\. Will there be talk without action, carelessness without piety and greed in things not right?131

**Disclosing Real Facts about the Assassination of Othman Ibn Affan, Amir Al\-Mu’minin \(x\) Said:**

If I had ordered his assassination I should have been his killer, but if I had refrained others from killing him I would have been his helper\.

131After the battle of Nahrawan, Mu\`awiyah sent ad\-Dahhak ibn Qays al\-Fihri with a force of four thousand towards Kufa with the purpose that he should create disorder in the area, killing whomever he found and keeping them busy with bloodshed and destruction so that Amir al\-Mu’minan \(x\) should find no rest or

peace of mind\. He set off for the achievement of this aim and shedding innocent blood and spreading destruction all around reached the way up to the place of ath\-Tha\`labiyya\. He attacked a caravan of pilgrims \(to Mecca\) and looted all their wealth and belongings\. Then at al\-Qutqutana, he killed the nephew of Abdullah ibn Mas\`ud, the Holy Prophet’s companion, namely Amr ibn Uways ibn Mas\`ud together with his followers\. In this manner he created havoc and bloodshed all around\. When Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) came to know of this wreck and ruin he called

his men to battle in order to put a stop to this vandalism, but people seemed to avoid war\. Being disgusted with their lethargy and lack of enthusiasm he ascended the pulpit and delivered this sermon\. He roused the men to feel shame and not to try and avoid war but to rise for the protection of their country like brave men without employing wrong and lame excuses\. At last, Hijr ibn Adiy al\-Kindi rose with a force of four thousand for crushing the enemy and overtook them at Tadmur\. Only a small encounter has taken place between the parties when night came on and they fled with only nineteen killed on their side\. In Amir al\-Mu’minin’s army, two persons fell as martyrs\.

<a id="page401"></a>The status was that he who helped him cannot now say that he is better than the one who deserted him while he who deserted him cannot say that he is better than the one who helped him\. I am putting before you his case\. He appropriated \(wealth\) and did it badly\. You protested against it and committed excess the rein\. With Allah lies the real verdict between the one who appropriates and that who protests\.

Othman is the first Umayyad Caliph of Islam who ascended the Caliphate on the 1st of Muharram, 24 A\.H\. at the age of seventy\. After having wielded full control and authority over the affairs of the Muslims for twelve years, he was killed at their hands on the 18th of Dhul\-Hijja, 35 A\.H\. And was buried at Hashsh Kawkab\.

One fact cannot be denied: Othman’s killing was the result of his own weaknesses and the black misdeeds of the officers he appointed; otherwise, there is no reason that Muslims should have unanimously agreed on killing him while no one except a few of his own house stood up to support and defend him\. Muslims would have certainly given consideration to his age, seniority, prestige and distinction of companionship of the Prophet \(h\) but his ways and deeds had so marred

the atmosphere that no one seemed prepared to sympathize and side with him\. The oppression and excesses perpetrated on the high\-ranking companions of the Prophet \(h\) had roused a wave of grief and anger

among the Arab tribes\. Everyone was infuriated and looked at his haughtiness and wrong doings with disdainful eyes\. Thus, due to Abu Dharr’s disgrace, dishonor and the externment of Banu Ghifar and their associate tribes, due to Abdullah ibn Mas\`ud’s merciless beating of Banu Hudhayl and their associates, due to the breaking of the ribs of Ammar ibn Yasir Banu Makhzum and their associates Banu Zuhrah and due to the plot for the killing of Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr, Banu Taym all had a storm of rage in their hearts\. The Muslims of other cities were also brimful of complaints at the hands of his officers, who under the intoxication of wealth and the effects of luxury did whatever they wished and crushed whomever they wanted\. They had no fear of punishment from the center nor apprehension of any enquiry\. People were fluttering to get out of their talons of oppression but no one was ready to listen to their cries of pain and restlessness\. Feelings of hatred were rising but no care was taken to put them down\. The companions of the Prophet \(h\) were

also sick of him as they saw that peace was destroyed, the administration was topsy\-turvy and Islam’s features were being metamorphosed\. The poor and the starving were craving for dried crusts while Banu Umayyah were rolling in wealth\. The Caliphate had become a handle for belly\-

<a id="page402"></a>filling and a means of amassing wealth\. Consequently, they too did not lag behind in preparing the ground for killing him\. Rather, it was at their letters and messages that people from Kufa, Basra and Egypt had collected in Medina\. Observing this behavior of the people of Medina, Othman wrote Mu\`awiyah saying, “So now, certainly the people of Medina have turned heretics, have turned faith against obedience and broken the \(oath of\) allegiance\. Send me the warriors of Syria on brisk and sturdy horses\.”

The policy adopted by Mu\`awiyah on receipt of this letter also throws light on the condition of the companions\. Al \-Tabari, the renown historian, writes the following after this: “When the letter reached Mu\`awiyah he pondered over it and considered it bad to openly oppose the companions of the Prophet \(h\) since he was aware of their unanimity\.”

In view of these circumstances to regard the killing of Othman as a consequence of timely enthusiasm and temporary feelings and to hurl it at some insurgents is to veil the fact, since all the factors of his opposition existed within Medina itself, while those coming from without had collected for seeking redress of their grievances at their call\. Their aim was only improvement of the status, not killing or bloodshed\. If their complaints had been heard then an occasion for this bloodshed would not have arisen\. What happened was that when, having been disgusted with the oppression and excesses of \`Abdullah ibn Sa\`d ibn Abu Sahr who was foster brother of Othman, the people of Egypt proceeded towards Medina and camped in the valley of Dhakhushub near the city\. They sent a man with a letter to Othman and demanded that oppression should stop, the existing ways should be changed and repentance should be offered for the future\. But instead of giving a reply, Othman turned these men out of the house and did not consider their demands worthy of any attention\.

The people entered the city to raise their voice against this pride and haughtiness and complained to the people of this behavior besides other excesses\. On the other side many people from Kufa and Basra had also arrived with their complaints\. After joining with the se, together they proceeded forward with the additional backing of the people of Medina and confined Othman within his house, although there was no restriction on his going and coming to the mosque\. But in his sermon on the very first Friday he severely rebuked these people and even held them accursed, whereupon people got infuriated and threw pebbles at him\. As a result, he lost control and fell from the pulpit\. After a few days, his coming and going to the mosque was also banned\.

<a id="page403"></a>When Othman saw matters deteriorating to this extent he implored Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) very submissively to find some way for his rescue and to disperse the people in whatever way he could\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) said, “On what terms can I ask them to leave when their

demands are justified? Othman said, “I authorize you in this matter\.

Whatever terms you would settle with them I would be bound by them\.

So Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) went and met the Egyptians and talked to them\.

They consented to return on the condition that all the tyrannies should be wiped out and Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr made governor by removing ibn Abu Sahr\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) came back and put their demand before Othman who accepted it without any hesitation and said that to get over these excesses, time was required\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) pointed out that

for matters concerning Medina delay had no sense\. However, for other places so much time could be allowed that the Caliph’s message could reach them\. Othman insisted that three days were also needed for Medina\. After discussion with the Egyptians, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) agreed to it

also and took all the responsibility thereof upon himself\. Then they dispersed at his suggestion\. Some of them went to Egypt with Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr while some went to the valley of Dhakhushub and stayed there until this whole matter ended\. On the second day of this event, Marwan ibn al\-Hakam said to Othman, AIt is good, these people have gone, but to stop people coming from other cities you should issue a statement so that they should not come this way, but sit quiet at their places\. That statement should be that some people collected in Medina after hearing some irresponsible talk but when they came to know that whatever they heard was wrong they were satisfied and have gone back\. Othman did not want to speak such a clear lie but Marwan canvassed him, so he agreed\. Speaking in the Holy Prophet’s Mosque, he said, “These Egyptians had received some reports about their caliph, and when satisfied that they were all baseless and wrong, they went back to their cities\.”

No sooner had he said this when there was a great deal of mourning at the mosque, and people began to shout to Othman: “Repent\! Fear Allah\! What is this lie you are uttering?\!” Othman was confused in this commotion and had to offer repentance\. Consequently, he turned to the Ka\`ba, moaned in the audience of Allah and returned home\.

Probably after this very event, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) advised Othman saying, “You should openly offer repentance about your past

<a id="page404"></a>misdeeds so that these uprisings should subside for good\. Otherwise, if tomorrow people of some other places come, you will again cling to my neck to rid you of them\.” Consequently, Othman delivered a speech at the Prophet’s Mosque wherein he admitted his mistakes, offering repentance and swearing to remain careful in future\. He told the people that when he stepped down from the pulpit that their representatives should meet him and he would remove their grievances and meet their demands\. On this people acclaimed this action of his and washed away their ill\-feelings with tears to a great extent\.

When Othman reached his house, Marwan sought permission to say something, but Othman’s wife Na’ila daughter of Qarafisah intervened\. Turning to Marwan, she said, “For Allah’s sake, you keep quiet\. You will surely say only such a thing as will bring nothing but death to him\.” Marwan felt offended and retorted, “You have no right to interfere in these matters\. You are the daughter of that very person who did not know till his death how to perform his ablution\.” Na’ila replied with fury, “You are wrong and are laying a false blame\. Before uttering anything about my father, you should have cast a glance on the features of your own father\. But had it not been for my consideration for that old man, I would have spoken things at which people would have shuddered yet would have confirmed every word\.” When Othman saw how the conversation between his cousin and wife was getting prolonged and nasty, he stopped them and asked Marwan to tell him what he wished\. Marwan said, “What is it with you saying at the mosque what you said, and what repentance have you offered?\! In my view, sticking to the sin was a thousand times better than such repentance because no matter how great the sins might have been, they may multiply there, and there is always room for repentance still, but repentance by force is no repentance at all\. You have said what you have, but now see the consequences of this open announcement: The crowds of people are now at your door\. Now go forward and fulfil their demands\.” Othman then said, “Well, I have said what I have said\. Now you must deal with these people\. It is not in my power to deal with them\.” Consequently, finding out his implied consent, Marwan came out and addressing the people spoke out thus: “Why have you assembled here? Do you intend to attack or to ransack? Remember, you cannot easily snatch away power from our hands, take that idea out from your hearts that you would subdue us\. We are not to be subdued by anyone\. Take away your black faces from here\. Allah may disgrace and dishonor you\.”

When people noticed this changed countenance and altered picture, they rose from there full of anger and rage and went straight to

<a id="page405"></a>Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) and related to him the whole story\. On hearing it, mir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) was infuriated and immediately went to Othman and

said to him, “Good Heavens\! How badly you have behaved with the Muslims\! You have forsaken faith for the sake of a faithless and characterless man and have lost all wit\. At least you should have regard and consideration for your own promise\. What is this that at Marwan’s beckoning you have set off with your eyes folded? Remember this: He will throw you in such a dark well from which you will never be able to come out\. You have become the like a beast of burden for Marwan, so he can now ride on you as he pleases and put you on whatever wrong way he wishes\. In the future, I shall never intervene in your affairs, nor shall I tell people anything\. Now you should manage your affairs on your own\.”

Saying all this, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) got back, and when Na’ila

got the chance, she said to Othman, “Did I not tell you to get rid of Marwan or else he would put such a stain on you that it would not be removed despite all your efforts? Well, what is the good in following the words of one who is without any respect among the people and is held low before their eyes? Make Ali agree; otherwise, remember that restoring the disturbed state of affairs is neither within your power nor in that of Marwan\.” Othman was impressed by this statement, so he sent a man after Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\), but the Imam \(x\) refused to meet with

Othman\. There was no siege around Othman, but shame deterred him\. With what face could he come out of the house? But there was no way without coming out\. Consequently, he came out quietly in the gloom of night and reaching Amir al\-Mu’minin’s place, he moaned his helplessness and loneliness, offered excuses and also assured him of keeping promises but Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) said, “You make a promise in the Prophet’s

Mosque standing before all the people but it is fulfilled in this way that when people go to you they are rebuked and even abuses are hurled at them\. When this is the state of your undertakings which the world has seen, then how and on what grounds can I trust any word of yours in the future\. Do not have any expectation from me now\. I am not prepared to accept any responsibility on your behalf\. The tracks are open before you\. Adopt whichever way you like and tread whatever track you choose\.” After this talk, Othman came back and began blaming Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) in retort to the effect that all the disturbances were rising at his

instance and that he was not doing anything despite being able to do everything\.

<a id="page406"></a>On this side, the result of repentance was as it was\. Now let us see the other side\. When after crossing the border of Hijaz, Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr reached the place Aylah on the coast of the red Sea people caught sight of a camel rider who was making his camel run so fast as though the enemy was chasing him\. These people had some misgivings about him and, therefore, called him and inquired as to who he was\. He said he was the slave of Othman\. They inquired as to where he was bound\. He said Egypt\. They inquired to whom he was going\. He replied to the Governor of Egypt\. People said that the Governor of Egypt was with them\. To whom was he going then? He said he was to go to ibn Abu Sahr\. People asked him if any letter was with him\. He denied\. They asked for what purpose he was going\. He said he did not know that\. One of these people thought that his clothe s should be searched\. So the search was made, but nothing was found on him\. Kinanah ibn Bishr at\-Tujibi said, “See his water\-skin\.” People said, “Leave him, how can there be a letter in the water?\!” Kinanah said, “You do not know what cunning these people play\.” Consequently, the water\-skin was opened and seen\. There was a lead pipe in it wherein was a letter\. When it was opened and read, the Caliph’s order in it was that: “When Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr and his party reach you, then from among them kill so\-and\-so, arrest so\-and\-so, and put\- so\-and so in jail\. But you must remain at your post\.” On reading this, all were stunned and thus began to look at one another in astonishment\. As a Persian axiom says, “Mind was just burst in astonishment as to what wonder it was\!”

Those proceeding forward were riding into the mouth of death, consequently they returned to Medna taking the slave with them\. Reaching there they placed that letter before all the companions of the Prophet \(h\)\. Whoever heard this incident remained stunned with

astonishment and there was no one who was not abusing Othman\. Afterwards a few companions went to Othman along with these people and asked whose seal was there on this letter\. He replied that it was his own\. They inquired whose writing it was\. He said it was his secretary’s\. They inquired whose slave was that man\. He replied that it was his\. They inquired whose riding beast it was\. He replied that it was that of the Government\. They inquired who had sent it\. He said he had no knowledge of it\. People then said, “Good Heavens\! Everything is yours, but you do not know who had sent it\. If you are so helpless, you must leave this Caliphate and get away from it so that such a man can come who can administer the affairs of the Muslims\.” He replied, “It is not possible that I should put off the outfit of Caliphate which Allah has put on me\. Of course, I would offer repentance\.” People said, “Why should you speak of

<a id="page407"></a>repentance which has already been flouted on the day when Marwan was representing you on your door and whatever was wanting has been made up by this letter\. Now we are not going to be duped into these bluffs\. Leave the Caliphate, and if our brethren stand in our way we will hold them up; but if they prepare for fighting we too will fight\. Neither our hands are stiff nor our swords blunt\. If you regard all Muslims equally, if you uphold justice, hand over Marwan and enable us to inquire from him on whose strength and support he wanted to play with the precious lives of Muslims by writing this letter\.” But Othman rejected this demand, refusing to hand over Marwan to them, whereupon people said that the letter had been written at his behest\.

However, improving conditions again deteriorated and they ought to have deteriorated because despite lapse of the required time everything was just as it had been and not a jot of difference had occurred\. Consequently, the people who had stayed behind in the valley of Dhakhushub to watch the result of repentance again advanced like a flood and spread over the streets of Medina and closing the borders from every side, surrounded his house\.

During these days of siege a companion of the Prophet \(h\),

Niyar ibn AIyad, desired to talk to Othman, went to his house and called him\. When he peeped out from the above he said, “O Othman, for Allah’s sake give up this Caliphate and save the Muslims from this bloodshed\. While he was just conversing, one of Othman’s men aimed at him with an arrow and killed him, whereupon people were infuriated and shouted that Niyar’s killer should be handed over to them\. Othman said it was not possible that he would hand over his own support to them\. This stubbornness worked like a fan on fire and in the height of fury people set fire to his door and began advancing\. When Marwan ibn al\-Hakam, Sa\`id ibn al\-As and Mughirah ibn al\-Akhnas together with their contingents pounced upon the besiegers, killing and bloodshed started at his door\. People wanted to enter the house but they were being pushed back\. In the meanwhile, Amr ibn Hazm al \-Ansari whose house was adjacent to that of Othman opened his door and shouted for advancing from that side\. Thus through this house the besiegers climbed on the roof of Othman’s house and descended down from the re, drawing their swords\. Only a few scuffles had taken place when all except the people of Othman’s house, his well\-wishers and Banu Umayyah ran away in the streets of Medina and a few hid themselves in the house of Umm Habiba daughter of Abu Sufyan, sister of Mu\`awiyah\. The rest were killed with Othman as the latter kept defending himself to the last \(Al\-Tabaqat, Ibn Sa\`d, Vol\. 3,

<a id="page408"></a>Part 1, pp\. 50\-58; Tabari, Vol\. 1, pp\. 2998\-3025; Al\-Kamil, Ibn al\-Athir, Vol\. 3, pp\. 167\-180; Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 2, pp\. 144\-161\)\.

At his killing, several poets wrote eulogies\. A couplet from the elegy by Abu Hurayra is presented:

Today people have only one grief, but I have two:

The loss of my money bag and the killing of Othman\.

After observing these events, the status of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)

became clear, namely that he was neither supporting the group that was instigating Othman’s killing nor could he be included among those who stood for his support and defense\. Rather, when he saw that what was said was not acted upon he kept aloof\.

When both parties are looked at among the people who had raised their hands from Othman’s support, Aisha is seen as one\. And according to the popular versions \(which are not right\), the then living persons out of the ten pre\-informed ones \(who had been pre\-informed in this world by the Prophet \(h\) as being admitted into Paradise\), out of those who took

part in the consultative committee \(formed for Othman’s selection for caliphate\) Ansar, original Muhajirun, people who took part in the battle of Badr and other conspicuous and dignified individuals, while on the side \(of Othman\) are seen only a few slaves of the Caliph and a few individuals from Banu Umayyah\. If people like Marwan and Sa’id ibn al\-As cannot be given precedence over the original Muhajirun, their actions, too, cannot be given precedence over the actions of the latter\. Again, if ijma’ \(consensus of opinion\) is not meant for particular occasions\.\.\. only then it would be difficult to question this overwhelming unanimity of the companions\.

**Sermon 31**

**Delivered Before the Commencement of the Battle of Jamal**

Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) sent Abdullah ibn Abbas to az\-Zubayr ibn

al\-Awwam with the purpose that he should advise him to obey\. He said the following to him on that occasion:

Do not meet Talhah \(ibn Ubaydillah\)\. If you meet him you will find him like an unruly bull whose horns are turned towards its ears\. He rides a ferocious riding beast and says it has been tamed\. Instead, meet with az\-Zubayr because he is soft\-tempered\. Tell him that your maternal

<a id="page409"></a>cousin says that, A\(It looks as if\) in the Hijaz you knew me \(accepted me\), but \(on coming here to\) Iraq you do not know me \(do not accept me\)\. So, what has dissuaded \(you\) from what was shown \(by you previously\)?

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “The last sentence of this sermon, i\.e\. Fama \`ada minna bada, has been heard only from Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)\.”

**Sermon 32**

**About the Disparagement of the World and Categories of its**

**People**

O people\! We have been born in such a wrongful and thankless period wherein the virtuous is deemed vicious and the oppressor goes on advancing in his excess\. We do not make use of what we know and do not discover what we do not know\. We do not fear calamity till it befalls\.

People are of four categories\. Among them is one who is prevented from mischief only by his low status, lack of means and paucity of wealth\.

Then there is he who has drawn his sword, openly commits mischief, has collected his horsemen and foot\-man and has devoted himself to securing wealth, leading troops, rising on the pulpit and has allowed his faith to perish\. How bad is the transaction that you allow, \(enjoyment of\) this world to be a price for yourself as an alternative for what there is with Allah for you\.

And among them is he who seeks \(benefits of\) this world through actions meant for the next world, but does not seek \(good of\) the next world through actions of this world\. He keeps his body calm \(in dignity\), raises small steps, holds up his clothe s, embellishes his body for appearance of trust\-worthiness and uses the status of Allah’s connivance as a means of committing sins\.

Then there is one whose weakness and lack of means have held him back from conquest of lands\. This keeps down his status and he has named it contentment and he clothe s himself with the robe of renunciation although he has never had any connection with these qualities\.

<a id="page410"></a>Then there remain a few people in whose case the remembrance of their return \(to Allah on the Last Day\) keeps their eyes bent and the fear of resurrection moves their tears\. Some of them are scared away \(from the world\) and dispersed\. Some are frightened and subdued; some are quiet as if muzzled; some are praying sincerely\. Some are grief\-stricken and pain\-ridden whom fear has confined to namelessness and disgrace has shrouded them, so they are in \(The sea of\) bitter water\. Their mouths are closed and their hearts are bruised\. They preached till they were tired, they were oppressed till they were disgraced and they were killed till they remained few in number\.

The world in your eyes should be smaller than the bark of the acacia and the clippings of wool\. Seek instruction from those who preceded you before those who follow you take instruction from you and keep aloof from it realizing its evil because it cuts off even from those who were more attached to it than you\.

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “Some ignorant persons attributed this sermon to Mu\`awiyah but it is the speech of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)\. There should be no doubt about it\. What comparison is

there between gold and clay or sweet and bitter water\.” This has been pointed out by the skillful guide and the expert critic \`Amr ibn Bahr al\-Jahiz as he has mentioned this sermon in his book, Al\-Bayan wal\-Tbyin \(Vol\. 2, pp\. 59\-61\)\. He has also mentioned who attributed it to Mu\`awiyah then states that it is most akin to be the speech of Ali and most in accord with his way of categorizing people and information about their oppression, disgrace, apprehension and fear\. \(On the other hand\) we never found Mu\`awiyah speaking on the lives of those who renounce this world or worshippers\.

**Sermon 33**

**Abdullah ibn Abbas says that when Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) set**

**out to fight the people of Basra, he came to his audience at Thi\-Qar and saw that Abdullah \[ibn Abbas\] was stitching his shoe\. Then Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) said to me, “What is the price of this shoe?” I said:**

**“It has no value now\.” He then said, “By Allah\! It should have been more dear to me than ruling over you except for the fact that I have established right and warded off wrong\.” Then the Imam \(x\) came out and spoke thus:**

<a id="page411"></a>Verily, Allah sent Muhammad \(h\) when none among the Arabs

read a book or claimed Prophethood\. He guided the people till he took them to their \(correct\) status and their salvation and their spears \(ie\. officers\) became straight and their conditions settled down\.

By Allah, surely I was in their lead till it took shape with its walls\. I did not show weakness or cowardice\. My existing march is also like that\. I shall certainly pierce the wrong till right comes out of its side\.

What \(cause of conflict\) is there between the tribesmen of Quraish and me? By Allah, I have fought them when they were unbelievers and I shall fight them when they have been misled\. I shall be the same for them today as I was for them yesterday\.

By Allah, the tribesmen of Quraish only take revenge against us because Allah has given us \(i\.e\. The Holy Prophet \(h\) and his progeny\)

preference over them\. So, we have allowed them into our domain, whereupon they have become as the former poet says the following:

By my life, you continued drinking fresh milk every morning, And \(continued\) eating fine stoned dates with butter;

We have given you the nobility which you did not possess before; And surrounded \(protected\) you with thoroughbred horses and tawny colored spears \(strong spears\)\.

The fact is that the poet’s aim here is to say that the condition of the addressee’s life, from the moral and material point of view, had been worse in the past and that the poet and his tribe had given him the best means of leading their lives\. But as the result of this improved condition the addressee has completely lost himself and forgotten his past condition and thinks that he had led this kind of life before\.

Now, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) wants to convey the same idea here to the tribesmen of Quraish as Fatima \(x\) the holy daughter of the Holy Prophet \(h\) said in her speech on Fadak:

\(O People\!\) You were on the brink of the pit of Hill Fire \(Holy Quran, 3: 103\)\. You were as worthless as themouthful of water\. You were of a minority like the handful of greedy and a spark of the hasty\. You were as down\-trodden as the dust under your feet\. You drank dirty water\.

<a id="page412"></a>You ate untanned skin\. You were abased and condemned\. But Allah has rescued you through my father Muhammad \(h\)\.

**Sermon 34**

**To Prepare the People for Fighting with the People of Syria \(Ash\-sham\) Amir Al\-Mu’minin \(x\) Said:**

Woe unto you\! I am tired of rebuking you\. Do you accept this worldly life in place of the next life? Or disgrace in place of dignity? When I invite you to fight your enemy your eyes revolve as though you are in the clutches of death and in the senselessness of last moments\. My pleadings are not understood by you and you remain stunned\. It is as though your hearts are affected with madness so that you do not understand\. You have lost my confidence for good\. Neither are you a support for me to lean upon nor a means to honor and victory\. Your example is that of the camels whose protector has disappeared, so that if they are collected from one side they disperse away from the other side\.

By Allah, how bad are you for igniting flames of war\. You are intrigued against but do not intrigue \(against the enemy\)\. Your boundaries are decreasing but you do not get enraged over it\. Those against you do not sleep but you are unmindful\. By Allah, those who leave matters one for the other are subdued\. By Allah, I believed about you that if battle rages and death hovers around you, you will cut away from son of Abu Talib like the severing of head from the trunk\.132

By Allah, he who makes it possible for his adversary to so overpower him as to remove the flesh \(from his bones\), crush his bones and cut his skin into pieces, then it means that his helplessness is great and that his heart surrounded within the sides of his chest is weak\. You may become like this if you wish\. But for me, before I allow it I shall use my sharp\-edged swords of al\-Mushrafiyyah which would cut under the bones of the head and cause arms and feet to fly\. Thereafter, Allah will do whatever He wills\.

132Ash\-Sham was a name used for a vast geographical area occupied by Muslims in those days\. This area included present\-day Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine\. Its capital was Damascus\. Wherever the word Syria is mentioned \(in this book\), it should be understood in its larger geographical context\.

<a id="page413"></a>O people\! I have a right over you and you have a right over me\. As for your right over me, that is to counsel you, to pay your dues fully, to teach you that you may not remain ignorant and instruct you in acceptable behavior that you may act upon\. As for my right over you, it is fulfillment of \(the obligation of\) allegiance, well\-wishing in presence or in absence, response when I call you and obedience when I order you\.133

**Sermon 35**

**Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) Delivered this Sermon after the Arbitration**

All praise is due to Allah even though time has brought \(to us\) crushing calamity and great occurrence\. And I testify that there is no god but Allah the One, there is no partner for Him nor is there with Him any god other than Himself and that Muhammad \(h\) is His slave and Prophet

\(h\)\.

133This sentence is employed for such severance after which there is no occasion or possibility of joining\. The author of _Al\-Durra al\-Najafiyya_ has quoted several views in its explanation:

i\. Ibn Durayd’s view is that it means that, AJust as when the head is severed its joining again is impossible\. In the same way as you will not join me after once deserting me\.

1. Al\-Mufaddal says _ar\-ra’s_ \(head\) was the name of a man and a village of Syria, _Bayt ar\-ra’s_ is named after him\. This man left his home and went away somewhere and never again returned to his village after which the proverb sprang up Ayou went as _ar\-ra’s_ had gone\.
2. One meaning of it is that “Just as if the joints of the bones of the head are opened, they cannot be restored, likewise, you will not rejoin me after cutting yourselves away from me\.”
3. It has also been said that this sentence is in the sense of separating completely\. After copying this meaning from the _Sharh_ of Shaikh Qutbud\-Dn ar\-Rawandi, the commentator Ibn Abul\-Hadd has written that this meaning is not correct because when the word _ar\-ra’s_ is used in this sense of whole it is not preceded by _alif_ and _lam_\.
4. It is also taken to mean that “You will so run away from me as one \(fleeing for life\) to save his head\. Besides this, one or two other meanings have also been stated but being remote they are disregarded\.”

First of all it was used by the philosopher of Arabia Aktham ibn Sayfi while teaching unity and concord to his children\. He says the following:

“O my children\! Do not cut away \(from each other\) at the time of calamities like the cutting of the head because after that you will never get together\.”

<a id="page414"></a>So now, certainly the disobedience of a sympathetic counselor who has knowledge as well as experience brings about disappointment and that results in repentance\. I had given you my orders about this arbitration and put before you my hidden view that if Qasir’s2 orders were fulfilled but you rejected it \(my orders\) like rough opponents and disobedient insurgents till the counselor himself fell in doubt about his counsel and the flint \(of his wit\) ceased to give flame\. Consequently, my status and yours became as the poet of Hawazin says the following:

I gave you my orders at Mun’arajil\- Liwa’ but you did not see the good of my counsel till the noon of next day \(when it was too late\)\.

When the Syrians’ spirit was broken by the bloody swords of the Iraqis and the incessant attacks of the night of al\-Harir lowered their morale and ended their aspirations, Amr ibn al\-As suggested to Mu\`awiyah the trick that the Holy Quran should be raised on spears and shouts urged forth to treat it as the arbitrator\. Its effect would be that some people would try to stop the war and others would like to continue it\. We would thus divide them and be able to get the war postponed for another occasion\. Consequently, copies of the Holy Quran were raised on spears\. The result was that some brainless persons raised hue and cry and created division and disturbance in the army and the efforts of simple Muslims turned slow after having been near victory\. Without understanding anything they began to shout that they should prefer the verdict of the Holy Quran over war\.

When Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) saw the Holy Quran being the instrument of their activities, he said:

O people\! Do not fall in this trap of deceit and trickery\. They are putting up this device only to escape the ignominy of defeat\. I know the character of each one of them\. They are neither adherents of the Holy Quran nor have they any connection with the faith or religion\. The very purpose of our fighting has been that they should follow the Holy Quran and act on its injunctions\. For Allah’s sake do not fall in their deceitful device\. Go ahead with determination and courage and stop only after vanquishing the dying foe\. Nevertheless, the deceitful instrument of wrong had worked\.

People took to disobedience and rebellion\. Mis\`ar ibn Fadaki at\-Tamimi and Zayd ibn Hussain at\-Ta’i, each with twenty thousand men, came forward and said to Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) “O Ali\! If you do not

<a id="page415"></a>respond to the call of the Holy Quran, we will deal with you in the same manner as we did with Othman\. You end the battle at once and bow before the verdict of the Holy Quran \[is issued against you\]\.” Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) tried his best to make them understand the trick, but Satan was standing before them pretending to wear the garb of the Holy Quran\. He did not allow them to do so and they compelled Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) that he should send someone to call Malik ibn al\-Harith al\-Ashtar from the battlefield\. Being obliged, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) sent Yazid ibn Hani

to call Malik back\. When Malik heard this order he was bewildered and said, “Please tell him this is not the occasion to leave the status\. He may wait a bit then I will come to his audience with the tidings of victory\. Hani conveyed this message on return but people shouted that Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) must have sent word to him secretly to continue\.” Amir al\-

Mu’minin \(x\) said he never got any occasion to send any secret message to him\. Whatever he said was said before them\. People said he should be sent again and that if Malik delayed his return Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) should forsake his life\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) again sent Yazid ibn Hani

and sent word that rebellion had occurred, he should return in whatever condition he was\. So Hani went and told Malik “You hold victory dear or the life of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)\. If his life is dear you should raise your hands from the battle and go to him\. Leaving the chances of victory Malik stood up and came to the audience of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) with grief

and disappointment\.” The Aws raged there\. He rebuked the people very much but matters had taken such a turn that they could not be corrected\.

It was then settled that either party should nominate an arbitrator so that they should settle the Caliphate matter according to the Holy Quran\. From Mu\`awiyah’s side \`Amr ibn al\-\`\}s was decided upon and from Amir al\-Mu’minin’s side people proposed the name of Abu Musa al\-Ash\`ari\. Seeing this wrong selection Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) said,

“Since you have not accepted my order about arbitration at least now agree that do not make Abu Musa the arbitrator\. He is not a man of trust\. Here is Abdullah ibn Abbas and here is Malik al\-Ashtar\. Select one of them\. But they did not listen to him and stuck to his name \(Abu Musa\)\.” Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) said, “Alright, do whatever you want\. The day is

not far when you will cut your own hands through your misdeeds\.”

After the nomination of arbitrators, when the deed of agreement was being written, the name of Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) was also written\. \`Amr ibn al\-As said, “This should be rubbed off\. If we regard Amir al\-

<a id="page416"></a>Mu’minin \(x\), why should this battle have been fought?” At first, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) refused to rub it off but when they did not in any way

agree, he rubbed it off and said, “This incident is just similar to the one at al\-Hudaybiya when the unbelievers stuck on the point that the words AProphet \(h\) of Allah’ with the name of the Prophet \(h\) should be

removed and the Prophet \(h\) did remove it\.” On this, Amr ibn al\-As got angry and said, “Do you treat us as unbelievers\.” Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)

asked, “On what day have you had anything to do with believers and when have you been their supporters?” However, after this settlement, the people dispersed and after mutual consultation these two arbitrators decided that by removing both Ali and Mu\`awiyah from the Caliphate the people should be accorded the power to choose whomever they desired\. When time came to its announcement there was a meeting at Dawmatul\-Jandal, a place between Iraq and Syria then the two arbitrators also reached there to announce the judgement on the fate of the Muslims\. Acting cunningly \`Amr ibn al \-\`\}s said to Abu Musa, “I regard it ill manner to precede you\. You are older in years and age; so, first you make the announcement yourself\.” Abu Musa succumbed to his flattery and came out proudly\. Standing before the gathering, he addressed them thus: “O Muslims\! We have jointly settled that Ali ibn Abu Talib and Mu\`awiyah should be removed and the right to choose a Caliph be accorded to the Muslims\. They should choose whomever they like\.” Saying this he sat down\. Now the turn was for \`Amr ibn al\-\` \}s and he said, “O Muslims\! You have heard that Abu Musa has removed \`Amr ibn Abu Talib; I also agree with it\. As for Mu\`awiyah, there is no question of removing him\. Therefore, I place him in his status\.” No sooner than he said this there were cries all around\. Abu Musa cried hoarse that it was a trick, a deceit and said to \`Amr ibn al\-As, “You have played a trick and your example is that of a dog on which if you load something he would gasp, or leave him, he would gasp\.” Amr ibn al\-As said, “Your example is like the ass on whom books are loaded\.” However, \`Amr ibn al\-\` \}s trick was effective and Mu\`awiyah’s shaking feet were again stabilized\.

The above is a short sketch of the Arbitration whose basis was laid in the Holy Quran and Sunnah\. But was it a verdict of the Holy Quran or the result of those deceitful contrivances which people of this world always employ to retain their authority? Could these pages of history be made a torch\-guide for the future and the Holy Quran and Sunnah not be used as a means of securing authority or as an instrument of worldly benefits?

<a id="page417"></a>When Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) got the news of this lamentable

result of arbitration, he climbed on the pulpit and delivered this sermon every word of which savors his grief and sorrow and at the same time it throws light on soundness of his thinking, correctness of his opinion and foresighted sagacity\.

A proverb is used in this sermon borrowed from an occasion where the advice of a counselor is rejected and afterwards it is repented\. The fact is that the ruler of Hira, namely Jazimah al\-Abrash, killed the ruler of Jazira, \`Amr ibn Zarib\. Thereafter, his daughter Zabba was made the ruler of Jazira\. Soon after accession to the throne, she thought out a plan to avenge her father’s blood\. Then she sent a message to Jazmah that she could not alone carry on the affairs of the state and that if he could become her patron by accepting her as his wife, she would be grateful\. Jazmah was more than puffed up at this marriage proposal and prepared himself to set off for Jazira with a thousand horsemen\. His slave, Qasir, advised him repeatedly that this was just a sign of deceit and trickery, and that he should not place himself in this danger, but his wit had been so blinded that he could not think over why Zabba should select the murderer of her father as her life’s companion\. He then set off and reached the border of Jazira\. Although Zabba’s army was present for his reception\. she neither gave any special reception nor offered him a warm welcome\. Seeing this state, Qasir was again suspicious; he advised Jazmah to get back, but nearness to the goal had further fanned his passion\. Jazimah paid no heed and, stepping further, entered the city\. Soon after his arrival, he was killed there then\. When Qasir saw this he said, “Had the advice of Qasir been followed\.\.\. etc\. Since then, this proverb gained currency\.”

The poet of Hawazin referred to in this sermon is Durayd ibn as\-Simmah\. He wrote the above\-cited couplet after the death of his brother Abdullah ibn as\-Simmah\. Its facts are that \`Abdullah, along with his brother, led an attack of two groups of Banu Jusham and Banu Nasr who were both from Hawazin and drove away many camels\. On return when they intended to rest at Mun\`arajil\-Liwa, Durayd said it was not advisable to stay there lest the enemy attacks from behind, but Abdullah did not agree and stayed the re\. The result was that as soon as dawn appeared the enemy attacked and killed \`Abdullah on the spot\. Durayd also received wounds but he slipped away alive and after this he wrote a few couplets out of which one couplet is this wherein he has referred to the destruction resulting from his advice having been rejected\.

**Warning the People of Nahrawan of Their Fate**

I am warning you that you will be killed on the bend of this canal and on the levee of this low area while you will have no clear excuse before Allah nor any open authority with you\. You have come out of your houses then the Divine decree entangled you\. I had advised you against this arbitration but you rejected my advice like adversaries and opponents till I turned my ideas in the direction of your wishes\. You are a group whose heads are devoid of wit and intelligence\. May you have no father\! \(Allah’s woe be to you\!\) I have not put you in any calamity nor wished you harm\.

The cause of the battle of Nahrawan dated back to the time following the arbitration when Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) was returning to

Kufa\. The people who were foremost in pleading acceptance of arbitration began to say that appointment of anyone other than Allah as arbitrator is heresy and that, Allah forbid, by accepting the arbitration Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) had become a heretic\. Consequently, by distorting the meaning of “There is no authority save with Allah they made simple Muslims share their view and separated from Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)

encamped at Hanira’ near Kafa\.” When Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) learned of

this plot, he sent Sa\`sa\`ah ibn Suhan al\-Abdi and Ziyad ibn an\- Nadr al\-Harithi in the company of Ibn Abbas toward them and afterwards he went to the place of their stay and dispersed them after discussion\.

When these people reached Kufa they began to spread thenews that Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) had broken the agreement of arbitration and that he was again ready to fight against the Syrians\. When Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) learned this, he contradicted it whereupon these people

stood up in rebellion and encamped twelve miles from Baghdad in the lowlands area of the canal called Nahrawan\.

On the other side, after hearing the verdict of arbitration Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) prepared to fight the army of Syria\. He wrote to the

Kharijites that the verdict passed by the two arbitrators in pursuance of their heart’s wishes instead of the Holy Quran and Sunnah was not acceptable to him and he, therefore, decided to fight with them and they should support him in crushing the enemy\. But the Kharijites gave him this reply, “When you had agreed to arbitration in our view you had

<a id="page419"></a>turned heretic\. Now if you admit your heresy and offer repentance we will think over this matter and decide what we should do\.” Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) understood from their reply that their disobedience and misguidance

had become very serious\. To entertain any kind of hope from them now was futile\. Consequently, ignoring them, he encamped in the valley of an\-Nukhaylah with a view to marching towards Syria\. When the army had been arrayed he came to know that the men desired to deal with the people of Nahrawan first and to move towards Syria afterwards\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\), however, said that they should be left as they were, that

they themselves should first move towards Syria while the people of Nahrawan could be dealt with afterwards\. People said that they were prepared to obey every order of his with all their might whether he moved this way or that way\. The army had not moved when news about the rebellion of Kharijites began to reach them\. Then it was learned that they had butchered the governor of Nahrawan,’Abdullah ibn Khabbab ibn al\-Aratt and his slave maid with the child in her womb and had killed three women of Banu Tay and Umm Sinan al\-Saydawi\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)

sent al\-Harith ibn Murrah al \-Abdi to investigate but he too was killed by them\. When their rebellion reached this stage it was necessary to deal with them\. Consequently, the army turned towards Nahrawan\. On reaching there Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) sent them word that those who had

killed Abdullah ibn Khabbab ibn al\-Aratt and innocent women should be handed over to him for avenging blood\. Those people replied that they had killed these persons jointly and that they considered it lawful to shed the blood of all the people on his side\. Even at this Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)

did not take the initiative for the battle, but sent Abu Ayyub al\-Ansari with a message of peace\. So he spoke to them aloud, “Whoever comes under this banner or separates from that party and goes to Kufa or al\-Mada’in would get amnesty and he would not be questioned\.” As a result of this, Farwah ibn Nawfal al\-Ashja\`i said that he did not know why they were at war with Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)\. Saying this, he separated along

with five hundred men\. Similarly, one group after another began to separate and some of them joined Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)\. Those who

remained numbered four thousand and according to al\-Tabari’s account they numbered two thousand eight hundred\. Yet, these people were not in any way prepared to listen to the voice of truth and were ready to kill or be killed\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) had stopped his men from taking the

initiative but the Kharijites put arrows in their bows and broke and threw away the sheathe s of their swords\. Even at this juncture Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) warned them of the dire consequences of war and this sermon is about that warning and admonition\. But they were brimming

<a id="page420"></a>with enthusiasm so much that they leapt on Amir al\-Mu’minin’s force all of a sudden\. This onslaught was so severe that the footmen lost ground but they soon fixed themselves so firmly that the attack of arrows and spears could not dislodge them from their status\. They soon cleared away the Kharijites that except for nine persons who fled to save their lives, not a single person was left alive\. From Amir al\-Mu’minin’s army only eight persons fell as martyrs\. The battle took place on the 9th Safar, 38 A\.H\.

**Sermon 37**

**Amir Al\-Mu’minin’s Utterance Which Runs like a Sermon about His Own Steadfastness in Religion and Precedence in \(Acceptance of\) Conviction\.**

I discharged duties when others lost courage \(to do so\) and I came forward when others hid themselves\. I spoke when others remained mum\. I struck with the Divine light when others remained standing\. I was the quietest of them in voice but the highest in going forward\. I cleaved to its rein and applied myself solely to its pledge, like the mountain which neither sweeping wind could move nor storm could shake\. No one could find fault with me nor could any speaker speak ill of me\.

The low is in my view worthy of honor till I secure \(his\) right for him while the strong is in my view weak till I take their \(assumed\) right from them\. We are happy with the destiny ordained by Allah and have submitted to the command of Allah\. Do you think I would speak lies about the Prophet of Allah \(k\)? By Allah, I am surely the first to testify

of him, so I will not be the first to falsify him\. I looked at my affairs and found that my obedience should have precedence over my allegiance while my pledge to him is a burden on my neck\.

**Sermon 38**

**About the Naming of Doubt as Such and Disparagement of**

**Those in Doubt**:

Doubt is named doubt because it resembles truth\. As for lovers of Allah, their conviction serves them as light and the direction of the right path \(itself\) serves as their guide; while the enemies of Allah, in time of doubt call to misguidance in the darkness of doubt and their guide is blindness \(of intelligence\)\. One who fears death cannot escape it nor one who fears for eternal life secure it\.

<a id="page421"></a>

**Sermon 39**

**In Disparagement of Those Who Shrink from Fighting**

I am faced with men who do not obey when I order and do not respond when I call them\. May you have no father \(Woe unto you\!\) What are you waiting for to rise in the cause of Allah? Does not faith join you together, or sense of shame rouse you? I stand among you shouting and I am calling you for help, but you do not listen to my word and do not obey my orders, till circumstances show their bad consequences\. No blood can be avenged through you and no purpose can be achieved with you\. I called you to help your brethren but \(instead\) you made noises like the camel having pain in the stomach and became loose like the camel with a thin back\. Then a wavering weak contingent came to me from among you: “as if they are being led to death and they are only watching134 \(Holy Quran, 8: 6\)\.

134Mu\`awiyah sent a contingent of two thousand soldiers under an\-Nu’m an ibn Bashir to assault Aynu’t\-Tamr\. This place was a defence base of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) near Kufa in which Malik ibn Ka\`b al\-Arhabi was in charge\.

Although there were a thousand combatants under him, at that moment, only a hundred men were present\. When Malik noticed the offensive force advancing, he wrote to Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) for help\. When Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) received the message he asked the people for his help but only three hundred men got ready\. As a result Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) was much disgusted and delivered this sermon in

their admonition\. When Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) reached his house after delivering

the sermon, Adiy ibn Hatim at\-Ta’i came and said, “O Amir a\-Mu’minin a thousand men of Banu Tayyi’ are under me\. If you say I shall send them off\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) said, “It does not look good that people of only one tribe should

meet the enemy\. You prepare your force in the Valley of an\-Nukhayla\. Accordingly, he went there and called people to _jihad_, where, besides Banu Tay, one thousand other combatants also assembled\. They were still preparing to set off when word reached from Malik ibn Ka\`b that there was no need for help as he had repulsed the enemy\.

The reason for this was that Malik had hastily sent \`Abdullah ibn Hawalah al\-Azdi off to Qarazah ibn Ka\`b al\-Ansari and Mikhnaf ibn Sulaym al\-Azdi, so that if there was delay in the arrival of support from Kufa he could get help from here in time\. Abdullah went to both, but got no help from Qarazah\. However, Mikhnaf ibn Sulaym had gotten fifty persons ready under Abd ar\-Rahman ibn Mikhnaf and they arrived near evening\. Until that time, the two thousand men \(of the enemy\) had not been able to subdue the hundred men of Malik\. When an\-Nu’man saw these fifty men he thought that their forces had started coming in so he fled from the

<a id="page422"></a>Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “Amir al\-Mu’minin’s word Amutadha’ib means Amudtarib \(i\.e\. moved or troubled\), as they say Atadha’ abat ar\-rih \(i\.e\. The winds blow in troubled manner\)\. Similarly the wolf is called Adhi’b because of its troubled movement\.

**Sermon 40**

**When Amir Al\-Mu’minin \(x\) Heard the Cry of Kharijites That Verdict Is Only That of Allah, He Said:**

The statement is right, but what \(they think\) it means is wrong\. It is true that verdict lies but with Allah, but these people say that \(the function of\) governance is only for Allah\. The fact is that there is no escape for men from rulers\_\_good or bad\. The faithful persons perform \(good\) acts in his rule while the unfaithful enjoys \(worldly\) benefits in it\. During the rule, Allah would carry everything to end\. Through the ruler tax is collected, the enemy is fought, roadways are protected and the right of the weak is taken from the strong till the virtuous enjoy peace and allowed protection from \(the oppression of\) the wicked\.

**Another version of the same sermon:**

When Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) heard the cry of the Khirijites on the

aforementioned verdict he said: “I am expecting the verdict \(destiny\) of Allah on you\. Then he went on to say, As for good government, the pious man performs good deeds in it, while in a bad government the wicked person enjoys till his time is over and death overtakes him\.

**Sermon 41**

**Condemning Treason**

O people\! Surely the fulfillment of a pledge is the twin of truth\. I do not know a better shield \(against the assaults of sin\) than it\. One who realizes the reality of return \(to the next world\) refuses \(submission to the dynamic of\) betrayal\. We are in a period when most of the people regard betrayal as wisdom\. In these days the ignorant call it excellence of cunning\. What is the matter with them? Allah may destroy them\. One

battlefield\. Even in their retreat, Malik attacked them from rear and killed three of their men\.

<a id="page423"></a>who has been through the thick and thin of life finds the excuses to be preventing him from acquiescing to the orders and prohibitions of Allah\. Yet he disregards them despite the capability \(to succumb to them and follows the commands of Allah\), while one who has no restraints of religion seizes the opportunity \(and accepts the excuses for not following the commands of Allah\)\.

**Sermon 42**

**About Heart’s Desires and Extended Hopes**

O people what I fear most about you are two things \- acting according to desires and the extending of hopes\. Acting according to \(personal\) desires prevents \(the experiential admission of\) truth; regarding extensive hope, it makes one forget the next world\. You should know this world is moving rapidly and nothing has remained out of it except the last particles like the dregs of a vessel which has been emptied by some one\. Beware, the next world is advancing and either of them has sons i\.e\. followers\. You should become sons of the next world and not become sons of this world because on the Day of Judgement every son would cling to his mother\. Today is the Day of action and there is no reckoning while tomorrow is the Day of reckoning wherein there would be no \(opportunity for\) action\.

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “Al\-hadhadha means rapid, but some people have read it jadhdha\. According to this version, the meaning, it could be that the cycle of worldly enjoyments would end soon\.

**Sermon 43**

**After Amir Al\-Mu’minin \(x\) Had Sent Jarir Ibn Abdillah Al\-**

**bajali to Mu\`awiyah \(For Securing His Oath of Allegiance\), Some of His Companions Suggested Preparation to Fight with Him\. Then He Said:**

My preparation for war with the people of Syria while Jarir ibn Abdillah al\-Bajali is still there would be closing the door on Syria and thereby preventing its people from a good action \(i\.e\. allegiance\) if that indeed was their intention\. However, I have fixed a time limit of Jarir after which he would not stay without either deception or in disobedience\.

<a id="page424"></a>My opinion is in favor of patience, so wait a while\. \(In the meantime\) I do not dislike your preparation\.

I have observed this matter thoroughly from all sides but I do not find any way except war or heresy\. Certainly, there was a ruler over the people \(before me\) who brought about new \(un\-Islamic\) things and compelled the people to speak out\. So they did speak, then rose and changed the whole system\.

**Sermon 44**

**Masqalah Ibn Hubayrah ash\-Shaybani Fled to Mu\`awiyah Because He Had Purchased Some Prisoners of BanÅ Najiyah from an Executive of Amir Al\-Mu’minin \(x\), but When He Demanded the**

**Price, the Latter Avoided and Ran to Syria\. Amir Al\-Mu’minin \(x\)**

**Said:**

May Masqalah be condemned\. He acted like the noble but fled like a slave\. Before his admirer could speak \(about him\) he silenced him and before his eulogist could testify to his good deeds he closed his mouth\. If he had stayed behind we would have taken from him what he could easily pay and waited for the balance till his money increased\.

Following the “arbitration”, the Kharijites rose in defiance\. A Kharijite man of Banu Najiyah named al\-Khirrit ibn Rashid an\- Naji began instigating people and set off towards al\-Mada’in with a group killing and marauding\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) sent Ziyad ibn Khasafah with three

hundred men to check him\. When the two forces met at al \-Mada’in they attacked each other with swords\. Only one encounter or so had taken place when the gloom of evening prevailed and the battle had to be stopped\. When morning appeared Ziyad’s men noticed that five dead bodies of the Kharijites were lying and they themselves had cleared off the battlefield\. Seeing this Ziyad set off for Basra along with his men\. There he came to know that the Kharijites had gone to Ahwaz\. Ziyad did not move onwards for paucity of force and informed Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) of it\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) called back Ziyad and sent Ma\`qil ibn

Qays ar\-Riyahi with two thousand experienced combatants towards Ahwaz and wrote to the governor of Basra \`Abdullah ibn Abbas to send two thousand swordsmen of Basra for the help of Ma\`qil\. Consequently, the contingent from Basra also joined them at Ahwaz and after proper organization, they got ready to attack the enemy\. But al\-Khirrit marched

<a id="page425"></a>on along with his men to the hills of Ramhurmuz\. These people also followed him and overtook him near these hills\. Both arrayed their forces and started attacking each other\. The result of this encounter was that three hundred and seventy Kharijites were killed in the battlefield while the rest ran away\. Ma\`qil informed Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) of his

performance and of the enemy’s defeat when Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)

directed him to chase them and to disintegrate their power so that they should not be able to raise heads again\. On receipt of this order, Ma\`qil moved on and overtook him on the coast of the Persian Gulf, where al\-Khirrit had by persuasion secured the cooperation of the people and enlisting men from here and the re, had collected a considerable force\. When Ma\`qil reached the re, he raised the flag of peace and announced that those who had collected from here and there should flee\. They would not be assaulted\. The effect of this announcement was that save for al\-Khirrit’s own community all others deserted him\. He organized those very men and commenced the battle but valorous combatants of Basra and Kufa displayed such excellent use of swords that in a short time one hundred and seventy men of the insurgents were killed while an\-Nu’man ibn Suhban ar\-Rasibi encountered al\-Khirrit \(ibn Rashid an\-Naji\) and eventually attacked and killed him\. Soon after his fall the enemy lost ground an d they fled from the battlefield\. Thereafter, Ma\`qil collected all themen, women and children from their camps at one place\. From among them those who were Muslims were released after swearing allegiance\. Those who had turned heretics were called upon to re \-embrace their Submission to the Will of Allah \(Islam\)\. Consequently all except one old Christian secured their release by accepting Islam but the old man was killed\. Then, Ma\`qil took with him those Christians of Banu Najiyah who had taken part in this rebellion together with their families\. When Ma\`qil reached Ardashir Khurrah \(a city of Iran\) these prisoners wailed and cried before its governor Masqalah ibn Hubayrah ash\-Shaybani and beseeched in all humility to do something for their release\. Masqalah sent word to Ma\`qil through Dhuhl ibn al\-Harith to sell these prisoners to him\. Ma\`qil agreed and sold those prisoners to him for five hundred thousand Dirhams and told him to dispatch the price immediately to Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)\.

He said that he was sending the first installment at once and the remaining installments would also be sent soon\. When Ma\`qil met Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) he related the whole event before him\. Amir al\-Mu’minin

\(x\) ratified this action and waited for the price for some time, but Masqalah observed such deep silence as if nothing was due from him\. At last Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) sent a messenger to him with word to either send the price or to come himself\. On Amir al\-Mu’minin’s order he came

<a id="page426"></a>to Kufa and on demand of the price paid two hundred thousand Dirhams\. But, to evade the balance he went to Mu\`awiyah, who made him the governor of Tabaristan\. When Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) came to know all

this he spoke these words \(as in this sermon\) \. Its sum total is that: Had he stayed, we would have been considerate to him in demanding the price and would have waited for an improvement of his financial condition\. But he fled like slaves after displaying a showy act\. Talk about his high perseverance had just started when people began to discuss his baseless and lowliness\.

**Sermon 45**

**About Allah’s Greatness and the Lowliness of this World**

Praise is due to Allah from Whose mercy no one loses hope, from Whose bounty no one is deprived, from Whose forgiveness no one is disappointed and for Whose worship no one is too high\. His mercy never ceases and His bounty is never missed\.

This world is a place for which destruction is ordained and departure, for its inhabitants, is destined\. It is sweet and green\. It hastens towards its seeker and attaches to the heart of the viewer\. So depart from here with the best of provision available with you and do not ask herein more than what is enough and do not demand from it more than subsistence\.

**Sermon 46**

**When Amir Al\-Mu’minin \(x\) Decided to March Towards Syria, He Made These Statements:**

Lord\! I seek Your protection from the hardships of the journey, from the grief of returning and from the scene of devastation of property and men\. O Allah, You are the companion in journey and You are one who is left behind for \(protection of the \) family\. None except You can join these two because one who is left behind cannot be a companion on a journey nor one who is in company on a journey at the same time can be left behind\.

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: The earlier part of his sermon is related from the Prophet \(h\) but Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) has completed

<a id="page427"></a>it very aptly by adding most eloquent sentences at the end\. This addition is from ANone except You can join up to the end\.

**Sermon 47**

**About Calamities Befalling Kufa:**

O Kufa\! It is as though I see you being drawn like the tanned leather of \`Ukazi 135 in the market\. You are being scraped by calamities and being ridden by severe troubles\. I certainly136 know that if any tyrant intends evil for you Allah will afflict him with worry and fling him with a killer \(set someone on him to kill him\)\.

**Sermon 48**

**Delivered at the Time of Marching Towards Syria\.**

Praise is due to Allah when night spreads and darkens and praise be to Allah whenever the star shines and sets\. And praise be to Allah Whose bounty never misses and whose favors cannot be repaid\.

135During pre\-Islamic days, a market used to be organized every year near Mecca\. Its name was \`Ukaz where mostly hides were traded and as a result, leather was attributed to it\. Besides the sales and purchases, literary meetings were also arranged and Arabs used to attract admiration by reciting their works\. After Islam because of the better congregation in the form of Hajj, this market diminished\.

136This prediction of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) was fulfilled word for word

and the world saw how the people who had committed tyranny and oppression on the strength of their masterly power had to face the tragic end\. The ways of their own destruction were engendered by their blood \-shedding and homicidal activities\. Consequently, the end of Ziyad ibn Abih \(son of an unknown father\) was that when he intended to deliver a speech for vilification of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) suddenly

paralysis overtook him and he could not get out of his bed\. The end of the bloodshed perpetrated by Ubaydullah ibn Ziyad was when he fell prey to leprosy and eventually blood thirsty swords put him to death\. The ferocity of al\-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf ath\-Thaqafi drove him to the fate that snakes cropped up in his stomach as a result of which he died after severe pain\. \`Umar ibn Hubayrah al\-Fizari died of leucoderma\. Khalid ibn Abdillah al\-Qasri suffered the hardships of prison and was killed in a very bad way\. Mis’ab ibn az\-Zubayr and Yazid ibn al\-Muhallab ibn Abu Sufrah were also killed by swords\.

<a id="page428"></a>Well, I have sent forward my vanguard137 and have ordered them to remain in the camp on this bank of the river till my order reaches them\. My intention is that I should cross this water over to the small habitation of people residing on the sides of the Tigris and rouse them to march with you towards the enemy and keep them as an auxiliary force for you\.

**Sermon 49**

**About Allah’s Greatness and Sublimity**

Praise be to Allah Who lies inside all hidden things and towards Whom all open things are guided\. He cannot be seen by the eye of an onlooker, but the eye which does not see Him cannot deny Him while the mind that proves His existence cannot perceive Him\. He is so high in sublimity that nothing can be more sublime than He, while in nearness, He is so near that no one can be nearer than He\. But his sublimity does not put Him at a distance from anything of His creation, nor does His nearness bring them on equal level to Him\. He has not informed \(human\) wit about the limits of His qualities\. Nevertheless, He has not prevented it from securing any essential knowledge of Him\. He is such that all signs of existence testify for Him till the denying mind also believes in Him\. Allah is sublime beyond what is described by those who liken Him to things or those who deny Him\.

**Sermon 50**

**About Mixing Right With Wrong**

The basis of the occurrence of evils are those desires which are acted upon and the orders that are innovated\. They are against the Book of Allah\. People cooperate with each other about them even though it is against the religion of Allah\. If wrong had been pure and unmixed it would not be hidden from those who are in search of it\. And if right had been pure without admixture of wrong those who bear hatred towards it would have been silenced\. However, what is done is that something is

137Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: Here by _mitat_ Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)

has meant the direction wherein he had ordered the men to camp and that was the bank of the Euphrates\. _Mitat_ is used for the bank of a river although its literal meaning is a level ground whereas by _nutfa_ he means the water of the Euphrates and these are amazing expressions\.

<a id="page429"></a>taken from here and something from there and the two are mixed\! At this stage Satan overpowers his friends and they alone escape for whom virtue has been apportioned by Allah from before\.

**Sermon 51**

**During the Battle of Siffin, the men who were fighting on the side of Mu\`awiyah overpowered the men of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\), occupying the bank of the River Euphrates and preventing them from having access to its water\. It is then that Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) said the following:**

They are asking you for morsels of battle\. So, either you remain in ignominy and the lowest status or drench your swords with blood and quench your thirst with water\. Real death is living in subjugation, while real life is in dying as subjugators\. Beware, Mu\`awiyah is leading a small group of insurgents and has kept them in the dark about the true facts with the result that they have made their bosoms the targets of death\.

Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) had not reached Siffin when Mu\`awiyah

posted forty thousand of his fighting men on the bank of the river to close the way to the watering place, so that none except the Syrians could take the water\. When Amir al\- Mu’minin’s force alighted the re, they found that there was no watering place except for one possibility\. If it existed, it was difficult to reach due to crossing high hillocks\. Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)

sent Sa\`sa\`ah ibn Suhan al\-Abdi to Mu\`awiyah with the request to release control over the water\. Mu\`awiyah refused\. On this side Amir al\-Mu’minin’s army was troubled by thirst\. When Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\)

noticed this status he said, “Get up and secure water by dint of the sword\.” Consequently, these thirsty persons drew their swords out of sheaths, put arrows in their bows and dispersing Mu\`awiyah’s men, went down toward the river, forcing his guards away\. They then took control of the watering place themselves\.

Now, Amir al\-Mu’minin’s men also desired that just as Mu\`awiyah had put restrictions on the water by occupation, the same treatment should be accorded to him and his men and no Syrian should be allowed water and everyone of them should be made to die of thirst\. But Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) said, “Do you want to take the same brutal step

which these Syrians had taken? Never prevent anyone from water\. Whoever wants to drink, may drink and whoever wants to take away may

<a id="page430"></a>take away\.” Consequently, despite occupation of the River by Amir al\-Mu’minin’s army, no one was prevented from the water and everyone was given full liberty to use it\.

**Sermon 52**

**This Sermon Has Already Been Cited But, Due to the Difference Between the Two Versions, We Have Quoted it Again Here\. Its Subject Is the Downfall of the World and Reward and Punishment in the Hereafter\.**

Beware\! The world is wrapping itself up and has announced its departure\. Its known things have become strangers and it is speedily moving backward\. It is advancing its inhabitants towards destruction and driving its neighbors towards death\. Its sweet things \(enjoyments\) have become sour and its clear things have become polluted\. Consequently, what has remained of it is just like the remaining water in a vessel or a mouthful of water in the measure\. If a thirsty person drinks it his thirst shall not be quenched\.

O servants of Allah\! get ready to go out of this world for whose inhabitants decay is ordained\. \(Beware\) heart’s wishes should overpower you, nor should you take your stay \(in life\) to be long\. By Allah, if you cry like the she\-camel that has lost its young one or call out like the cooing of pigeons or make noise like devoted recluses and turn to Allah, leaving your wealth and children as a means to secure His nearness and high status with Him or the forgiveness of sins which have been covered by His books and recorded by His angels, it would be less than His reward that I expect for you or His retribution that I fear about you\.

By Allah, if your hearts thoroughly melt and your eyes shed tears of blood either in hopes for Him or for fear of Him and, if you are also allowed to live in this world all the time that it lasts, even then, your actions cannot pay for His great bounties over you and His having guided you towards faith\.

**A portion of the same sermon describing the Feast of Sacrifice \(\`¦d al\-Adha\) and the qualities of the animal for sacrifice\.**

For an animal to be fully fit for sacrifice it is necessary that both its ears be raised upwards and its eyes should be healthy\. If the ears and

<a id="page431"></a>the eyes are sound the animal of sacrifice is sound and perfect, even though its horn be broken or it drags its feet to the place of sacrifice\.

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: Here place of sacrifice means place of slaughter\.

**Sermon 53**

**On the Oath of Allegiance**

They leaped upon me as the camels leap upon each other on their arrival for drinking water, having been let loose after unfastening of their four legs till I thought they would either kill me or kill one another in front of me\. I thought over this matter in and out to the extent that it prevented me from sleeping\. But I found no way except to fight them or else to reject whatever has been brought by Muhammad \(h\)\. I found that

to face war was easier for me than to face the retribution and the hardships of this world were easier than the hardships of the next world\.

**Sermon 54**

**When Amir Al\-Mu’minin’s Showed Impatience on His Delay in Giving Them Permission to Fight in Siffin, He Said:**

As for your idea whether this \(delay\) is due to my unwillingness for death, then by Allah I do not care whether I proceed towards death or death advances towards me\. As for your impression that it may be due to my misgivings about the people of Syria, by Allah, I did not put off war even for a day except in the hope that some group may join me, find guidance through me and see my light with their weak eyes\. This is dearer to me than to kill them in the state of this misguidance although they would be bearing their own sins\.

**Sermon 55**

**About Steadfastness on the Battlefield**

In the company of the Prophet of Allah \(h\), we used to fight our

parents, sons, brothers and uncles\. This continued us in our faith, in submission, in our following the right path, in endurance over the pangs of pain and in our fight against the enemy\. A man from our side and one

<a id="page432"></a>from the enemy would pounce upon each other like energetic men contesting as to who would kill the other; sometimes our man gets over his adversary and sometimes the enemy’s man gets over ours\.

When Allah had observed our truth He sent ignominy to our foe and sent His succor to us till Islam was established \(like the camel\) with its neck on the ground and resting in its place\. By my life, if we had also behaved like you, no pillar of \(our\) religion could have been raised, nor the tree of faith could have borne leaves\. By Allah, certainly you will now milk our blood \(instead of milk\) and eventually you will face shame\.138

**Sermon 56**

**Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) Said the Following to his Companions about Mu\`awiyah:**

138After Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr had been killed, Mu\`awiyah sent Abdullah ibn Amir al\-Hadrami to Basra to exhort the people of Basra to avenge Othman’s blood because the natural inclination of most of the inhabitants of Basra and particularly Banu Tamim was towards Othman\. Consequently, he stayed with Banu Tamim\. This was the time when Abdullah ibn Abbas, the governor of Basra had gone to Kufa for condolence about Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr, leaving Ziyad ibn Ubayd \(Abih\) as his substitute\. When the atmosphere in Basra began to deteriorate, Ziyad informed Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) of all the facts\. Amir al\-

Mu’minin \(x\) tried to get Banu Tamim of Kufa ready but they kept complete silence and gave no reply\. When Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) saw this weakness and shamelessness on their part he said, “During the days of the Prophet \(h\) we did not

see whether those killed at our hands were our kith and kin, but whoever collided with Right, we were prepared to collide with him\. If we too had acted carelessly or been guilty of inaction like you then neither religion could have taken root nor could Islam prosper\. The result of this shaking was that A’yan ibn Dabi’ah al\-Mujashi’i prepared himself but on reaching Basra he was killed by the swords of the enemy\. Thereafter, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) sent off Jariyah ibn Qudamah as\-

Sa\`di with fifty men of Banu Tamim\. First he tried his best to canvass his own tribe but instead of following the right path they stooped to abusing and fighting\. Then Jariyah called Ziyad and the tribe of Azd for his help\. Soon upon their arrival \(\`Abdullah\) ibn al\-Hadrami also came out with his men\. Swords were used from both sides for some time but eventually ibn al \-Hadrami fled with seventy persons and took refuge in the house of Sabil as\-Sa\`di\. When Jariyah saw no other way he set the house on fire\. When the flames arose, they came out in search of safety but could not succeed in running away\. Some of them were crushed to death under the wall while others were killed\.

<a id="page433"></a>Soon after me a man will be placed over you with a broad mouth and a big belly\. He will swallow whatever he gets and crave what he does not get\. You should kill him but \(I know\) you will not\. He will command you to abuse me and to renounce me\. As for abusing me, you will because that would mean purification for me and salvation for you\. As regarding renunciation, you should not renounce me because I have been born on the natural religion \(Islam\) and was foremost in \(accepting\) it as well as in Hijra \(migrating from Mecca to Medina\)\.

About the person to whom Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) has alluded in

this sermon some people hold that he is Ziyad ibn Abih; some hold that he is Mughirah ibn Shu\`bah\. But most of the commentators have held him to mean Mu\`awiyah and that is correct because the qualities that Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) has described prove true on him alone\. Thus, Ibn Abul\-Hadid has written about the gluttonous quality of Mu\`awiyah that once the Prophet \(h\) sent for him and he was informed that Mu\`awiyah was busy eating\. Then the second and the third time a man was sent to call him but he brought the same news\. Thereupon, the Prophet \(h\) said,

“May Allah never satisfy his belly\. The effect of this curse was that when he felt tired of eating he would say ATake the food away, for, by Allah I am not satiated but I am tired and disgusted\. Similarly, his abusing Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) and ordering his officers for it are accepted facts of history which cannot be denied\. In this connection such words were used on the pulpit that even Allah and the Prophet \(h\) were hit by them\. Thus, Umm al\-Mu’minin Umm Salamah wrote to Mu\`awiyah, “Certainly you people abuse Allah and the Prophet \(h\) as you hurl abuses on Ali and

those who love him, while I do testify that Allah and Prophet \(h\) did love him\.”139

Thanks to \`Umar ibn Abdul\-Aziz who put an end to it and introduced the following verse in place of the way abusive of Imam Ali \(x\) in the sermons:

Verily Allah enjoins justice and benevolence \(to others\) by giving to the kindred and forbids lewdness, evil and rebellion; He exhorts you that you may take heed \(Holy Quran, 16: 90\)\.

139*Al\-Iqd al\-Farid*, Vol\. 3, p\. 131\.

<a id="page434"></a>In this sermon, Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) has ordered his killing on

the basis of the Prophet’s order that “When you \(O Muslims\) see Mu\`awiyah on my pulpit, kill him\.”140

**Sermon 57**

**Addressing the Kharijites, Amir Al\-Mu’minin \(x\) Said the**

**Following:**

A storm may overtake you while there may be none to awaken you \(for reforms\)\. Shall I be a witness to my becoming heretic after the acceptance of faith and fighting in the company of the Prophet \(h\)?\! AIn

that case I shall be misguided and I shall not be on the right path\. \(Holy Quran, 6: 56\)\. So you should return to your evil places and get back on the traces of your heels\. Beware\! Certainly, after me, you will meet overwhelming disgrace, sharp swords and traditions that will be adopted by the oppressors as a norm towards you\.141

140*Siffin*, pp\.243, 248;* Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha *of Ibn Abul Hadid, Vol\. 1,\* *p\.348; *Tarkh Baghdad*, Vol\. 12, p\.181; *Mizan al\-I’tidal*, Vol\. 2, p\. 128; *Tahthib al\-Tahthib\*, Vol\. 2, p\. 428; Vol\. 5, p\. 110; Vol\. 7, p\.324\.

141History corroborates that after Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\), the Kharijites had

to face all kinds of ignominy and disgrace and wherever they raised their heads to create trouble they were met with swords and spears\. Thus Ziyad ibn Abih, Ubaydullah ibn Ziyad, al\-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, Mis’ab ibn az\-Zubayr and al\-Muhallab ibn Abu Sufrah left no stone unturned in annihilating them from the surface of the globe\. In particular, al\-Muhallab had chased them and routed them thoroughly for nineteen years, resting only after completing their destruction\.

Tabari writes that when ten thousand Kharijites collected in Silla wa sillibra \(the name of a mountain in Ahwaz\) then al\-Muhallab faced them so steadfastly that he killed seven thousand Kharijites, while the remaining three thousand fled for their lives towards Kirman\. But when the Governor of Iran noticed their rebellious activities he surrounded them in Sabur and killed a good number of them\. Those who remained fled to Isfahan and Kirman\. From there they again formed a contingent and advanced towards Kufa via Basra\. Al\-Harith ibn Abu Rabi\`ah al\-Makhzumi and Abd ar\-Rahman ibn Mikhnaf al\-Azdi stood up with six thousand combatants to stop their advance and turned them out of Iraq’s boundaries\. In this way successive encounters completely trampled their military power and turning them out of cities compelled them to roam about in the deserts\. Afterwards also, when they rose in the form of groups they were crushed\. \(_Tarikh_, Vol\. 2, pp\. 580\-591; Ibn al\-Athir, Vol\. 4, pp\. 196\-206\)\.

<a id="page435"></a>Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “In the words wala baqiyah minkum abirun used by Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\), the abir has been related

with ba and ra, and it has been taken from the Arab saying Rajulun abirun which means the man who prunes the date\-palm trees improves them\. In one version, the word is athir and its meaning is “relater of news\.’ In my view, this is more appropriate, as though Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) intends to say that there should remain none to carry news\.

In another version of the same sermon, the word appears as Abiz with Aza’ which means one who leaps\. One who dies is also called Abiz\.

**Sermon 58**

**When Amir Al\-Mu’minin \(x\) Announced His Intention to**

**Fight the Kharijites, He Was Told That They Had Crossed the Bridge of Nahrawan and Gone over to the Other Side\. It Was Then That Amir Al\-Mu’minin \(x\) Said the Following:**

Their falling place is on this side of the river\. By Allah, not even ten of them will survive while from your side not even ten will be killed\.142

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “In this sermon, nutfa implies the River Euphrates and for water this is thenicest expression even though water may be much\.”

**Sermon 59**

**When Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) Was Told That the Kharijites Had Been Totally Killed, He Said the Following:**

142This prediction cannot be attributed to wit and far\- sightedness\. Far\-sighted eyes may forecast victory or defeat and preconceive the outcome of war but to tell about the actual figures of the killed on either side is beyond their capacity\. This can be done only by one who can unveil the unknown future and see the coming scene with his eyes and who sees the sketches yet to appear on the, p\. of the future with the help of the light of knowledge possessed by him as Imam\. Consequently, events occurred according to what this inheritor of Prophet’s knowledge had said and from among the Kharijites all except nine persons were killed\. Two of them fled to Oman, two to Sajistan, two to Kirman and two to Jazira while one escaped to Tall Mawzan \(Mawzan Hill\)\. Of Amir al\-Mu’minin’s party only eight men fell as martyrs\.

<a id="page436"></a>By Allah\! No, not yet\! They still exist in the loins of men and wombs of women\. Whenever a chief would appear from among them he would be cut down till the last of them would turn thieves and robbers\.

This prediction of Amir al\-Mu’minin \(x\) also proved true word

for word\. Every chief of the Kharijites who rose was put to the sword\. A few of their chiefs who were put to death are mentioned here:

1. Nafi’ ibn Azraq al\-Hanafi: The largest group of the Kharijites namely al\-Azariqah is named after him\. He was killed by Salamah al\-Bahili during encounter with the army of Muslim ibn Ubays\.
2. Najdah ibn Amir: The an\-Najadat al\-\`Adhirriyyah sect of Kharijites is named after him\. Abu Fudayk, the Kharijite, killed him\.
3. Abdullah ibn Ibad at\-Tamimi: The sect Ibadite \(Ibadiyyah\) is named after him\. He was killed during an encounter with \`Abdullah ibn Muhammad ibn \`Atiyyah\.
4. Abu Bayhas Haysam ibn Jabir ad\-Duba’i: The sect of al\-Bayhasiyyah is named after him\. Othman ibn Hayyan al\-Murri, governor of Medina, severed his hands and feet then killed him\.
5. Urwah ibn Udayyah at\-Tamimi: Ziyad ibn Abih killed him during the reign of Mu\`awiyah\.
6. Qatari ibn al\-Fuja’h al\-Mazini at\-Tamimi: When he encountered the army of Sufyan ibn al\-Abrad al\-Kalbi in Tabarastan, then Sawrah, Ibn al\-Hurr ad\-Darimi killed him\.
7. Abu Milal Mirdas ibn Udayyah at\-Tamimi: He was killed in an encounter with Abbas ibn Akhdar al\-Mazini\.
8. Shawdhab al\-Khariji al\-Yashkuri: He was killed during an encounter with Sa’id ibn \`Amr al\-Harashi\.
9. Hawtharah ibn Wada’ al\-Asadi: He was killed at the hands of a man of Banu Tayy\.
10. Al\-Mustawrid ibn Ullafah at\-Taymi: He was killed by Ma\`qil ibn Qays ar\-Riyahi in the reign of Mu\`awiyah\.

<a id="page437"></a>1. Shabib ibn Yazid ash\-Shaybani: He died by being drowned in

the river\.

1. AImran ibn al\-Harith ar\-Rasibi: He was killed in the battle of

Dulab\.

13, 14\) Zahhaf at\-Ta’i and Qurayb ibn Murrah al\-Azdi: They were killed in an encounter with Banu Taliyah\.

1. az\-Zubayr ibn Ali as\-Saliti at\-Tamimi: He was killed in an encounter with Attab ibn Warqa’ ar\-Riyahi\.
2. Ali ibn Bashir ibn al\-Mahuz al\-Yarbu’i: “Al\-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf ath\-Thaqafi killed him\.
3. Ubaydullah ibn Bashir: He was killed in an encounter with al\-Muhallab ibn Abu Sufrah in the battle of Dulab\.
4. Abul\-Wazi’ ar\-Rasibi: “man in the graveyard of Banu Yashkur pushed a wall on him and killed him\.
5. Abd Rabbih as\-Saghir: He was killed in an encounter with al\-Muhallab ibn Abu Sufrah\.
6. al\-Walid ibn Tarif ash\-Shaybani: He was killed in an encounter with Yazid ibn Mazyad ash\-Shabani\.

\(21\-24\) Abdullah ibn Yahya al \-Kindi, al\-Mukhtar ibn Awf al\-Azdi \(Abu Hamzah ash\-Shari\), Abrahah ibn as\-Sabah and Balj ibn Uqbah al\-Asadi: They were killed by’Abdul \-Malik ibn \`Atiyyah as\-Sa\`di in the reign of Marwan ibn Muhammad \(the last of Umayyads caliph\)\.

**Sermon 60**

**Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Also Said the Following:**

Do not fight143 the Kharijites after me because one who seeks right but does not find it is not like one who seeks wrong and does find it\.

143The reason for stopping people from fighting the Kharijites was that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) was clearly perceiving that after him authority and

power would devolve on people who would be ignorant of the proper occasion of jihad, making use of the sword only to maintain their sway\. And there were those

<a id="page438"></a>Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) means Mu\`awiyah and his men\.”

**Sermon 61**

**Then Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Was Warned of Being Killed by Deceit, He Said the Following:**

Surely, there is a strong shield of Allah over me\. When my day would come it would get away from me and hand me to death\. At that time neither an arrow would go amiss nor a wound would heal\.

**Sermon 62**

**About the Transience of the World**

Beware\! Surely this world is a place from which protection cannot be sought except while one is in it\. The action which is performed only for this world cannot secure salvation\. People are tested in it through

who excelled, even the Kharijites, in holding and calling Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) wrong\. So those who are themselves in the wrong have no right to fight others

in the wrong\. Again, those who are willfully in the wrong can be allowed to fight those who are in the wrong by mistake\. Thus, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s words make this fact clear that the misguidance of Kharijites was not willful but under Satan’s influence\. They mistook wrong as right and stuck to it\. On the other hand, the status of misguidance of Mu\`awiyah and his party was that they rejected right realizing it as right and appropriated wrong as the code of their conduct knowing that it was wrong\. Their audacity in the matter of religion reached the stage that it can neither be regarded as a result of misunderstanding nor can it be covered under the garb of error of judgement\. They openly transgressed the limits of religion and paid no heed to the Prophet’s injunctions in comparison with their own view\. Thus, Ibn Abul\-Hadid has written \(Vol\. 5, p\.130\) that when the Prophet’s companion Abud\-Darda’ saw utensils of gold and silver being used by Mu\`awiyah he said he had heard the Prophet \(h\) saying, “One who drinks in vessels of gold and silver

will feel flames of the fire of Hell in his stomach, whereupon Mu\`awiyah said, As for me, I do not find any harm in it\. Similarly, creating Ziyad ibn Abih’s blood relationship with himself by his own opinion in total disregard of the Prophet’s injunction, abusing the descendants of the Prophet \(h\) over the pulpit,

transgressing the limits of shari’ah, shedding blood of innocent persons and placing over Muslims \(as so\-called caliph\) a vicious individual and thus opening the way to disbelief and atheism are events that to attribute them to any misunderstanding is like willfully closing one’s eyes to historic fact and common sense\.

<a id="page439"></a>calamities\. Those who have taken worldly pleasures here will be taken out from them \(by death\) and will be questioned about them\. And whatever \(good actions\) they have achieved for the other world, they will get them there and stay in them\. For the intelligent, this world is like the shade; one moment it is spread out and extended but soon it shrinks and contracts\.

**Sermon 63**

**About Decline and Destruction of the World**

O servants of Allah\! Fear Allah and anticipate your death by good actions\. Purchase everlasting joy by paying transitory things \- pleasures of this world\. Get ready for the journey, for you are being driven and prepare yourselves for death, since it is hovering over you\. Be a people who wake up when called and who know that this world is not their abode and so have changed it \(with the next\)\.

Certainly, Allah has not created you aimlessly nor left you useless\. There is nothing between anyone of you and Paradise or Hell except death that must befall him\. The life that is being shortened every moment and being dismantled every hour must be regarded very short\. The hidden thing, namely death, which is being driven \(to you\) by two phenomena which are day and night is certainly quick to approach\. The traveler which is approaching with success or failure \(namely death\) deserves the best of provision\. So acquire such provision from this world while you are here with which you may shield yourself tomorrow \(on the Day of Judgement\)\.

So everyone should fear Allah, admonish himself, send forward his repentance and overpower his desire because his death is hidden from him, his desires deceive him and Satan is posted on him\. He beautifies sin for him so that he may commit it and prompts him to delay repentance till his desires make him the most negligent\. Piety is for thenegligent person whose life itself would be a proof against him and his own days \(passed in sin\) would lead him to punishment\.

We ask Allah, the Glorified One, that He may make us and you like one whom bounty does not mislead, whom nothing can stop from obedience of Allah and whom shame and grief do not befall after death\.

<a id="page440"></a>

**Sermon 64**

**About Allah’s Attributes**

Praise be to Allah for Whom one condition does not proceed another so that He may be the First before being the Last or He may be Manifest before being Hidden\. Everyone called one \(alone\) save Him is by virtue of being small \(in number\), and everyone enjoying honor other than Him is humble\. Every powerful person other than Him is weak\. Every master \(owner\) other than Him is slave \(owned\)\.

Every knower other than Him is a seeker of knowledge\. Every controller other than Him is sometimes imbued with control and sometimes with disability\. Every listener other than Him is deaf to light voices while loud voices make him deaf and distant voices also leave him\. Every on\-looker other than Him is blind to hidden colors and delicate bodies\. Every manifest thing other than Him is hidden, but every hidden thing other than Him is incapable of becoming manifest\.

He did not create what He created to fortify His authority nor for fear of the consequences of time, nor to seek help against the attack of an equal or a boastful partner or a hateful opponent\. On the other hand all the creatures are reared by him and are His humbled slaves\. He is not conditioned in anything so that it be said that He exists the rein, nor is He separated from anything so as to be said that He is away from it\. The creation of what He initiated or the administration of what He controls did not fatigue Him\. No disability overtook Him against what He created\. No misgiving ever occurred to Him in what He ordained and resolved it\. But His verdict is certain, His knowledge is definite, His governance is overwhelming\. He is wished for at times of distress and He is feared even in bounty\.

**Sermon 65**

**In Some of the Fighting Days of the Battle of Siffin, Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Said the Following to His Followers about the Methods of Fighting:**

O crowd of Muslims\! Make fear of Allah the routine of your life\. Cover yourselves with peace of mind and clinch your teeth because this makes the sword slip off from the skull\. Complete your armor and shake your swords in their sheathe s before showing them out\. Have your eyes

<a id="page441"></a>on the enemy\. Use your spears on both sides and strike \(the enemy\) with swords\. Keep in mind that you are before Allah and in the company of the Prophet’s cousin\. Repeat your attacks and feel ashamed of running away because it is a shame for posterity and \(the cause of awarding you\) fire on the Day of Judgement\. Give your lives \(to Allah\) willingly and walk towards death with ease\. Beware of this great majority and the pitched tent and aim at its entirety as Satan is hiding in its corner\. He has extended his hand for assault and has kept back his foot for running away\. Keep on enduring till the light of Truth dawns upon you\.

While you have the upper hand and Allah is with you and never will He depreciate your deeds\. \(Holy Quran, 47: 35\)

**Sermon 66**

**When after the Death of the Prophet \(h\) News Reached Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) about the Happening in Saqifa of Banu**

**Sa’i\-dah, He Inquired What the Ansar Said\. People Said That They Were Asking for One Chief from among Them and One from the Others, Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Said the Following:**

Why did you not argue against them \(Ansar\) that the Prophet \(h\)

had left his will that whoever is good among the Ansar should be treated well and whoever is bad should be forgiven\.

People said the following: “What is there against them in it?”

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said, “If the Government was for them there should have been no will in their favor\.”

Then he said the following: “What did the tribesmen of Quraish plead?” People answered: “They argued that they belong to the lineal tree of the Prophet \(h\)\.”

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said, “They argued with the tree but spoiled the fruits\.”

From what happened at the saqifa of Banu Sa’idah, it appears that the greatest argument of the Muhajirun against the Ansar and the basis of the former’s success was this very point that since they were the kith and

<a id="page442"></a>kin of the Prophet \(h\) no one else could deserve the Caliphate\. On this

very ground the big crowd of Ansar became ready to lay down their weapons before three Muhajirun and the latter succeeded in winning the Caliphate by presenting their distinction of descent\. Thus in connection with the events of saqifa al\-Tabari writes that when the Ansar assembled in the saqifa \(shed\) of Banu Sa\`idah to swear allegiance on the hand of Sa\`d ibn Abadah, somehow Abu Bakr, Umar and Abu Ubaydah ibn al\-Jarrah also got the hint and reached the re\. Umar had thought out something for this occasion and he rose to speak but Abu Bakr stopped him and he himself stood up\. After praising Allah and the migration of the Muhajirun and their precedence in Islam, he said the following: “They are those who worshipped Allah first of all and accepted belief in Allah and his Prophet’s friends and his kith and kin\. Therefore, these alone deserve the Caliphate themost\. Whoever clashes with them commits excess\.”

When Abu Bakr finished his speech, al\-Hubab ibn Mundhir stood up and, turning to the Ansar said the following: “O group of Ansar\! Do not give your reins in the hand of others\. The populace is under your care\. You are men of honor, wealth, tribe and gathering\. If the Muhajirun have precedence over you in some matters, you too have precedence over them in other matters\. You gave them refuge in your houses\. You are the fighting arm of Islam\. With your help Islam stood on its own feet\. In your cities the prayer of Allah was established with freedom\. Save yourselves from division and dispersion and stick to your right unitedly\. If the Muhajirun do not concede to your right tell them there should be one chief from us and one from them\.

No sooner had al\-Hubab sat down after saying this then Umar rose and spoke thus: “This cannot be\! There can be no two rulers at one and the same time\. By Allah\! The Arabs will never agree to have you as the head of the state since the Prophet \(h\) was not from among you\.

Certainly, the Arabs will not have the least objection in that the caliphate is allowed to one in whose house the Prophethood rests so that the ruler should also be from the same house\. For those who dissent, clear arguments can be put forth\. Whoever comes in conflict with us in the matter of the authority and rulership of Muhammad \(h\) he is leaning

towards wrong, is a sinner and is falling into destruction\.

After \`Umar, al\-Hubab again stood up and said to the Ansar, ALook, stick to your point and do not pay heed to the views of this man or his supporters\. They want to trample your rights\. If they do not consent

<a id="page443"></a>turn him and them out of your cities and appropriate the Caliphate\. Who other than you can deserve it more?

When al \-Hubab finished \`Umar scolded him\. There was a use of bad words from that side also and the status began to worsen\. On seeing this Abu Ubaydah ibn al\-Jarrah spoke with the intention of cooling down the Ansar and to win them over to his side and said the following:

“O Ansar\! You are the people who supported us and helped us in every manner\. Do not now change your ways and do not give up your behavior\.” But the Ansar refused to change their mind\. They were prepared to swear allegiance to Sa\`d and people just wanted to approach him when a man of Sa\`d’s tribe Bashr ibn \`Amr al\-Khazraji stood up and said the following: “No doubt we came forward for jihad and gave support to the religion, but our aim in doing thus was to please Allah and to obey His Prophet \(h\)\. It does not behoove us to claim superiority and

create trouble in the matter of the caliphate\. Muhammad \(h\) was from

Quraish and they have a greater right for it and are more appropriate for it\.”

As soon as Bashir uttered these words, dissension occurred among the Ansar, and this exactly was his aim because he could not see a man of his own tribe rising so high\. The Muhajirun took advantage of this division among the Ansar and Umar and Aba \`Ubaydah decided to swear allegiance to Abu Bakr\. They had just come forward when Bashir first of all put his hand on that of Abu Bakr and after that \`Umar and Abu Ubaydah swore the allegiance\. Then the people of Bashr’s tribe came and swore allegiance and trampled Sa\`d ibn Abadah under their feet\.

During this time Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) was occupied in the funeral bath and burial of the Prophet \(h\)\. When afterwards he heard

about the assembly at the saqifa and came to know that the Muhajirun had won the score over the Ansar by pleading themselves to be from the tribe of the Prophet \(h\), he uttered the fine sentence that those who argued on the lineal tree spoiled its fruits\. That is, if the Muhajirun’s claim was acceded for being from the lineal tree of the Prophet \(h\), how can those who are the fruits of this tree be ignored? It is strange that Abu Bakr who connects with the Prophet \(h\) in the seventh generation above and \`Umar who connects with him in theninth generation above may be held of the tribe and family of the Prophet \(h\) and he who was his first cousin is refused the status of a brother\.

**Sermon 67**

**When Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Appointed Muhammad Ibn Abu Bakr as the Ruler of Egypt, and the Latter Was Overpowered and Killed, Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Said the Following:**

He had intended to send Hashim ibn Utbah to Egypt and had I done so he would have neither made a way for the opponents nor given them time \(to get hold of him\)\. This is without reproach to Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr as I loved him and had raised him\.

Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr’s mother was Asma’ daughter of Umays whom Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) married after Abu Bakr’s death\. Consequently, Muhammad \(h\) lived and was brought up under the care of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and he imbibed his ways and manners\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) loved him and regarded him as his son, saying, “Muhammad \(h\) is my son from Abu Bakr\. He was born in the journey during the last Hajj \(of the Prophet \(h\)\) and died as a martyr in 38 A\.H\. at the age of twenty eight years\.

On accession to the Caliphate, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had

selected Qays ibn Sa\`d ibn Abadah as the Governor of Egypt but circumstances developed so that he had to be removed\. Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr was then sent there as Governor\. The policy of Qays there was that he did not want to take any serious step against the Othman group but Muhammad’s view was different\. After the lapse of a month he sent them word that in case they did not obey him their existence there would be impossible\. Upon this these people organized a front against him and engaged themselves in secret wire pulling, but became conspicuous soon\. After arbitration they started creating trouble with the slogan of vengeance\. This polluted the atmosphere of Egypt\. When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) came to know these deteriorated conditions he gave the

governorship of Egypt to Malik ibn al\- Harith al\- Ashtar and sent him off there in order that he might suppress insurgent elements and save the administration from getting worse\. Yet, he could not escape the evil designs of the Umayyads and was killed by poison while on his way\. Thus, the governorship of Egypt remained with Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr\.

<a id="page445"></a>On this side, the performance of Amr ibn al\-As in connection with the arbitration made Mu\`awiyah recall his own promise\. Consequently, he gave him six thousand combatants and set him off to attack Egypt\. When Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr knew of the advancing force of the enemy he wrote to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) for help\.

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) replied that he would be soon collecting help

for him but in the meantime he should mobilize his own forces\. Muhammad mobilized four thousand men under his banner and divided them into two formations\. He kept one part with himself and on the other he placed Kinanah ibn Bishr at\-Tujibi in command and ordered him to go forward to check the enemy’s advance\. When they settled down to camp before the enemy, various parties of the enemy began attacking them\. Yet, they faced them with courage and valour\. At last, Mu\`awiyah ibn Hudayj as\-Sikuni al\-Kindi made an assault with full force\. These people did not turn away from the enemy’s swords but faced them steadfastly and fell as martyrs in action\. The effect of this defeat was that Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr’s men got frightened and deserted him\. Finding himself alone, Muhammad fled and sought refuge in a deserted place\. The enemy however got news about him through someone and traced him out when he was dying with thirst\. Muhammad asked for water but these cruel men refused and butchered him thirsty\. Then they put his body in the belly of a dead ass and burnt it\.

Malik ibn Ka\`b al\-Arhabi had already left Kufa with two thousand men, but before he could reach Egypt it had been occupied by the enemy\.

**Admonishing His Companions Not to Be Careless in Their Behavior, Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Said the Following:**

How long shall I accord you consideration that is accorded to camels with hollow humps, or to worn clothe s which when stitched on one side give way on the other\. Whenever a vanguard force of Syria hovers over you, everyone of you shuts his door and hides himself like the lizard in its hole or a badger in its den\. By Allah, he whom people like you support must suffer disgrace and he who throws arrows with your support is as if he throws arrows that are broken both at head and tail\. By Allah, within the courtyard you are quite numerous but under the banner you are only a few\. Certainly, I know what can improve you and how your crookedness can be straightened\. But I shall not improve your

<a id="page446"></a>condition by marring myself\. Allah may disgrace your faces and destroy you\. You do not understand the right as you understand the wrong and do not crush the wrong as you crush the right\.

**Sermon 69**

**Delivered in the Morning of the Day When Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Was Fatally Struck with a Sword’s Blow:**

I was sitting when sleep overtook me\. I saw the Prophet of Allah \(k\) appear before me and I said, “O Prophet of Allah \(k\)\! what crookedness and animosity I had to face from the people\.” The Prophet of Allah \(k\) said the following: “Invoke \(Allah\) evil upon them, but I said,

“Allah may change them for me with better ones and change me for them with a worse one\.”

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “Al\-awad means crookedness and al\-ladad means animosity; this is a most eloquent expression\.”

**Condemning the Then People of Iraq:**

Ow, then, O folks\!144

144When after arbitration the Iraqis displayed lethargy and heartlessness in retaliating against the continuous attacks of Mu\`awiyah, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) delivered this sermon scorning and admonishing them\. Herein he has referred to

their being deceived at Siffn and has likened them to a woman who has five qualities:

1. Firstly, she is pregnant\. This implies that these people had full capability to fight and were not like a barren woman from whom nothing is expected\.
2. Secondly, she has completed the period of pregnancy\. That is they had passed over all difficult stages and has approached near the final goal of Victory\.
3. Thirdly, she willfully miscarries her child\. That is after coming close to victory they came down to settlement and instead of achieving the coveted goal faced disappointment\.

Iv \) Fourthly, her period of widowhood is long\. That is they fell in such a state as though they had no protector or patron and they were roaming about without any ruler\.

1. Fifthly, her successors would be distant persons\. That is the people of Syria who had no relationship with them would occupy their properties\.

<a id="page447"></a>You are like the pregnant woman who, on completion of the period of pregnancy delivers a dead child and her husband is also dead and her period of widowhood is long while only remote relationship inherits her\. By Allah, I did not come to you of my own accord\. I came to you by force of circumstances\. I have come to know that you say Ali speaks lies\. May Allah fight you\! Against whom do I speak lies? Against Allah? But I am the first to have believed in Him\. Against His Prophet \(h\) ? But I am the first who testified to him\. Certainly not\. By Allah it

was a way of expression which failed to appreciate and you were not capable of it\. Woe unto you\. I am giving out these measures of nice expression free of any cost\. I wish there were vessels good enough to hold them\.

Certainly, you will understand it after some time\. \(Holy Quran,

38: 88\)

**Here, Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Tells People How to Pronounce the Asalawat \(To Invoke Divine Blessings on the Prophet \[h\]\):**

O Lord\! Spreader of the surfaces \(of earth\) and Keeper \(intact\) of all skies, Creator of hearts on good and evil nature, \(I invoke You to\) send Your choicest blessings and growing favors on Muhammad \(h\), Your

servant and last Prophet \(h\), opener for what is closed, proclaimer of

truth with truth, repulser of the forces of wrong and crusher of the onslaughts of misguidance\. As he was burdened \(with responsibility of Prophethood\) so he bore it standing by Your commands, advancing towards Your will, without shrinking of steps of weakness of determination, listening to Your revelation, preserving Your testament, proceeding forward in the spreading of Your commands till he lit fire for its seeker and lit the path for the groper in the dark\.

Hearts achieved guidance through him after being ridden with troubles\. He introduced clear guiding signs and shining injunctions\. He is Your trusted trustee, the treasurer of Your treasured knowledge, Your witness on the Day of Judgement, Your envoy of truth and Your Messenger towards the people\. My Allah prepare a large place for him under Your shade and award him multiplying good by Your bounty\.

<a id="page448"></a>My God, give height to his construction above all other constructions, heighten his status with You, grant perfection to his glory and perfect for him his light\. In reward for his discharging Your Prophethood, grant him that his testimony be admitted and his speech be loved for his speech is just and his judgements are clear\-cut\. My Allah put us and him together in the pleasure of life, continuance of bounty, satisfaction of desires, enjoyment of pleasures, ease of living, peace of mind and gifts of honor\.

**Sermon 72**

**When Marwan ibn al\-Hakam was taken captive during the Battle of the Camel \(Jamal\) in Basra, he asked Hassan and Hussain \(peace be upon them\) to intercede on his behalf before Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\. So they spoke to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) about**

**him and he released him\. Then they said, “O Imam Ali\! Marwan desires to swear his allegiance to you, whereupon Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said the following:**

Did he not swear me allegiance after the killing of Othman? Now I do not need his allegiance because his is the hand of a Jew\. If he swears me allegiance with his hand he would violate it after a short while\. Well, he is to get power for so long as a dog licks his nose\. He is the father of four rams \(who will also rule\)\. The people will face hard days through him and his sons\.

Marwan ibn al \-Hakam was the nephew and son\-in\-law of Othman\. Due to a thin body and tall stature he was known with the nickname “Khayt Batil” \(thread of falsehood\)\. When \`Abdul\-Malik ibn Marwan killed \`Amr ibn Sa’id al\-Ashdaq, his brother Yahya ibn Sa’id said the following: “O sons of Khayt al\-Batil \(the thread of wrongdoing\)\! You have played deceit on \`Amr and people like you build their houses \(of authority\) on deceit and treachery\.”

Although his father, al\- Hakam ibn Abul\-As, had accepted Islam at the time of the fall of Mecca, his behavior and activities caused a great deal of pain to the Prophet \(h\)\. Consequently, the Prophet \(h\) cursed

him and his descendants and said, “Woe will befall my people from the progeny of this man\.” At last in view of his increasing intrigues, the Prophet \(h\) exiled him from Medina towards the valley of Hajj \(in Ta’if\)

and Marwan also went with him\. Thereafter, the Prophet \(h\) did not

<a id="page449"></a>allow them to enter Medina as long as he was alive\. Abu Bakr and Umar did likewise, but Othman sent for both of them during his reign and raised Marwan to such a height as though the reins of caliphate rested in his hands\. Thereafter his circumstances became so favorable that on the death of Mu\`awiyah ibn Yazid he became the Caliph of the Muslims\. He had only ruled nine months and eighteen days before death overtook him in such a way that his wife sat with the pillow on his face and did not leave until he breathe d his last\.

The four sons to whom Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has referred

were the four sons of Abdul\-Malik ibn Marwan namely al\-Walid, Sulayman, Yazid and Hisham, who ascended the Caliphate one after the other and colored the, pp\. of history with their stories\. Some commentators have regarded this reference to Marwan’s own sons whose names are Abdul\-Malik, Abdul\-Aziz, Bishr and Muhammad \(h\)\. Out of

these Abdul \-Malik did become Caliph of Islam but Abdul\-Azaz became governor of Egypt, Bishr of Iraq and Muhammad of Jazira\.

**Sermon 73**

**When the Consultative Committee \(Or Shura\) Decided to Swear the Oath of Allegiance to \`Othman, Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Said the Following:**

You have certainly known that I am the most rightful of all others for the Caliphate\. By Allah\! So long as the affairs of the Muslims remain intact and there is no oppression in it save on myself I shall be keeping aloof from its attractions and allurements for which you aspire\.

**Sermon 74**

**When Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Learned That the**

**Umayyads Blamed Him for Killing Othman, He Said the Following:**

The Umayyads’ knowledge of my personality did not desist them for accusing me, nor did my precedence \(in accepting Islam\) keep these ignorant people from blaming me\. Allah’s admonitions are more eloquent than my tongue\. I contest against those who break away from Faith and oppose those who entertain doubts\. Uncertainties should be placed before Holy Quran, the Book of Allah \(for clarification\)\. Certainly, people will be recompensed according to what they have in their hearts\.

**About Preaching and Counseling**

May Allah bless one who listens to a point of wisdom and retains it\. When he is invited to the right path he approaches it\. He follows a leader \(by catching his waistband\) and finds salvation, keeps Allah before his eyes and fears his sins\. He performs actions sincerely and acts virtuously, earns treasure of heavenly rewards, avoids vice, aims at \(good\) objective and reaps recompense\. He faces his desires and rejects \(fake\) hopes, makes endurance the means to his salvation and piety the provision for his death\. He rides on the path of honor and sticks to the highway of truth\. He makes good use of his time and hastens towards the end and takes with him the provision of \(good\) actions\.

**Sermon 76**

**About the Umayyads**

Banu Umayyah \(the Umayyads\) are allowing me the inheritance of Muhammad \(h\) bit by bit\. By Allah, if I live I would throw them

away as the butcher removes the dust from the dust\-covered piece of flesh\.

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: In one version for “al\-widhamu’ taribah” \(dust covered piece of flesh\) the words Aat\-turabulwadhimah \(the soil sticking on a piece of flesh\) have been shown\. That is, for the adjective the qualified noun and for the qualified noun the adjective has been placed\. As for the word “layufawwiqunani”, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) implies that they allow him bit by bit just as a she\-

camel may be milked a little then its young one may be made to suck milk so that it may be ready to be milked\. And “al\- widham” is the plural of “wadhamah” which means the piece of stomach or of liver which falls on the ground then the dust is removed from it\.

**Sermon 77**

**Supplications by Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\):**

O Lord\! Forgive what You know about me more than I do\. If I return \(to the sins\) You return to forgiveness\. My Allah forgive me for

<a id="page451"></a>what I had promised to myself but You did not find its fulfillment with me\. My Allah forgive me with what I sought nearness to You with my tongue but my heart opposed and did not perform it\. My Allah forgive my winking of the eye, vile utterances, desires of the heart and errors of speech\.

**Sermon 78**

**When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) decided to set out for the**

**battle with the Kharijites 1 someone said, “If you set out at this moment then according to astrology I fear you will not be successful in your aim,” whereupon Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said the following:**

145When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) decided to march towards Nahrawan

to suppress the risings of the Kharijites, Aff ibn Qays al\-Kindi said to him, “This hour is not good\. If you set out at this time, then instead of victory and success you will face defeat and be vanquished\.” But Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) paid no heed

to his view and ordered the army to march that very moment\. As a result, the Kharijites suffered such a clear defeat that out of their nine thousand combatants only nine individuals saved their lives by running away while the rest were killed\.

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has argued about astrology being wrong or

incorrect in three ways\. Firstly, if the view of an astrologer is accepted as correct it would mean falsification of the Holy Quran\. An astrologer claims to ascertain hidden things of failure by seeing the stars while the Holy Quran says the following:

Say: “None \(either\) in the heavens or in the earth knows the unseen save

Allah” \(27: 65\)\.

Secondly, under his misconception, the astrologer believes that he can know his benefit or harm through knowing the future\. In that case it would be useless to turn to Allah and seek His help; while this indifference towards Allah and self\-reliance is a sort of heresy and atheism, which puts an end to his hope in Allah\. Thirdly, if he succeeds in any objective, he would regard this success to be the result of his knowledge of astrology, the results from which he would praise himself rather than Allah and will expect that whomever he guides \(in this manner\) would necessarily be grateful to him rather than to Allah\. These points do not apply to astrology to the extent it may be believed that the astrological findings are in the nature of effect of medicines which are subject to alteration at will of Allah\. The competence achieved by most of our religious scholars in astrology is correct in this very ground that they did not regard its findings as final\.

<a id="page452"></a>Do you think you can tell the hour when a man goes out and no evil will befall him or can warn of the time at which if one goes out harm will accrue? Whoever testifies to this, falsifies the Holy Quran and becomes unmindful of Allah in achieving his desired objective and in warding off the undesirable\. You cherish saying this so that he who acts on what you say should praise you rather than Allah because according to your misconception you have guided him about the hour in which he would secure benefit and avoid harm\.

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) then advanced towards the people and said the following:

O People\! Beware of learning the science of stars except that with which guidance is sought on land or sea because it leads to divining and an astrologer is a the Diviner, while the Diviner is like the sorcerer, the sorcerer is like the unbeliever and the unbeliever would be in Hell\. Proceed forward in the Name of Allah\.

**Sermon 79**

**After the Battle of Jamal, Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Said the Following about Physical Defects of Women:**

O people\! Women are deficient in faith, deficient in shares and deficient in intelligence\. As regarding the deficiency in their faith, it is their abstention from prayers and fasting during their menstrual period\. As regarding deficiency in their intelligence it is because the testimony of two women is equal to that of one man\. As for the deficiency of their shares that is because of their share in inheritance being half of men\. So beware of the evils of women\. Be on your guard even from those of them who are \(reportedly\) good\. Do not obey them even in good things so that they may not attract you to evils\.

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) delivered this sermon after the

devastation caused by the Battle of Jamal\. Since the devastation resulting from this battle was the outcome of blindly following a woman’s command, in this sermon, he has described women’s physical defects and their causes and effects\. Thus their first weakness is that for a few days in every month they have to abstain from prayer and fasting and this abstention from worship is a proof of their deficiency in faith\. Although the real meaning of Iman \(belief\) is heart\-felt testimony and an inner conviction, yet metaphorically, it also applies to action and character\.

<a id="page453"></a>Since actions are the reflection of belief, they are also regarded as part of belief\. Thus, it is related from Imam Ali ibn Musa ar Rida \(x\) that: “Iman

\(belief\) is a testimony at heart, an admission by the tongue and action by the limbs\.

The second weakness is that their natural propensities do not admit the full performance of their intelligence\. Therefore, nature has given them the power of intelligence only in accordance with the scope of their activities which can guide them in pregnancy, delivery, child nursing, child care and household affairs\. On the basis of this weakness of mind and intelligence their testimony has not been accorded the status of man’s testimony, as Allah says the following:

\.\.\. Then call to witnesses two witness from among your men and if there not be two men then \(take\) a man for two women, of those you approve of the witnesses, so that should one of the two \(women\) forget the \(second\) one of the two may remind the other\. \(Holy Quran, 2: 282\)

The third weakness is that their share in inheritance is half of man’s share in inheritance as the Holy Quran says the following:

Allah enjoins you regarding your children\. The male shall have equal to the shares of two females\. \(Holy Quran, 4: 11\)

This shows woman’s weakness because the reason for her share in inheritance being half is that the liability of her maintenance rests on man\. When man’s status is that of a maintainer and caretaker the status of the weaker gender who is in need of maintenance and care\-taking is evident\.

After describing their natural weakness as Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) points out the mischief of blindly following them and wrongly

obeying them\. He says that not to say of bad things but even if they say with regard to some good things it should not be done in a way that these should feel as if it is being done in pursuance of their wish\. Rather it should be done in a way that they should realize that the good act has been performed because of its being good and that their pleasure or wish has nothing to do with it\. If they have even the doubt that their pleasures has been kept in view in it they would slowly increase in their demands and would wish that they should be obeyed in all matters however evil, the inevitable consequence whereof will be destruction and ruin\. Shaikh

<a id="page454"></a>Muhammad Abdo writes about this view of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

as under:

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has said what is corroborated by the experiences of centuries\.

**Sermon 80**

**About the Methods of Preaching and Counseling**

O people\! Abstinence is to shorten desires, to be thankful for bounties and to keep from prohibitions\. If this is possible then \(at least\) the prohibitions should not overpower your patience\. Allah has exhausted the excuse before you through clear, shining arguments and open, bright books\.

**Sermon 81**

**About the World and its People**

How shall I describe this world whose beginning is grief and whose end is destruction?146

146The beginning of the world is grief and its end is destruction\. This sentence contains the same truth which the Holy Quran has presented in the verse saying, “_Indeed We have created man \(to dwell\) amid hardship_” \(90: 4\)\.

It is true that right from the narrow womb of the mother and unto the vastness of the firmament the changes of human life do not come to an end\. When man first tastes life he finds himself closed in such a dark prison where he can neither move the limbs nor change the sides\. When he gets rid of this confinement and steps in this world he has to pass through innumerable troubles\. In the beginning he can neither speak with the tongue so as to describe his difficulty or pain nor does he possess energy in the limbs so as to accomplish his needs himself\. Only his suppressed sobs and flowing tears express his needs and translate his grief and sorrow\. When after the laps of this period he enters the stage of learning and instruction, then on every step voices of admonition and abuse welcome him\. All the time he seems frightened and terrified\. When he is relieved of this period of subjugation he finds himself surrounded by the worries of family life and livelihood, where sometime, there is clash with comrades in profession, sometimes collision with enemies, sometimes confrontation with vicissitudes of time, sometimes attack of ailments and sometimes the shock of children\. Then old age approaches him with the tidings of helplessness and

<a id="page455"></a>The lawful actions performed here have to be accounted for, while for the forbidden one there is punishment\. Whoever is rich here faces mischief and whoever is poor gets grief\. One who hankers after it does not get it\. If one keeps away from it then it advances towards him\. If one sees through it, it would bestow him sight, but if one has his eye on it then it would blind him\.

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “If a thinker thinks over this phrase of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) waman absara biha bassarat’hu \(If

one sees through it, it would bestow him sight\), he would find the rein a very amazing meaning and far\-reaching sense the purpose of which cannot be appreciated and whose aim cannot be understood particularly when he joins it with Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s phrase waman absara ilayha a a\`matahu \(If one has his eye on it, then it would blind him\), he

weakness and eventually he bids farewell to this world with mortification and grief in the heart\.

Thereafter Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) says about this world, that within

its lawful actions there is the question of reckoning and in its forbidden acts there are hardships of punishment, as a result of which even pleasant joys also produce bitterness in his palate\. If there is plenty of wealth and money in this world then man finds himself in such a whirlpool \(of worries\) that he loses his joy and peace of mind\. But if there is want and poverty, he is ever crying for wealth\. For he who hankers after this world there is no limit to his desires\. If one wish is fulfilled the desire for fulfillment of another wish crops up\. This world is like the reflection\. If you run after it then it will itself run forward but if you leave it and run away from it then it follows you\. In the same way, if a person does not run after the world, the world runs after him\. The implication is that if a person breaks the clutches of greed and avarice and keeps aloof from undesirable hankering after the world, he too gets \(pleasure of\) the world and he does not remain deprived of it\. Therefore, he who surveys this world from above its surface and takes lesson from its changes and happenings and through its variation and alterations gains knowledge about Allah’s Might, Wisdom and Sagacity, Mercy, Clemency and Sustaining power, his eyes will gain real brightness and sight\. On the other hand the person who is lost only in the colorfulness of the world and its decorations, loses himself in the darkness of the world\. This is why Allah has forbidden to view the world thus:

And strain not thine eyes unto that which We have provided \(different\) parties of them, \(of\) the splendor of the life of this world, so that We may try them in it; for the provision of your Lord is better and more abiding \(Holy Quran, 20: 131\)\.

<a id="page456"></a>would find the difference between absara biha and absara laha, clear, bright, wonderful and shining\.”

**Sermon 82**

**This Sermon Is Called Al\-gharra’, and it Is One of the Most Wonderful Sermons of Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\):**

Praise be to Allah Who is High above all else and is Near \(the creation\) through His bounty\. He is the Giver of all rewards and distinction and Dispeller of all calamities and hardships\. I praise Him for His continuous mercy and His copious bounties\.

I believe in Him as He is the First of all and He is Manifest\. I seek guidance from Him as He is Near and is the Guide\. I seek His succor as He is Mighty and the Subduer\. I depend upon Him as He is the Sufficer and Supporter\. And I testify that Muhammad \(h\) \(blessing of Allah be

on him and his progeny\) is His slave and His Prophet \(h\)\. He sent him

for enforcement of His commands, for exhausting His pleas and for presenting warnings \(against eternal punishment\)\.

**Enjoining People to be Pious:**

O servants of Allah\! I admonish you to fear Allah Who has furnished illustrations and Who has timed for you your lives\. He has given you the covering of outfit147 and He has scattered for you livelihood\. He has surrounded you with His knowledge\. He has ordained rewards\. He has bestowed upon you vast bounties and extensive gifts\. He has warned you through far reaching arguments and He has counted you by numbers\. He has fixed for you ages \(to live\) in this place of test and house of instruction\.

147Allah has furnished every creature with a natural outfit: The means of protecting it from cold and heat\. Thus, some animals are covered in feathers while some carry apparels of wool on their bodies\. But the high degree of intelligence of man and the quality of being timid and modest demands his distinction from other creatures\. Consequently, to maintain this distinction, he has been taught the ways of covering his body\. It was this natural impulse when Adam was made to give up his outfit he began to cover his body with leaves\. The Holy Quran says the following:

<a id="page457"></a>**Cautioning Against this World:**

You are tested in this world and have to render an accounting\. Certainly this world is a dirty watering place and a muddy source of drinking\.

Its appearance is attractive and its inside is destructive\. It is a delible deception, a vanishing reflection and a bent pillar\. When its despiser begins to like it and he who is not acquainted with it feels satisfied with it, then it praises and puts down its feet \(in joy\)\. It entraps him in its trap, makes him the target of its arrows and puts round his neck the rope of death taking him to the narrow grave and fearful abode in order to show him his place of stay and the recompense of his acts\. This goes on from generation to generation\. Neither death stops from cutting them asunder nor do the survivors keep aloof from committing sins\.

**Death and Resurrection:**

They are emulating each other and proceeding in groups towards the final objective and the rendezvous of death, till when matters come to a close, the world dies and resurrection draws near\. Allah148 will take

*So when they tasted \(of\) the tree their shameful things got displayed unto them and they began covering themselves with leaves of the Garden\.\(*Holy\* \*Quran, 7: 22\)

This was the punishment awarded for his committing what was better for him to omit\. When removal of outfit is punishment its putting on would be a favor and since this is peculiar to man it has been particularly mentioned\.

148The intention is that Allah would resurrect all the dead, even though they had been eaten by beasts and been merged in their bodies\. Its aim is to refute the view of the philosophers who hold that the resurrection of the non\-existent is impossible and who do not believe in the physical resurrection\. Their argument briefly is that a thing which has lost existence by death cannot return to life\. Consequently, after the destruction of this world the return of any of its beings to life is out of question\. But the belief is not correct because dispersal of the parts does not mean its non\-existence, so as to say that putting these parts together again would involve resurrection of the non\-existent\. On the other hand separated and dispersed parts continue to exist in some form or the other\. Of course, in this connection this objection has some force that when every person is to be resurrected in his own form, then in case one person has eaten the other, it would be impossible to resurrect either of them with his own constituent parts\. This would involve creating a deficiency of parts in he who had eaten the other\.

<a id="page458"></a>them out from the corners of the graves, the birds’ nests, the beasts’ dens and the centers of death\. They will hasten towards His command and run towards the place fixed for their final return group by group, quiet, standing and arrayed in rows\. They will be within Allah’s sight and He will hear everyone whom He calls\.

They will be wearing the outfit of helplessness and the covering of submission and indignity\. \(At this time\) contrivances will disappear, desires will be cut, hearts will quietly sink, voices will be curbed, sweat will choke the throat, fear will increase and ears will resound with the thundering voice of the announcer calling them towards final judgement, awarding recompense, striking with punishment and paying rewards\.

**The Limitation of Life:**

People have been created as a proof of \(His\) power\. They have been brought up with authority, they are made to die through pangs and placed in graves where they turn into crumbs\. Then they will be resurrected one by one, awarded their recompense and will have to account for their actions, each one separately\. They had been allowed time to seek deliverance, had been shown the right path and had been allowed to live and seek favors\. The darkness of doubts had been removed\. They had been let free in this period of life as a training place in order to make preparation for the race on the Day of Judgement, to search for the objective with thoughtfulness, to get time necessary to secure benefits and provide for the next place of stay\.

**No Happiness without Piety:**

How appropriate are these illustrations and effective admonitions provided they are received by pure hearts, open ears, firm views and sharp wits\. Fear Allah like him who listened \(from good advice\) and bowed before it, when he committed sin he admitted it, when he felt fear he acted virtuously\. When he apprehended he hastened \(towards good deeds\), when he believed he performed virtuous acts, when he was asked to take lesson \(from the happenings of this world\) he learned\. When he was

Metaphysicians have replied that in everybody there are some constituents which are essential and others which are non\-essential\. The essential constituents remain constant from the beginning till end of life and suffer no change or alteration and resurrection with regard to such constituents would not create any deficiency in the man who ate the other\.

<a id="page459"></a>asked to desist he abstained \(from evil\), when he responded to the call \(of Allah\) he leaned \(towards him\), when he turned back \(to evil\) he repented, when he followed he almost imitated and when he was shown \(the right path\) he saw it\.

Such a man was busy in search of truth and got rid \(of the worldly evils\) by running away\. He collected provision \(of good deeds\) for himself, purified his inner self, built for the next world and took provision for the day of his departure, keeping in view his journey, his requirement and the status of his need\. He sent ahead for the abode of his stay \(in the next world\)\. O servants of Allah\!, fear Allah keeping in view the reason why He created you and be afraid of Him to the extent He has advised you to do\. Make yourself deserve what He has promised you, by having confidence in the truth of His promise and entertaining fear for the Day of Judgement\.

**Part of the Same Sermon: Reminding People of Allah’s Bounties**

He has made for you ears to preserve what is important, eyes to have sight in place of blindness and limbs which consist of many \(smaller\) parts, whose curves are in proportion with the molding of their shapes and lengths of their ages\. He has also given you bodies that sustain themselves and hearts that are busy in search of their food, besides other big bounties, obliging the bestowing \(of His blessings\) and a fortress of safety\. He has fixed for you ages that are not known to you\. He has retained for you remains of the past people for your instruction\. Those people enjoyed themselves fully and were completely unhampered\. Death overtook them before \(satisfaction of\) their desires, from which the hands of death separated them\. They did not provide for themselves during the health of their bodies nor take lessons during the stages of youth\.

Are these people who are in youth waiting for the back\-bending of old age, those enjoying fresh health waiting for ailments and these living persons looking for the hour of death? When the hour of departure comes closer, the journey is at hand with pangs of grief and trouble\. When the suffering of sorrows, suffocation of saliva and the time would arrive for calling relations and friends for help and changing sides on the bed, could then thenear ones stop death, or themourning women do any good? He would rather be left alone in the graveyard confined to thenarrow corner of his grave\.

<a id="page460"></a>His skin has been pierced all over by reptiles and his freshness has been destroyed by these tribulations\. Storms have removed his traces and calamities have obliterated even his signs\. Fresh bodies have turned thin and withe red and bones have become rotten\. The spirits are burdened with the weight of sins and have become conscious of the unknown things\. But now neither the good deeds can be added to nor evil acts can be atoned for by repentance\. Are you not sons, fathers, brothers and relations of these dead and will you not follow their footsteps and pass by their paths? But hearts are still unmoved, heedless of guidance and moving on wrong lines, as though the addressee is someone else and the correct way is to amass worldly gains\.

**Prepare Yourself for the Day of Judgement:**

And be informed that you have to pass over the pathway \(of Sirat\) where steps waver, feet slip, and there are fearful dangers at every step\. O servants of Allah\! Fear Allah like the fearing of a wise man whom the thought \(of next world\) has turned away from other matters\. The fear \(of Allah\) has afflicted his body with trouble and pain, his engagement in the night prayer has turned even his short sleep into awakening, hope \(of eternal recompense\) keeps him thirsty in the day, abstention has curbed his desires and remembrance of Allah is ever moving his tongue\. He entertains fear before dangers\. He avoids uneven ways in favor of clear ones\. He follows the shortest route to secure his purpose, wishfulness does not twist his thinking and ambiguities do not blind his eyes\. He enjoys deep sleep and passes his day happily because of the happiness of good tidings and pleasure of \(eternal bounties\)\.

He passes the pathway of this world in a praiseworthy manner\. He reaches the Hereafter with virtues\. He hastens \(towards virtue\) out of fear \(for vice\)\. He moves briskly during the short time \(of life in this world\)\. He devotes himself in seeking \(eternal good\), he runs away from evil\. During today he is mindful of tomorrow and keeps the future in his view\. Certainly Paradise is the best reward and achievement, which hell is appropriate punishment and suffering\. Allah is the best Avenger and Helper and the Holy Quran is the best argument and the best to confront \(them\)\.

**Warning Against Satan:**

I enjoin upon you fear of Allah Who has left no excuse against what He has warned, has exhausted argument \(of guidance\) about the \(right\) path He has shown\. He has warned you of the enemy that steals

<a id="page461"></a>into hearts and stealthily speaks into ears and thereby misguides and brings about destruction, makes \(false\) promises and keeps under wrong impression\. He represents evil sins in attractive shape and shows as light even serious crimes\. When he has deceived his comrades and exhausted the pledge he begins to find fault with what he presented as good and considers serious what he had shown as light and threatens from what he had shown as safe\.

**Part of the Same Sermon Dealing with Creation of Man**

Or look at man whom Allah has created in the dark wombs and layers of curtains an from what was overflowing semen, then a shapeless clot, then embryo, then a suckling infant, then a child then a fully grown young man\. Then He gave him heart with a memory, a tongue to talk and eyes to see with in order that he may take lesson \(from whatever is around him\), understand, follow the admonition and abstain from evil\.

When he attained the normal growth and his structure gained its average development, he fell in self\-conceit and became perplexed\. He drew buckets of desires, became immersed in fulfilling his wishes for pleasures of the world and his \(sordid\) aims\. He did not fear any evil nor became frightened of any apprehension\. He died infatuated with his vices\. He spent his short life in rubbish pursuits\. He earned no reward nor did he fulfil any obligation\. Fatal illness overtook him while he was still in his enjoyments and perplexed him\. He passed the night in the wakefulness of the hardships of grief and the pricking of pains and ailments\. He suffered in the presence of real brother, loving father, wailing mother and crying sister, while he himself was under a maddening uneasiness, serious senselessness, fearful cries, suffocating pains, anguish of suffocating sufferings and the pangs of death\.

Thereafter, he was clad in the shroud while he remained quiet and thoroughly submissive to others\. Then he was placed on planks in such a state that he had been down\-trodden by hardships and thinned by ailments\. The crowd of young men and helping brothers carried him to his house of loneliness where all connections of visitors are severed\. Thereafter those who accompanied him went away and those who were wailing for him returned\. He was made to sit in his grave for a terrifying questioning and a slippery examination\. The great calamity of that place is the hot water and entry into Hell, flames of eternal Fire and intensity of blazes\. There is no resting period, no gap for ease, no power to intervene, no death to bring about solace and no sleep to make him forget pain\. He

<a id="page462"></a>rather lies under several kinds of deaths and moment\-to\-moment punishment\. We seek refuge with Allah\.

**The Lesson to Be Learned from Those Who Have Passed**

**Away:**

O servants of Allah\! where are those who were allowed \(long\) ages to live and they enjoyed bounty? they were taught and they learned\. They were given time and they passed it in vain\. They were kept healthy and they forgot \(their duty\)\. They were allowed a long period \(of life\), were handsomely provided, were warned of grievous punishment and were promised big rewards\. You should avoid sins that lead to destruction and vices that attract the wrath \(of Allah\)\.

O people who possess eyes and ears, health and wealth\! Is there any place of protection, any shelter of safety, or asylum or haven, or occasion to run away or to come back \(to this world\) ? If not, Ahow are you then turned away \(Holy Quran, 6: 95; 10: 34; 35: 3; 40: 62\) and whither are you averting? By what things have you been deceived? Certainly, the share of everyone of you from this earth is just a piece of land equal to his owns stature and size where he would lie on his cheeks covered with dust\. The present is an opportune moment for acting\.

O servants of Allah\! Since the neck is free from the loop and spirit is also unfettered, now you have time for seeking guidance\. You are in ease of body; you can assemble in crowds, the rest of life is before you; you have opportunity of acting by will; there is opportunity for repentance and peaceful circumstances\. \(But you should act\) before you are overtaken by narrow circumstances and distress, or fear and weakness, before the approach of the awaited death and before seizure by the Almighty, the Powerful\.

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “It is related that when Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) delivered this sermon people began to tremble, tears

flowed from their eyes and their hearts were frightened\. Some people call this sermon the Brilliant Sermon \(al\-Khutbatul\-Gharra’\)\.”

**Sermon 83**

**About Amr ibn al\-As**

<a id="page463"></a>I am surprised at the son of an\-Nabighah that he says among the people of Syria that I am a jester and that I am engaged in frolic and fun\. He said wrong and spoke sinfully\. Beware, the worst speech is what is untrue\. He speaks and lies\. He promises and breaks the promise\. He begs and sticks, but when someone begs from him he withholds miserly\. He betrays the pledge and ignores kinship\.

When in a battle, he commands and admonishes but only until the swords do not come into action\. When such a moment arrives his great trick is to turn naked149

before his adversary\. By Allah, surely the remembrance of death has kept me away from fun and play while obliviousness about the Hereafter has prevented him from speaking truth\. He has not sworn allegiance to Mu\`awiyah without purpose; but has beforehand got him to agree that he would have to pay its price and gave him an award for forsaking religion\.

**Sermon 84**

**About the Perfection of Allah and Counseling**

I testify that there is no god but Allah, He is One and there is no partner with Him\. He is the First, such that nothing was before Him\. He is the Last, such that there is no limit for Him\. Imagination cannot catch any

149Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) here refers to the incident when the

Conqueror of Egypt, Amr ibn al\-As, exhibited the “feat of his courage” by displaying his private parts\! What happened was that when in the battlefield of Siffin he and Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had an encounter, he rendered himself naked in order to ward off the blow of the sword\. At this Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) turned his face away and spared him his life\. The famous Arab poet al\-

Farazdaq said about it: “There is no good in warding off trouble by ignominy as was done one day by Amr ibn al\-As by exposing his private parts\.” Even in this ignoble act \`Amr ibn al\-As had not the credit of doing it himself, but had rather followed another who had preceded him because the man who first adopted this device was Talhah ibn Abu Talhah who had saved his life in the battle of Uhud by becoming naked before Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and so he showed this

way to the others\. Thus, besides Amr ibn al\-As trick was played by Bisr ibn Abu Arta’ah also to save himself from the sword of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\.

When after the performance of this notable deed Bisr went to Mu\`awiyah the latter recalled Amr ibn al\-As act as precedent in order to remove this man’s shamefulness and said, “O Bisr, no matter\. There is nothing to feel shameful about it in view of \`Amr ibn al\-As’s precedent before you\.”

<a id="page464"></a>of His qualities\. Hearts cannot entertain belief about His nature\. Analysis and division cannot be applied to Him\. Eyes and hearts cannot compare Him\.

**Part of the Same Sermon:**

O servants of Allah\! Take lesson from useful items of instruction and shining indications\. Be cautioned by effective items of warning\. Get benefit from preaching and admonition\. It is as though the claws of death are pressed in you, the connection of hope and desires has been cut asunder, hard affairs have befallen you and your march is towards the place where everyone has to go, namely death\. Hence, with every person there is a driver and a witness \(Holy Quran, 50: 21\)\. The driver drives him towards resurrection while the witness furnishes testimony about his deeds\.

**Part of the same sermon \(about Paradise\):**

In Paradise, there are high classes and different abodes\. Its boundary never ends\. He who stays in it will never depart from it\. He who is endowed with everlasting abode in it will not get old and its resident will not face want\.

**Sermon 85**

**About Getting Ready for the next World and Following Allah’s Commandments:**

Allah knows hidden matters and is aware of inner feelings\. He encompasses everything\. He has control over everything and power over everything\. Everyone of you should do whatever he has to do during his days of life before the approach of death\. In its leisure before his occupation and during the breathing of his breath before it is overtaken by suffocation, he should provide for himself and his journey and should collect provisions from his place of halt for his place of stay\.

So remember Allah, O people\! about what He has asked you in His Book to take care of and about His rights that He has entrusted to you\. Verily, Allah has not created you in vain nor left you unbridled nor let you alone in ignorance and gloom\. He has defined what you should leave behind, taught you your acts, ordained your death and sent down the Book \(Holy Quran\) explaining everything \(Holy Quran, 16: 89\)\. He has made His Prophet \(h\) live among you for a long time till He completed for him

<a id="page465"></a>and for you a message sent through the Holy Quran\_\_namely the religion liked and clarified through him His good and evil acts, His prohibitions and His commands\.

He placed before you His arguments and exhausted his excuses upon you\. He put forth to you His promises and warned you of severe retribution\. You should, therefore, make full atonement during your remaining days and let yourselves practice endurance in these days\. These days are fewer as against the many days during which you have shown obliviousness and heedlessness towards admonition\. Do not allow time to yourselves because it will put you on the path of wrong\-doers and do not be easy\-going because this will push you towards sinfulness\.

O servants of Allah\! The best advise for himself is he who is the most obedient to Allah and the most deceiving for himself is he who is the most disobedient to Allah\. Deceived is he who deceived his own self\. Enviable is he whose faith is safe\. Fortunate is he who takes lessons from others, while unfortunate is he who falls victim to his desires\. You should know that even the smallest hypocrisy is like believing in more than one Allah and keeping company of people who follow their desires is the key to obliviousness from religion and is the seat of Satan\.

Be on your guard against falsehood because it is contrary to faith\. A truthful person is on the height of salvation and dignity, while the liar is on the edge of ignominy and degradation\. Do not be jealous because jealousy eats away faith just as fire eats away dried wood\. Do not bear malice because it is a scraper \(of virtues\)\. And know that desires make one forgetful and make memory oblivious\. You should falsify desire because it is a deception and he who has desires is in deceit\.

**Sermon 86**

**Qualities of a Faithful Believer:**

O servants of Allah\! The most fearful of Allah is one whom Allah has given power \(to act\) against his own passions, so that his inner side is \(submerged in\) grief and the outside is covered with fear\. The lamp of guidance is burning in his heart\. He has provided entertainment for the day that is to befall him\. He regards what is distant to be near himself and takes the dark to be light\. He looks at and perceives; he remembers \(Allah\) and enhances \(the tempo of his\) actions\. He drinks sweet water to whose source his way has been made easy\. So he drinks to satisfaction

<a id="page466"></a>and takes the level path\. He has taken off the clothe s of desires and has rid himself of worries except one worry peculiar to him\. He is safe from misguidance and the company of people who follow their passions\. He has become the key to the doors of guidance’ and the lock for the doors of destruction\.

He has seen his way and is walking on it\. He knows his pillar \(of guidance\) and has crossed over his deep water\. He has caught hold of the most reliable supports and the strongest ropes\. He is on that level of conviction which is like the brightness of the sun\. He has set himself for Allah, the Glorified One, for performance of the most sublime acts by facing all that befalls him and takes every step needed for it\. He is the lamp in darkness\. He is the dispeller of all blindness, key to the obscure, remover of complexities and a guide in vast deserts\. When he speaks he \(makes himself understood\) whereas when he remains silent then it is safe to do so\. He does everything only for Allah and so Allah also makes him His own\. Consequently, he is like the mines of His faith and a stump in His earth\. He has enjoined upon himself \(to follow\) justice\.

The first step of his justice is the rejection of desires from his heart\. He describes right and acts according to it\. There is no good which he has not aimed at nor any likely place \(of virtue\) of the Holy Quran\., therefore, the Holy Quran is his guide and leader\. He gets down when the Holy Quran puts down his weight and he settles where the Holy Quran settles him down\.

**Characteristics of an Unfaithful Believer**:

While the other \(kind of\) man is he who calls himself learned but he is not so\. He has gleaned ignorance from the ignorant and misguidance from the misguided\. He has set for the people a trap \(made\) of the ropes of deceit and untrue speech\. He takes the Holy Quran according to his own views and right after his passions\. He makes people feel safe from big sins and takes light the serious crimes\. He says that he is waiting for \(clarification\) of doubts but he remains plunged the rein and that he keeps aloof from innovations but actually he is immersed in them\. His shape is that of a man, but his heart is that of a beast\. He does not know the door of guidance to follow nor the door of misguidance to keep aloof therefrom\. These are the living\-dead bodies\.

<a id="page467"></a>**About the Descendants \(Itra\) of the Holy Prophet \(h\):**

So where are you going?\! \(Holy Quran, 81: 26\); How are you then turned away?\! \(Holy Quran, 6: 95; 10: 34; 35: 3; 40: 62\)\. Ensigns \(of guidance\) are standing, indications \(of virtue\) are clear and the minarets \(of light\) have been fixed\. Where are you being taken astray and how are you groping while you have among you the descendants of the Prophet \(h\) ? they are the reins of Right, ensigns of Faith and tongues of truth\.

Accord to them the same good status as you accord to the Holy Quran and come to them \(for quenching the thirst of guidance\) as the thirsty camels approach the water spring\.

O people take this saying of the last of the prophets that he who dies from among us is not dead and he who decays \(after dying\) from among us does not really decay\. Do not say what you do not understand because most of the Right is in what you deny\. Accept the argument of one against whom you have no argument\. It is I\. Did I not act before you on the greater thiqal \(ath\-thiqal al\-akbar, i\.e\. The Holy Quran\) and did I not retain among you smaller thiqal \(ath\-thiqal al\-asghar, i\.e\. the descendants of the Prophet \[h\]\) ? I fixed among you the standard of faith

and I taught you the limits of lawful and unlawful\. I clothed you with the garments of safety with my justice and spread for you \(the carpet of\) virtue by my words and deeds\.

I showed you high manners through myself\. Do not exercise your imagination about what the eye cannot see or the mind cannot conceive\.

**Part of the Same Sermon about Banu Umayyah:**

Till people begin thinking that the world is attached to the Umayyads, would be showering its benefits to them and lead them to its clear spring for watering and that their whip and sword will not be removed from the people\. Whoever thinks which they would suck for a while then vomit out the whole of it\.

The hadith of the Prophet \(h\) referred to above is a definite proof of the view that the life of any one from among Ahlul\-Bayt \(x\) \(Household of the Holy Prophet \[h\]\) does not come to an end\. It is

apparent that death makes no difference in their sense of living, although the human intelligence is unable to comprehend the conditions and happenings of that life\. There are many truths beyond the world of senses

<a id="page468"></a>which the human mind cannot yet understand\. Who can say how, in the narrow corner of the grave where it is not possible even to breath, replies will be given to the questions of the angels Munkar and Nakir? Similarly, what is the meaning of life of the martyrs in the cause of Allah, who have neither sense nor motion, can neither see nor hear? Although to us they appear to be dead, yet the Holy Quran testifies to their life\.

And say not of those who are slain in the path of Allah that they are dead; Nay, \(they are\) living, but you perceive not\. \(Holy Quran, 2: 154\)

At another place, He \(Allah\) says the following about their life:

Reckon not those who are slain in the way of Allah, to be dead; Nay\! alive they are with their Master being sustained\. \(Holy Quran, 3: 169\)

When restriction has been placed on the minds and tongues even with regard to the common martyrs that they should not be called dead nor considered dead, how would not those individuals whose necks were reserved for swords and plates of poison be living for all times to come?

About their bodies, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has said that by

the passage of time no signs of oldness or decay occur in them, but they remain in the same state in which they fell as martyrs\. There should be nothing strange in it because dead bodies preserved through material means still exit\. When it is possible to do so through material means will it be out of the Power of the Omnipotent Creator to preserve against change and decay the bodies of those upon whom he has bestowed the sense of everlasting life? Thus about the martyrs of Badr, the Holy Prophet \(h\) said the following: “Shroud them even with their wounds

and flowing blood because when they would rise on the Day of Judgement blood would be pushing out of their throats\.”

Al\-thiqal al\-akbar implies the Holy Quran, while Al\-thiqal al\-asghar means Ahl al\-Bayt \(x\) \(Household of the Holy Prophet \[h\]\) as in

the Prophet’s saying: “Verily, I am leaving among you \(the \) two precious things \(of high estimation and of care\), the reference is to Holy Quran and Ahl al\-Bayt \(x\)\.” There are several reasons for using this word\. Firstly,

Al\-thiqal means the kit of a traveller; since the kit is greatly in need, it is protected carefully\. Secondly, it means a precious thing; since this is of a great importance, one is bound to follow the injunctions of the Holy

<a id="page469"></a>Quran and the actions of Ahl al\-Bayt \(x\) in its regard\. So, they have been called “precious things”\. Since Allah has made arrangements for the protection of the Holy Quran and Ahl al\-Bayt \(x\) till the Last Day, they have been called al\-thaqalayn\. The Prophet \(h\), before leaving this world

for the next, declared them to be his valuable possessions, ordering people to safeguard them\. Thirdly, they have been called al\-thaqalayn \(two precious things\) in view of their purity and high value\. Thus ibn Hajar al\-Haytami writes the following:

The Prophet \(h\) has called the Holy Quran and his Descendants

as al\-thaqalayn \(the two precious \[or weighty\] things\) because Al\- thiqal means a pure, chaste and preserved thing and either of these two were really so, each of them is the treasure of the Divine knowledge and a source of scholarly secrets and religious commandments\. For that reason the Prophet \(h\) desired the people to follow them and to stick to them

and to secure knowledge from them\. Among them, the most deserving of attachment is the Imam and Scholar of the family of the Prophet \(h\)

namely Ali ibn Abi Talib \(may Allah honor his face\) because of his great insight and copiousness of knowledge which we have already described; refer to Al\-Sawa’iq al\-Muhriqa, p\.90\.

Since the Prophet \(h\) has, with regard to apparent implication,

attributed the Holy Quran to Allah and the descendants to himself, in keeping with the natural status the Holy Quran has been called the bigger weight while the descendants, the smaller weight\.; otherwise, from the point of view of being followed both are equal and from the point of view of utility in the development of character there can be no question in the status of the speaking party \(Ahl al\-Bayt \[x\]\) being higher than the silent

one \(the Holy Quran\)\.

**Sermon 87**

**About the Division of the Community into Factions:**

So now, certainly, Allah did not break the neck of any unruly tyrant in this world except after allowing him time and opportunity and did not join the broken bone of any people \(umma\) until He did not inflict calamity and distress upon them\. Even less than what sufferings and misfortunes have yet to fall upon you or have already befallen you are

<a id="page470"></a>enough for giving lessons\. Every man with a heart is not intelligent, every ear does not listen and every eye does not see\.

I wonder and there is no reason why I should not wonder, about the faults of these groups who have introduced alterations in their religious pleas, who do not move on the footsteps of their Prophet \(h\)

nor follow the actions of the vicegerent\. They do not believe in the unknown and do not avoid the evil\. They act on the doubts and tread in \(the way of\) their passions\. For them good is whatever they consider good and evil is whatever they consider evil\. Their reliance for resolving distress is on themselves\. Their confidence with regard to dubious matters is on their own opinions as if everyone of them is the Leader \(Imam\) of himself\. Whatever he has decided himself he considers to have been taken from reliable sources and strong factors\.

**Sermon 88**

**About the Holy Prophet \(h\):**

Allah sent the Prophet \(h\) when the mission of other Prophets

had stopped and the peoples were in slumber a long time\. Evils were raising heads, all matters were under disruption and in flames of wars, while the world was devoid of brightness and full of open deceitfulness\. Its leaves had turned yellow and there was absence of hope about its fruits\. Water had gone underground\. The minarets of guidance had disappeared and signs of destruction had appeared\. It was stern to its people and frowned in the face of its seeker\. Its fruit was vice and its food was carcass\. Its inner outfit was fear and outer cover was the sword\.

So take lesson, O servants of Allah, and recall that \(evil doing\) with which your fathers and brothers are entangled and for which they have to account\. By my life, your time is not much behind theirs, nor have long periods or centuries lapsed between you and them, nor are you much distant from when you were in their loins\.

By Allah, whatever the Prophet \(h\) told them, I am here telling

you the same and whatever you hear today is not different from what they heard yesterday\. The eyes that were opened for them and the hearts that were made for them at that time, just the same have been given to you at this time\. By Allah, you have not been told anything that they did not know and you have not been deprived of anything which they were

<a id="page471"></a>deprived of\. Certainly you have been afflicted by a calamity \(which is like

1. she\-camel\) whose nose\-string is moving about and whose strap is loose\. So in whatever condition these deceitful people are should not deceive you because it is just a long shadow whose term is fixed\.

**Sermon 89**

**Allah’s Attributes; Some Other Pieces of Advice:**

Praise be to Allah Who is well\-known without being seen, Who creates without pondering, Who has even been existent when there was no sky with domes, nor curtains with lofty doors, nor gloomy night, nor peaceful ocean, nor mountains with broad pathways, nor curved mountain roads, nor earth of spread floors, nor self\- reliant creatures\. He is the Originator of creation and their Master\. He is the Allah of the creation and its feeder\. The sun and the moon are steadily moving in pursuit of His will\. They make every fresh thing old and every distant thing near\.

He distributed their sustenance and has counted their deeds and acts, the number of their breaths, their concealed looks and whatever is hidden in their bosoms\. He knows their places of stay and places of last resort in the loins and wombs till they reach their end\.

His punishment on the enemies is harsh despite the extent of His Mercy and His compassion toward His friends is vast despite His harsh punishment\. He overpowers one who wants to overcome Him and destroys one who clashes with Him\. He disgraces one who opposes Him and gains sway over one who bears hostility toward Him\. He is sufficient for one who relies on Him\. He gives to one who asks of Him\. He repays one who lends to Him\. He rewards one who thanks Him\.

O servants of Allah\! Weigh yourselves before you are weighed and assess yourselves before you are assessed\. Breath before suffocation of the throat\. Be submissive before you are harshly driven\.

**Sermon 90**

This sermon is known as the sermon of Skeletons150 \(Khutbatul\-Ashbah\), and it holds one of the highest positions among the sermons of

150The name of this sermon is the sermon of _al \-Ashbah_\. _Ashbah_ is the plural of _shabah_ which means skeleton, since it contains a description of angels and other kinds of beings, it has thus been named\. The grounds for being angry

<a id="page472"></a>Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\. Mas\`adah ibn Sadaqah has related from Imam Ja\`far ibn Muhammad as\-Sadiq \(x\) saying: “Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) delivered this sermon from the pulpit of \(the mosque of\) Kufa when someone asked him, ‘O Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\! Describe

Allah for us in such a way that we may imagine that we see Him with eyes so that our love and knowledge may increase about Him\.’ Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) became angry at this \(request of the inquirer\) and ordered the Muslims to gather in the mosque\. So many Muslims gathered in the mosque that the place was over\-crowded\. Imam Ali \(x\) ibn Abu

Talib \(x\) ascended the pulpit while he was still in a state of anger and his color was changed\. Having praised and extolled Allah and sought His blessings on the Prophet \(h\), he said the following:

**About Allah:**

Praise be to Allah Whom refusal to give away and stinginess do not reach and Whom munificence and generosity do not make poor, although everyone who gives away loses \(to that extent\) except He and every miser is blamed for his niggardliness\. He obliges through beneficial bounties and plentiful gifts and grants\. The whole creation is His dependents \(in sustenance\)\. He has guaranteed their livelihood and ordained their sustenance\. He has prepared the way for those who turn to Him and those who seek what is with Him\. He is as generous about what He is asked as He is about that for which He is not asked\. He is the First for whom there was no before so that there could not be anything before Him\. He is the Last for whom there is no after, so that there could not be anything after Him\. Time does not change over Him, so as to admit of any change of condition about Him\. He is not in any place so as to allow Him movement \(from one place to another\)\.

If He gives away all that the mines of the mountains emit of the gold, silver, pearls and cuttings of coral which the shells of the ocean vomit out, it would not affect his munificence, nor diminish the extent of what He has\. \(In fact\) He would still have such treasures of bounty as would not decrease by the demands of the creatures because He is that generous\. Being Whom the begging of beggars cannot make poor nor the pertinacity of those who beseech make miser\.

with the inquirer was that his request was unconnected with the obligations of Shar\`a and beyond the limits of human capacity\.

<a id="page473"></a>**Attributes of Allah as Described in the Holy Quran:**

Then look at the inquirer, be confined to those of His attributes which the Holy Quran had described and seek light from the glory of its guidance\. Leave to Allah that knowledge which Satan has prompted you to seek and which neither the Holy Quran enjoins you to seek nor is there any trace of it in the actions or sayings of the Prophet \(h\) and other

leaders \(Imams\) of guidance\. This is the extreme limit of Allah’s claim upon you\. Be informed that firm in knowledge are those who refrain from opening the curtains that lie against the unknown and their acknowledgment of ignorance about the details of the hidden unknown prevents them from further probing\. Allah praises them for their admission that they are unable to get knowledge not allowed to them\. They do not go deep into the discussion of what is not enjoined upon them about knowing Him and they call it firmness\. Be content with this and do not limit the Greatness of Allah after the measure of your own intelligence, or else you would be among the destroyed ones\.

He is Powerful, such that when the imagination shoots its arrows to comprehend the extremity of His power, the mind, making itself free of the dangers of evil thoughts tries to find Him in the depth of His realm, the hearts long to grasp realities of His attributes and the openings of intelligence penetrate beyond description in order to secure knowledge about His Being, crossing the dark pitfalls of the unknown and concentrating towards him, He would turn them back\. They would return defeated admitting that the reality of His knowledge cannot be comprehended by such random efforts, nor can an iota of the sublimity of His Honor enter the understanding of thinkers\.

**Allah’s Creation:**

He originated the creation without any example which He could follow and without any specimen prepared by any known creator that was before Him\. He showed us the realm of His Might and such wonders which speak of His Wisdom\. The confession of the created things that their existence owes itself to Him made us realize that argument has been furnished about knowing Him \(so that there is no excuse against it\)\. The signs of His creative power and standard of His wisdom are fixed in the wonderful things He has created\. Whatever He has created is an argument in His favor and a guide towards Him\. Even a silent thing is a guide towards Him as though it speaks and its guidance towards the Creator is clear\.

<a id="page474"></a>\(O Allah\!\) I testify that he who likens You with the separateness of the limbs or with the joining of the extremities of his body did not acquaint his inner self with knowledge about You and his heart did not secure conviction to the effect that there is no partner for You\. It is as though he has not heard the \(wrongful\) followers declaiming their false gods by saying, “By Allah\! We are certainly in manifest error when we equaled you with the master of the worlds” \(Holy Quran, 26: 97\-98\)\. They are wrong who liken You to their idols and outfit You with apparel of the creatures by their imagination, attribute to You parts of body by their own thinking and consider You after the creatures of various types, through the working of their intelligence\. I testify that whoever equated You with anything out of Your creation took a match for You and whoever takes a match for You is an unbeliever, according to what is stated in thy unambiguous verses and indicated by the testimony of Your clear arguments\. \(I also testify that\) You are that Allah Who cannot be confined in \(the fetters of\) intelligence so as to admit change of condition by entering its imagination nor in the shackles of mind so as to become limited and an object of alterations\.

**Part of the Same Sermon:**

**About the Greatest Perfection in Allah’s Creation:**

He has fixed limits for everything He has created and has made the limits firm and He has fixed its working and has made the working delicate\. He has fixed its direction and it does not transgress the limits of its status nor fall short of reaching the end of its aim\. It did not disobey when it was commanded to move at His will\. How could it do so when all matters are governed by His will\. He is the Producer of a variety of things without exercise of imagination, without the urge of an impulse hidden in Him, without \(the benefit of\) any experiment taken from the vicissitudes of time and without any partner who might have assisted Him in creating wonderful things\.

Thus, the creation was completed by His order and it bowed to His obedience and responded to His call\. The laziness of any slug or the inertness of any excuse\-finder did not prevent it from doing so\. So He straightened the curves of the things and fixed their limits\. With His power He created coherence in their contradictory parts and joined together the factors of similarity\. Then He separated them in varieties which differ in limits, quantities, properties and shapes\. All this is new

<a id="page475"></a>creation\. He made them firm and shaped them according as He wished and invented them\.

**Part of the same sermon: Description of the Sky:**

He has arranged the depressions and elevations of the openings of the sky\. He has joined the breadths of its breaches and has joined them with one another\. He has made easy the approach to its heights for those \(angels\) who come down with His commands and those \(angels\) who go up with the deeds of the creatures\. He called it when it was yet \(in the form of\) vapor\. At once the links of its joints joined up\. Then Allah opened up its closed door and put the sentinels of meteors at its holes and held them with His hands \(i\.e\. power\) from falling into the vastness of air\.

He commanded it to remain stationary in obedience to His commands\. He made its sun the bright indication for its day and its moon the gloomy indication for its night\. He then put them in motion in their orbits and ordained their \(pace of\) movement in the stages of their paths in order to distinguish with their help between night and day and in order that the reckoning of years and calculations may be known by their fixed movements\. Then He hung in its vastness its sky and put the rein its decoration consisting of small bright pearls and lamp\-like stars\. He shot at the over\-hearers arrows of bright meteors\. He put them in motion on their appointed routine and made them into fixed stars, moving stars, descending stars, ascending stars, ominous stars and lucky stars\.

**Describing the Angels:**

Then Allah, the Glorified One, created for inhabiting of His skies and populating the higher strata of his realm new \(a variety of\) creatures namely the angels\. With them He filled the openings of its cavities and populated them with the vastness of its circumference\. In between the openings of these cavities there resounds the voices of angels glorifying Him in the enclosures of sublimity, \(behind\) curtains of concealment and in veils of His Greatness\. And behind this resounding which deafens the ears there is the glory of light which defies the approach of sight to it and consequently the sight stands, disappointed at its limitation\.

He created them in different shapes and with diverse characteristics\. They have wings\. They glorify the sublimity of His Honor\. They do not appropriate to themselves His skill that shows itself

<a id="page476"></a>in creation\. Nor do they claim they create anything in which He is unparalleled\. “But they are rather honored creatures who do not take precedence over Him in uttering anything and they act according to His command” \(Holy Quran, 21: 26\-27\)\. He has made them the trustees of His revelation and sent them to prophets as holders of His injunctions and prohibitions\. He has immunized them against the waviness of doubts\. Consequently no one among them goes astray from the path of His will\. He has helped them with the benefits of succor and has covered their hearts with humility and peace\. He has opened for them doors of Submission to His Glories\. He has fixed for them bright minarets as signs of His Oneness\. The weights of sins do not burden them and the rotation of nights and days does not make them move\. Doubts do not attack with arrows the firmness of their faith\. Misgivings do not assault the bases of their beliefs\. The spark of malice does not ignite among them\. Amazement does not tarnish what knowledge of Him their hearts possess, or His greatness and awe of His glory that resides in their bosoms\. Evil thoughts do not lean towards them to affect their imagination with their own rust\.

Among them are those who are in the frame of heavy clouds, or in the height of lofty mountains, or in the gloom of over\-powering darkness\. And there are those whose feet have pierced the lowest boundaries of the earth\. These feet are like white ensigns which have gone forth into the vast expanse of wind\. Under them blows the light wind which retains them until its last end\.

Occupation in His worship has made them carefree and realities of Faith have served as a link between them and His knowledge\. Their belief in Him has made them concentrate on Him\. They long for Him not for others\. They have tasted the sweetness of His knowledge and have drunk from the satiating cup of His love\. The roots of His fear have been implanted in the depth of their hearts\. Consequently they have bent their straight backs through His worship\. The length of the humility and extreme nearness has not removed from them the rope of their fear\.

They do not entertain pride so as to make much of their acts\. Their humility before the glory of Allah does not allow them to esteem their own virtues\. Languor does not affect them despite their long affliction\. Their longings \(for Him\) do not lessen so that they might turn away from hope in \(Allah\) their Sustainer\. The tips of their tongues do not get dry by constant prayers \(to Allah\)\. Engagements \(in other matters\) do not betake them so as to turn their \(loud\) voices for Him into faint ones\. Their shoulders do not get displaced in the postures of worship\. They do

<a id="page477"></a>not move their necks \(this and that way\) for comfort in disobedience of His command\. Follies of negligence do not act against their determination to strive and the deceptions of desires do not overcome their courage\.

They regard the master of the Throne \(Allah\) as the store for the day of their need\. Because of their love \(for Him\) they turn to Him even when others turn to the creatures\. They do not reach the ending limit of His worship\. Their passionate fondness for His worship does not turn them except to the springs of their own hearts, springs which are never devoid of His hope and His fear\. Fear of \(Allah\) never leaves them so that they might slacken in their efforts, nor have temptations entrapped them so that they might prefer this light search over their \(serious\) effort\.

They do not consider their past \(virtuous\) deeds as big, for if they had considered them big then fear would have wiped away hopes from their hearts\. They did not differ \(among themselves\) about their Sustainer as a result of Satan’s control over them\. The vice of separation from one another did not disperse them\. Rancor and mutual malice did not overpower them\. Ways of wavering did not divide them\. Differences of degree of courage did not render them into divisions\. Thus they are devotees of faith\. Neither crookedness \(of mind\), nor excess, nor lethargy nor languor breaks them from its rope\. There is not the thinnest point in the skies but there is an angel over it in prostration \(before Allah\) or \(busy\) in quick performance \(of His commands\)\. By long worship of their Sustainer they increase their knowledge and the honor of their Sustainer increases in their hearts\.

**Part of the Same Sermon: Description of the Earth and its**

**Expansion over Water:**

Allah spread the earth on stormy and tumultuous waves and the depths of swollen seas, where waves clashed with each other and high surges leapt over one another\. They emitted foam like the he \-camel at the time of sexual excitement\. So the tumult of the stormy water was subdued by the weight of the earth, when the earth pressed it with its chest its shooting agitation eased and when the earth rolled on it with its shoulder bones the water meekly submitted\. Thus, after tumult of its surges it became tame and overpowered and an obedient prisoner of the shackles of disgrace, while the earth spread itself and became solid in the stormy depth of this water\. \(In this way\) the earth put an end to the pride, self conceit, high status and superiority of the water and muzzled the intrepidity of its flow\. Consequently, it stopped after its stormy flow, settling down after its tumult\.

<a id="page478"></a>When the excitement of water subsided under the earth’s sides and under the weight of the high and lofty mountains placed on its shoulders, Allah flowed springs of water from its high tops and distributed them through plains and low places and moderated their movement by fixed rocks and high mountain tops\. Then its trembling came to a standstill because of the penetration of mountains in \(various\) parts of its surface and their being fixed in its deep areas and their standing on its plains\. Then Allah created the vastness between the earth and firmament and provided the blowing wind for its inhabitants\. Then He directed its inhabitants to spread all over its convenient places\. Thereafter He did not leave the barren tracts of the earth alone where high portions lacked in water\-springs and where rivers could not find their way, but created floating clouds which enliven the unproductive areas and grow vegetation\.

He made a big cloud by collecting together small clouds and when water collected in it and lightning began to flash on its sides and the flash continued under the white clouds as well as the heavy ones He sent it heavily raining\. The cloud was hanging towards the earth and southerly winds were squeezing it into shedding its water like a she\-camel bending down for milking\. When the cloud prostrated itself on the ground and delivered all the water it carried on itself Allah grew vegetation on the plain earth and herbage on dry mountains\. As a result, the earth felt pleased at being decorated with its gardens and wondered at her outfit of soft vegetation and the ornaments of its blossoms\. Allah made all this the means of sustenance for the people and feed for the beasts\. He has opened up highways in its expanse and has established minarets \(of guidance\) for those who tread on its highways\.

**On the Creation of Man and the Sending of the Prophet \(h\):**

Once He had spread out the earth and enforced His commands, He chose Adam \(x\) as the best of His creation, making him the first

\[human being\] to create\. He made him to reside in Paradise and arranged for his eating in it and also indicated from what He had prohibited him\. He told him that proceeding towards it meant His disobedience and endangering his own status\. But Adam did what he had been refrained from, just as Allah already knew beforehand\. Consequently, Allah sent him down after \(accepting\) his repentance, to populate His earth with his progeny and to serve as a proof and plea for Him among his creatures\.

<a id="page479"></a>Even when He made Adam die He did not leave them without one who would serve among them as proof and plea for His Godhead and serve as the link between them and His knowledge\. But He provided to them the proofs through His chosen Messengers and bearers of the trust of His Message, age after age till the process came to end with Prophet Muhammad \(h\) and His pleas and warnings reached finality\.

He ordained livelihoods with plenty and with paucity\. He distributed them narrowly as well as profusely\. He did it with justice to test whomever He desired, with prosperity or with destitution and to test through it the gratefulness or endurance of the rich and the poor\. Then He coupled plenty with the misfortune of destitution, safety with the distresses of calamities and pleasures of enjoyment with pangs of grief\. He created fixed ages and made them long or short and earlier or later, ending them with death\. He had made death capable of pulling up the ropes of ages and cutting them asunder\. He151 knows the secrets of those

151The eloquence with which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has thrown on

Allah’s attributes of knowledge and the sublime words in which he has pictured the all\-engrossing quality of His knowledge cannot but impress the mind of the most die \-hard opponent\. Thus, Ibn Abul\-Hadid has written: “If Aristotle, who believed that God is only aware of the universe and not of its particulars, had heard this speech, his heart, too, would have inclined, his hair would have stood on end, and his thinking would have undergone a dramatic change\.” Do you not see the brightness, force, vehemence, sublimity, glory, seriousness and ripeness of this speech? Besides these qualities, there is sweetness, colorfulness, delicacy and smoothness in it\. I have not found any utterance similar to it\. Of course, if there is any utterance matching it, that can be the word of Allah only\. And there is no wonder in it because he is an offshoot of the same tree \(of the Prophet \(h\)

Ibrahim who set up the Unity of Allah\), a tributary of the same river and a reflection of the same light, as we read in _Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha_, Vol\. 7, pp\. 23\-24\.

Those who regard Allah to possess only overall knowledge argue that since details undergo changes, to believe Him to have knowledge of the changing details would necessitate changes in His knowledge but since knowledge is the same as His Being, His Being would have to be regarded as the object of change the result of which would be that He would have to be taken as having come into existence\. In this way He would lose the attribute of being from ever\. This is a very deceptive fallacy because changes in the object of knowledge can lead to changes in the One Who knows everything only when it is assumed that the One Who knows everything does not already possess knowledge of these changes\. But since all the forms of change and alteration are so strikingly obvious before Him there is no reason that with the changes in the objects of knowledge that He too should be regarded as changeable, although really this change is confined to the object of knowledge and does not affect knowing in itself\.

<a id="page480"></a>who conceal them, the secret conversation of those who engage in it, the inner feelings of those who indulge in guesses, the established certainties, the inklings of the eyes, the inner contents of hearts and the depths of the unknown\. He also knows what can be heard only by bending the holes of the ears, the summer resorts of ants and winter abodes of the insects, resounding of the cries of wailing women and the sound of steps\. He also knows the spots in the inner sheaths of leaves where fruits grow, the hiding places of beasts namely caves in mountains and valleys, the hiding holes of mosquitoes on the trunks of trees and their herbage, the sprouting points of leaves in the branches, the dripping points of semen passing through passages of loins, small rising clouds and the big giant ones, the drops of rain in the thick clouds, the particles of dust scattered by whirlwinds through their skirts, the lines erased by rain floods, the movements of insects on sand\-dunes, the nests of winged creatures on the cliffs of mountains and the singing of chattering birds in the gloom of their brooding places\.

And He knows whatever has been treasured by the mother\-of\-pearls and covered under ocean waves, all that which is concealed under the darkness of night and all that on which the light of day is shining, as well as all that on which sometimes darkness prevails and sometimes light shines, the trace of every footstep, the feel of every movement, the echo for every sound, the motion of every lip, the abode of every living being, the weight of every particle, the sobs of every sobbing heart and whatever is on the earth like fruits of trees or falling leaf, or settling place of semen, or the congealing of blood or clot and the developing of life and embryo\.

On all this, He suffers no trouble and no impediment hampers Him in the preservation of what he created nor any languor or grief hinders Him from the enforcement of commands and management of the creatures, His knowledge penetrates through them and they are within His counting\. His justice extends to all of them and His bounty encompasses them despite their falling short of what is due to Him\.

O Lord\! You deserve handsome description and the highest esteem\. If wish is directed towards You, You are the best to be wished for\. If hope is reposed in You, You are the most Honored to be hoped for\. O Lord\! You hast bestowed on me such power that I do not praise any one other than You and I do not eulogize any one save You\. I do not direct my praise towards others who are sources of disappointment and centers of misgivings\. You hast kept away my tongue from the praises of human beings and eulogies of the created and the sustained\. O Lord\! Every who praises has on whom he praises the right of reward and

<a id="page481"></a>recompense\. Certainly, I have turned to You with my eye at the treasures of Your Mercy and stores of forgiveness\.

O Lord\! here stands one who has singled You with Oneness that is Your due and has not regarded any one deserving of these praises and eulogies except You\. My want towards You is such that nothing except Your generosity can cure its destitution, nor provide for its need except Your obligation and Your generosity\. So do grant us in this place Your will and make us free from stretching hands to anyone other than You\. “Certainly, You are powerful over everything” \(Holy Quran, 66: 8\)\.

Allah is the Guarantor of sustenance and Provider of livelihood as

He says the following:

No creature is there crawling on the earth, but its provision rests on Allah\. \(Holy Quran, 11: 6\)

But His being guarantor means that He has provided ways for everyone to live and earn livelihood and has allowed everyone equal shares in forests, mountains, rivers, mines and in the vast earth and has given everyone the right to make use of them\. His bounties are not confined to any single person, nor is the door of His sustenance closed to any one\. Thus, Allah says the following:

We do aid everyone: These and \(also\) those, out of the bounty of your Lord, and the bounty of your Lord is not confined\. \(Holy Quran, 17: 20\)

If someone does not secure these things through languor or ease and sits effortless, it is not possible that livelihood would reach his door\. Allah has laid the table with multifarious feeds but to get them it is necessary to extend the hand\. He has deposited pearls in the bottom of the sea but it requires diving to get them out\. He has filled the mountains with rubies and precious stones but they cannot be had without digging the stones\. The earth contains treasures of growth but benefit cannot be drawn from them without sowing of seed\. Heaps of edibles lie scattered on all four sides of the earth but they cannot be collected without the trouble of travelling\. Thus, Allah says the following:

Traverse, then, its \(earth’s\) broad sides and eat of His provision\.\(Holy Quran, 67: 15\)

<a id="page482"></a>Allah providing livelihood does not mean that no effort is needed in searching livelihood, or no going out of the house is required, for it and that livelihood should itself finds its way to the seeker\. The meaning of His being the provider of livelihood is that He has given earth the property of growing\. He has sent rain from clouds for germination, created fruits, vegetables and grains\. All this is from Allah but securing them is connected with human effort\. Whoever will strive will reap the benefits of his efforts and whoever abstains from strife would face the consequences of his idleness and laziness\. Accordingly Allah says the following:

And that man shall have nothing but what he strives for\. \(Holy Quran, 53: 39\)

The order of universe hinges on the maxim “You reap what you sow”\. It is wrong to expect germination without sowing, to hope for results without effort\. Limbs and faculties have been given solely to be kept active\. Thus, Allah addressed Mary and says the following:

And shake towards you the trunk of the palm\-tree, it will drop on you dates fresh \(and\) ripe\. Then eat and drink and refresh the eye\. \(Holy Quran, 19: 25\-26\)

Allah provided the means for Mary’s sustenance\. He did not however pluck the dates from the tree and put them in her la, p\. This was because so far as production of food goes it is His concern\. So he made the tree green, put fruits on it and ripened the fruits\. But when the stage arrived for plucking them He did not intervene\. He just recalled to Mary her job namely that she should now move her hand and get her food\.

Again, if His providing the livelihood means that whatever is given is given by Him and whatever is received from Him, then whatever a man would earn and eat and in whatever manner he would obtain it would be permissible for him, whether he obtains it by the ft, bribery, oppression or violence\. It would mean Allah’s act and the food would be that given by Him, wherein he would have no free will and where anything is out of the limits of free action there is no question of permissible or forbidden for it, nor is there any liability to account for it\. But when it is not actually so and there is the question of permissible and forbidden then it should give bearing on human actions, so that it could be questioned whether it was secured in lawful or unlawful actions and manners\. Of course, where He has not bestowed the power of seeking the livelihood, there He has taken upon Himself the responsibility to provide

<a id="page483"></a>the livelihood\. Consequently He has managed for the feeding of the embryo in the mother’s womb and it reaches him there according to its needs and requirements\. But when this very young life enters the wide world and picks up energy to move its limbs, then it can not get its food from the source without moving his lips \(for sucking the milk\)\.

In the management of the affairs of this world, Allah has connected the sequence with the cause of human acts as a result of which the power of action in man does not remain idle\. In the same way He had made these actions dependent on His own will, so man should not rely on his own power of action and forget the Creator\. This is the issue of the will between two wills in the controversy of “free will” versus “compulsion”\. Just as in the entire universe, nature’s universal and sovereign law is in force, in the same way the production and distribution of food also is provided in a set manner under the dual force of the Divine ordainment of human effort\. And this is somewhere less and somewhere more depending on the proportion of human effort and the aim of the Divine ordainment\. Since He is the Creator of the means of livelihood and the powers of seeking food have also been bestowed by Him, the paucity or plenty of livelihood has been attributed to Him because He has fixed different and separate measures for livelihood keeping in view the difference in efforts and actions and the good of the creatures\. Somewhere there is poverty and somewhere affluence, somewhere distress and somewhere comfort and some one is enjoying pleasure while some one else is suffering the hardships of want\.

The Holy Quran says the following:

He amplifies the sustenance of whomsoever He pleases and straitens; Verily, He knows all things\. \(Holy Quran, 42: 12\)

In sermon 23, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) refers to this matter

thus: “The Divine command descends from the sky towards the earth with whatever is ordained for everyone, whether less or more, just like rain drops\.

So, there is a fixed process and manner for the benevolence of rain namely that vapors rise from the sea with the store of water, spread over in the sky in the shape of dark clouds then ooze the water by drops till they form themselves in regular lines\. They irrigate plains as well as high lands thoroughly and proceed onwards to collect in the low areas, so that the thirsty may drink it, animals may use it and dry lands may be watered from it\. In the same way Allah has provided all the means of

<a id="page484"></a>livelihood but His bounty follows a particular mode in which there is never a jot of deviation\. Thus, Allah says the following:

And there is not a thing but with Us are its treasures and We do not send it down but in a known measure\. \(Holy Quran, 15: 21\)

If man’s greed and avarice exceeds its bounds, then just as an excess of rain ruins crops instead of growing and bringing them up, so the abundance of the articles of livelihood and the necessities of life would make man obvious of Allah and rouse him to rebellion and unruliness\. Consequently, Allah says the following:

And should Allah amplify the sustenance unto his servants, they would certainly rebel in the earth, but He sends it down by measure as He pleases; Verily of His servants, He is All\-aware, All\-seeing\. \(Holy Quran, 42: 27\)

If He lessens the food then just as a drought makes the land arid and kills the animals, likewise, by closure of the means of livelihood, the human society would be destroyed and so there would remain no means of living and livelihood\. Allah accordingly says the following:

Or who is that who can provide you with sustenance should He withhold His sustenance?\(Holy Quran, 67: 21\)

Consequently, Allah, the Wise, the Omniscient, has put the organization for livelihood on moderate and proportionate lines and in order to emphasize the importance of livelihood and sustenance and to keep them correlated with each other has introduced differences in the distribution of livelihood\. Sometimes, this difference and unequal distribution owes itself to the difference of human effort and sometimes it is the consequence of overall arrangement of the affairs of the Universe and the Divine acts of wisdom and objectives\. This is so because, if by poverty and want He has tested the poor in endurance and patience, in affluence and wealth there is severe test of the rich by way of thanksgiving and gratifying the rights of others, namely whether the rich person gratifies the claims of the poor and the distressed and whether he takes care of the destitute or not\. Again, where there is wealth there would also be dangers of all sorts\. Sometimes there would be danger to the wealth and property and sometimes fear of poverty and want\.

Consequently, there would be many persons who would be more satisfied and happy for lack of wealth\. For them this destitution and want

<a id="page485"></a>would be far better than the wealth which might snatch away their comfort and peace\. Moreover sometimes this very wealth which one holds dearer than life becomes the cause of loss of one’s life\. Further, it has also been seen that for as long as wealth was lacking character was above reproach, life was unblemished, but the moment property and wealth changed into plenty the conduct worsened, character became faulty and there appeared the vices of Awine, women and wealth\. In such cases the absence of wealth was a blessing\. However being ignorant of Allah’s objectives man cries out and being affected by transitory distress begins complaining but does not realize from how many vices which could have accrued owing to wealth he has remained aloof\. Therefore, if wealth produces conveniences, poverty serves as a guard for the character\.

**Sermon 91**

**When People Decided to Swear Allegiance to Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib’s Hand after the Murder of Othman, He Said the Following:**

Leave me and seek someone else\. We are facing a matter which has \(several\) faces and colors, which neither hearts can stand nor intelligence can accept\. Clouds are hovering over the sky and faces are not discernable\. You should know that if I respond to you I would lead you as I know and would not care about whatever one may say or abuse\. If you leave me then I am the same as you are\. It is possible I would listen to and obey whomever you make in charge of your affairs\. I am better for you as a counselor than as chief\.

With the murder of Othman, the caliphate became vacant and Muslims began to look at Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) whose peaceful

conduct, adherence to principles and political acumen had been witnessed by them to a great extent during this long period\. Consequently they rushed to swear allegiance on his righteousness in much the same way a traveler who had lost his way, then finding it again rushes towards his destination, as the historian al\-Tabari \(in Tarikh, Vol\. 1, pp\. 3066, 3067, 3076\) records the following: “People thronged around Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and said, “We want to swear the oath of allegiance to you; you

can see what troubles have befallen Islam and how we are being tried with regard to the near in kin of the Prophet \(h\)\.”

<a id="page486"></a>But Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) declined to accede to their

request whereupon these people raised hue and cry and began to shout loudly, “O Abul\-Hassan\! Do you not witness the ruination of Islam or see the advancing flood of unruliness and mischief? Do you have no fear of Allah?\!” Even Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) showed no readiness to consent because he was noticing that the effects of the atmosphere that had come into being after the Prophet \(h\) had overcome hearts and

minds of the people\. Selfishness and lust for power had become rooted in them, their thinking had become affected by materialism and they had become habituated to treating government as the means for securing their ends\. Now they would like to materialize the Divine Caliphate too and play with it\. In these circumstances it would be impossible to change the mentalities or turn their direction of temperaments\. In addition to these ideas he had also seen the end in sight, that these people should have further time to think on it so that on frustration of their material ends hereafter they should not say that the allegiance had been sworn by them under a temporary expediency and timely thought and that nature \(rational\) thought had not been given to it, just as \`Omer’s idea was about the first caliphate, which appears from his statement that: “bu Bakr’s caliphate came into being without due thought, but Allah saved us from its mischief\. If anyone repeats such an affair, you should kill him, as stated in \\sect fs22 Sahih al\- Bukhari, Vol\. 8, pp\.210, 211; in Al\-Musnad of Imam Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Vol\. 1, p\.55; in al\- Tabari, Vol\. 1, p\.1822; in Ibn al\-Athir, Vol\. 2, p\.327; in Ibn Hisham, Vol\. 4, pp\.308\-309, and in Ibn Kathir, Vol\. 5, p\.246\.

In short, when their insistence increased beyond limits, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) delivered this sermon wherein he clarified that: If you

want me for your worldly ends, then I am not ready to serve as your instrument\. Leave me and select someone else who may fulfil your ends\. You have seen my past life that I am not prepared to follow anything except the Holy Quran and Sunnah and would not give up this principle for securing power\. If you select someone else I would pay regard to the laws of the state and the constitution as a peaceful citizen should do\. I have not at any stage tried to disrupt the collective existence of the Muslims by inciting rebellion\. The same will happen now\. Rather, just as keeping the common good in view I have hitherto been giving correct advice, I will not grudge doing the same\. If you put me in the same status, it will be better for your worldly ends because in that case I will not have power in my hands so that I could stand in the way of your worldly affairs and create impediment against your heart’s wishes\. However, if you are determined to swear the oath of allegiance to me, then bear in mind that if

<a id="page487"></a>you frown or speak against me, I will force you to tread on the path of right and in the matter of the right I will not care for anyone\. If you want to swear the oath of allegiance even at this, you can satisfy your wish\.”

The impression Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had formed about

those people is fully corroborated by later events\. Consequently, when those who had sworn allegiance with worldly motives did not succeed in their objectives they broke away and rose against his government with baseless allegations\.

**Sermon 92**

**About the Annihilation of the Kharijites, Themischief Mongering of Umayyads and the Vastness of His Knowledge:**

So now, Praise and Glorification belong to Allah\. O people\! I have put out the eye of rebellion\. No one except me advanced towards it when its gloom was swelling and its madness was intense\. Ask me before

152Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) delivered this sermon after the battle of

Nahrawan\. In it, “mischiefs” implicitly refers to the battles fought in Basra, Siffin and Nahrawan because their nature was different from the battles of the Prophet \(h\)\. There the opposite party was the unbelievers while here the confrontation

was with those who had veils of Islam on their faces\. So people were hesitant to fight against Muslims and said why they should fight with those who recited the call to the prayers and offered the prayers\. Thus, Khuzaymah ibn Thabit al\-Ansari did not take part in the Battle of Siffin till the falling of Ammar ibn Yasir as martyr did not prove the opposite party was rebellious\. Similarly the presence of companions like Talhah and az\-Zubayr who were included in the Foretold Ten on the side of Aisha in Basra and the prayer signs on foreheads of the Kharijites in Nahrawan and their prayers and worships were creating confusion in the minds\. In these circumstances only those could have the courage to rise against them were aware of the secrets of their hearts and the reality of their faith\. It was the peculiar perception of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and his spiritual courage

that he rose to oppose them and testified to the saying of the Holy Prophet \(h\):

“You will fight after me with the breakers of allegiance \(people of Jamal\), oppressors \(people of Syria\) and deviators \(the Kharijites\) as we read in the following references*: “Al\-Mustadrak Ala as\-Sahihayn*, al\-Hakim, Vol\. 3, pp\.139\-40; _Al\-Durr al\-Manthur_, Vol6, p\.18; _Al\-Isti\`ab_, Vol\. 3, p\.1117; _Usd al\-Ghaba_, Vol\. 4 pp\.32, 33; _Tarikh Baghdad_, Vol\. 8, p\.340; Vol\. 13, p\. 186, 187; _Tarikh,_ _Ibn Asakir_, Vol\. 5, p\. 41;_ Tarikh Ibn Kathar_, Vol\. 7, pp\. 304\-6;_ Majma\` az\-Zawa’id_, Vol\. 7, p\. 238; Vol\. 9, p\. 235;_ Sharh al\-Mawahib_, Vol\. 3, pp\. 316\-317;_ Kanz al\-Ummal_, Vol\. 6, pp\.72,82,88,155,319,391,392; Vol\. 8, p\.215\.

<a id="page488"></a>you miss me,153 because, by Allah, who has my life in His hands, if you ask me anything between now and the Day of Judgement or about the group who will guide a hundred people and also misguide a hundred people, I will tell you who is announcing its march, who is driving it in the front and who is driving it at the rear, the stages where its riding animals will stop for rest and the final place of stay and who among them will be killed and who will die a natural death\.

When I am dead hard circumstances and distressing events will befall you\. Many persons in the status of asking questions will remain silent with eyes cast down while those in the status of replying will lose courage\. This will be at a time when wars will descend upon you with all hardship and days will be so hard on you that you will feel them prolonged because of hardship till Allah will give victory to those remaining virtuous among you\.

153After the Holy Prophet \(h\) no one except Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) could

utter the challenge\. Ask whatever you want to\. ibn Abdul\-Barr in Jami Bayan al\-Ilm wa fadlihi, Vol\. 1, p\.58 and in _Al\-Isti\`ab_, Vol\. 3, p\.1103; Ibn al\-Athi

1. in _Usd al\-Ghaba_, Vol\. 4, p\.22; Ibn Abul\-Hadid in _Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha_, Vol7, p\. 46; as\-Sayyuti in _Tarikh al\-Khulafa’_, p\.171 and ibn Hajar al\-Haytami in _Al\-Sawa’iq al\-Muhriqa_, p\.76 have written that “None among the companions of the\* \*Holy Prophet \(h\) ever said, ‘Ask me whatever you want’ except Ali ibn Abu

Talib\.” However, among other than the companions a few names do appear in history who did utter such a challenge, such as Ibrahim ibn Hisham al\-Makhzumi, Muqatil ibn Sulayman, Qaradah ibn Di’amah, Abd ar\-Rahman \(Ibn al\-Jawzi\) and Muhammad ibn Idris ash\-Shafi’i etc\. but everyone of them faced disgrace and was forced to take back his challenge\. This challenge can be urged only by him who knew the realities of the universe and is aware of the happenings of the future\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) the opener of the door of

the Prophet’s knowledge as he was, was the only person who was never seen being unable to answer any question on any occasion\. This was so much so that even \`Umar had to say that AI seek Allah’s protection from the difficulty for the solution of which Ali will not be available\. Similarly, the prophesies of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) made about the future proved true word\-for\-word and served as

an index to his vast knowledge, whether they be about the devastation of Banu Umayyah, of the risings of the Kharijites, the wars and destruction by the Tatars, of the attacks of the English, the floods of Basra and the ruination of Kufa\. In short when these events are historical realities there is no reason why this challenge of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) should be wondered at\.

<a id="page489"></a>When mischief comes they confuse \(right with wrong\) and when they clear away they leave a warning\. They cannot be known at the time of approach but are recognized at the time of return\. They blow like the blowing of winds, striking some cities and missing others\.

Beware that the worst mischief for you in my view is the mischief of Banu Umayyah because it is blind and also creates darkness\. Its sway is general but its ill effects are for particular people\. He who remains clear\-sighted in it will be affected by distress and he who remains blind in it will avoid the distress\. By Allah, after me you will find Banu Ummayyah the very worst for yourselves, like the old unruly she\-camel who bites with its mouth, beats with its fore\-legs, kicks with its hind legs and refuses to be milked\. They will remain over you till they will leave among you only those who benefit them or those who do not harm them\. Their calamity will continue till your seeking help from them will become like the seeking of help by the slave from his master or of the follower from the leader\.

Their mischief will come to you like evil\-eyed fear and pre\-Islamic fragments, wherein there will be no minaret of guidance nor any sign \(of salvation\) to be seen\. We Ahl al\-Bayt \(x\) \(the Household of the

Prophet \(h\)\) are free from this mischief and we are not among those who

will engender it\. Thereafter, Allah will dispel it from you like the removal of the skin \(from flesh\) through him who will humble them, drag them by their necks, make them drink full cups \(of hardships\), not extend to them anything but sword and not clothe them except with fear\. At that time Quraish will wish at the cost of the world and all its contents to find me even only once and just for the duration of the slaughter of a camel in order that I may accept from them \(the whole of\) that of which at present\. I am asking them only a part but they are not giving me\.

**Sermon 93**

**Praising Allah and Lauding His Prophets:**

Exalted is Allah Whom heights of daring cannot approach and fineness of intelligence cannot find\. He is such First that there is no extremity for Him so that He be contained within it, nor is there an end for Him where He will cease \(being Existent\)\.

<a id="page490"></a>**Part of the Same Sermon about the Prophet \(h\):**

Allah kept the Prophets in the best place and made them stay in the best of way\. He moved them in succession from distinguished forefathers to the wombs of chaste women\. Whenever a predecessor from among them died, the follower stood up for the cause of the religion of Allah\.

**About the Holy Prophet \(h\) and his Descendants \(Itra\):**

\.\.\. until this elevation of status by Allah, the Glorified One, reached Muhammad \(h\)\. Allah brought him out of the most

distinguished sources of origin and the most honorable places of planting, namely from the same \(lineal\) tree from which He brought forth other Prophets and from which He selected His trustees\. Muhammad’s descendants are the best descendants, his kinsmen the best of kin and his lineal tree the best of trees\. It grew in esteem and rose in distinction\. It has tall branches and unapproachable fruits\.

He is the leader \(Imam\) of all who are steadfast in your fear \(of Allah\) and the light for all those who seek guidance\. He is a lamp whose flame is burning, a meteor whose light is shining and a flint whose spark is bright\. His conduct is upright, his behavior is guiding, his speech is decisive and his decision is just\. Allah sent him after an interval from the previous Prophets when people had fallen into errors of action and ignorance\. May Allah have mercy on you\.

May Allah shower His mercy on you\! Do act according to the clear signs because the way is straight and leads to the house of safety while you are in the place of seeking Allah’s favor and have time and opportunity\. The books \(of your doings\) are open and pens \(of angels\) are busy \(to record your actions\) while your bodies are healthy, tongues are free, repentance is accepted and deeds are accorded recognition\.

**Sermon 94**

**About the Condition of the People at the Time of the Prophet’s Proclamation and about His Actions Having to Do with the Dissemination of His Message:**

<a id="page491"></a>Allah sent the Prophet \(h\) at a time when the people were going

astray in perplexity and were moving here and there in mischief\. Desires had deflected them and self\-conceit had swerved them\. Extreme ignorance had made them foolish\. They were confounded by the unsteadiness of matters and the evils of ignorance\. Then the Prophet \(h\)

did his best in giving them sincere advice, himself trod on the right path and called \(them\) towards wisdom and good counsel\.

**Sermon 95**

**In Praise of Allah and of the Holy Prophet \(h\):**

Praise be to Allah Who is the First: nothing is before Him, and He is the Last, nothing is there after Him\. He is such Manifest that there is nothing above Him and such Hidden that there is nothing nearer than He\.

**Part of the Same Sermon about the Holy Prophet \(h\):**

His place of stay is the best of all places and his origin the noblest of all origins in the minds of honor and the cradles of safety\. Hearts of virtuous persons have been inclined towards him and the reins of eyes have been turned towards him\. Through him, “Allah buried mutual rancor and put off the flames of rebellion\. Through him He gave them affection like brothers and separated those who were together \(through unbelief\)\. His speaking is clear and his silence is \(indicative of\) the tongue\.

154In the atmosphere that had been created soon after the Prophet \(h\), Ahl al\-Bayt \(x\) \(members of his family\) had no course except to remain secluded

resulting in the world’s continued ignorance of their real qualities and being acquainted with their teachings and attainments\. To belittle them and keep them away from authority has been considered as the greatest service to Islam\. If Othman’s open misdeeds had not given a chance to the Muslims to wake up and open their eyes there will have been no question of allegiance to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and temporal authority will have retained the same course as it had

so far followed\. But all those who could be named for the purpose had no courage to come forward because of their own shortcomings while Mu\`awiyah was sitting in his capital away from the center\. In these circumstances there was none except Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) who could be looked at\. Consequently

people’s eyes hovered around him and the same common people who, following the direction of the wind, had been swearing allegiance to others jumped at him

<a id="page492"></a>

**Sermon 96**

**Ali \(x\) Admonishing His Companions :**

for swearing allegiance\. Nevertheless, this allegiance was not on the count that they regarded his Caliphate as from Allah and him as an Imam \(The Divine Leader\) to obey as obligatory\. It was rather under their own principles which were known as democratic or consultative\. However, there was one group who was swearing allegiance to him as a religious obligation regarding his Caliphate as determined by Allah\. otherwise, the majority regarded him a ruler like the other Caliphs and as regarding precedence, on the fourth status, or at the level of the common men after the three caliphs\. Since the people, the army and the civil servants had been impressed by the beliefs and actions of the previous rulers and immersed in their ways whenever they found anything against their liking they fretted and frowned, evaded war and were ready to rise in disobedience and rebellion\. Furthermore, just as among those who fought in _jihad_ on the side of the Prophet \(h\), there were some seekers of this world and others of the Hereafter\.

Now, in the same way, there was no dearth of worldly men who were, in appearance, with Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) but actually they had connections with Mu\`awiyah who has promised some of them positions and had extended to others temptation of wealth\. To hold them as Sh\`as of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and to blame Shi\`ism for this reason is closing the eyes to facts because the beliefs of these people will be the same as of those who regarded Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) fourth in the series\. Ibn Abul\-Hadid throws light on the beliefs of these persons in clear words:

Whoever observes minutely the events during the period of Caliphate of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) will know that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had been

brought to bay because those who knew his real status were very few\. The swarming majority did not bear that belief about him which was obligatory to have\. They gave precedence to the previous Caliphs over him and held that the criterion of precedence was Caliphate\. In this matter, those coming later followed the predecessors and argued that if the predecessors had not the knowledge that the previous Caliphs had precedence over Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) they will

not have preferred them to him\. Rather, these people knew and took Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) as a citizen and subject\. Most of those who fought in his

company did so on grounds of prestige or Arab partisanship, not on the ground of religion or belief, as we read on p\. 72, Vol\. 1 of _Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha_\.

<a id="page494"></a>Although Allah gives a respite to the oppressor, His might does not spare him\. Allah takes hold of him on the passage of his way and the status of that which suffocates the throats\.

By Allah in Whose power my life lies\! These people \(Mu\`awiyah and his men\) will overcome you not because they have a better right than you but because of their hastening towards the wrong with their leader and your slowness about my right \(to be followed\)\. People are afraid of the oppression of their rulers while I fear the oppression of my subjects\.

I called you forward but you did not come\. I warned you but you did not listen\. I called you secretly as well as openly, but you did not respond\. I gave you sincere counsel, but you did not accept it\. Are you present like the absent and slaves like masters? I recite before you points of wisdom but you turn away from them and I admonish you with far reaching advice but you disperse away from it\. I rouse you for jihad against the people of rebellion but before I come to the end of my speech, I see you disperse like the sons of Saba\.156 You return to your places and deceive one another by your counsel\. I straighten you in the morning but you are back to me in the evening as curved as the back of a bow\. The one who straightens has become weary while those to be straightened have become incorrigible\.

O those whose bodies are present but wits are absent and whose wishes are scattered and their rulers are on trial\. Your leader obeys Allah but you disobeyed him while the leader of the people of Syria disobeys Allah but they obey him\. By Allah, I wish Mu\`awiyah will exchange with me dinars for dirhams, so that he gives from me ten of you and gives me one from them\.

people of Kufa\! I have experienced in you three things and two others: you are deaf in spite of having ears, dumb in spite of speaking and blind in spite of having eyes\. You are neither true supporters in combat nor dependable brothers in distress\. Your hands may be soiled with earth\. O examples of those camels whose herdsman has disappeared, if they are

156The progeny of Saba’ ibn Yashjub ibn Ya\`rub ibn Qahtan is known as the tribe of Saba’ \[in English, Sheba\]\. When these people began to falsify prophets, to shake them, Allah sent a flood of water by which their gardens were submerged and they left their houses and property to settle down in different cities\. This proverb arose out of this event and it is now applied wherever people so disperse that there be no hope of their joining together again\.

<a id="page495"></a>collected together from one side they disperse from the other\. By Allah, I see you in my imagination that if war becomes intense and action is in full swing you will run away from the son of Abu Talib like the woman who becomes naked in the front\. I am certainly on clear guidance from my Master \(Allah\) and on the path of my Prophet \(h\) and I am on the right

path which I adhere to regularly\.

**About the Household of the Holy Prophet \(h\):**

Behold the people of the Prophet’s family\! Adhere to their direction\. Follow their footsteps because they will never let you out of guidance and never throw you into destruction\. If they sit down, you sit down and if they rise up you rise up\. Do not go ahead of them, as you will thereby go astray and do not lag behind them as you will thereby be ruined\.

I have seen the companions of the Prophet \(h\) but I do not find

anyone resembling them\. They began the day with dust on the hair and face \(in hardship of life\) and passed the night in prostration and standing in prayers\. Sometimes they put down their foreheads and sometimes their cheeks\. With the recollection of their resurrection it seemed as though they stood on live coals\. It seemed that in between their eyes there were signs like knees of goats, resulting from long prostrations\. When Allah was mentioned their eyes flowed freely till their shirt collars were drenched\. They trembled for fear of punishment and hope of reward as the tree trembles on the day of stormy wind\.

**Sermon 97**

**Oppressiveness of the Umayyads:**

By Allah\! They will continue like this till there will remain no unlawful act before Allah except that they will make it lawful, nor a pledge except that they will break it and till there will remain no house of bricks or of woolen tent but their oppression will enter it\. Their bad dealings will make them wretched, till two groups of crying complainants will rise\. One will cry for his religion and the other for this world and the help of one of you to one of them will be like the help of a slave to his master, namely when he is present he obeys him, but when the master is away he backbites him\. The highest among you in distress will be he who bears best belief about Allah\. If Allah grants you safety accept it and if you are put in trouble endure it because surely \(good\) result is for the God\-fearing\.

<a id="page496"></a>

**Sermon 98**

**About Abstinence from the World and Vicissitudes of Time:**

We praise Allah for what has happened and seek His succor in our affairs for what is yet to happen and we beg Him for safety in the faith just as we beg Him for safety in our bodies\.

O servants of Allah\! I admonish you to keep away from this world which will \(shortly\) leave you even though you do not like its departure and which will make your bodies old even though you will like to keep them fresh\. Your example and its example is like the travelers who travel some distance then as though they traverse it quickly or they aimed at a sign and reached it at once\. How short is the distance to the aim if one heads towards it and reaches it\. And how short is the stage of one who has only a day which he cannot exceed while a swift driver is driving him in this world till he departs from it\.

So do not hanker after worldly honor and its pride and do not feel happy over its beauties and bounties nor wail over its damages and misfortune because its honor and pride will end while its beauty and bounty will perish and its damages and misfortunes will pass away\. Every period in it has an end and every living being in it is to die\. Is there not for you a warning in the relics of the predecessors and an eye opener and lesson in your forefathers, provided you understand?

Do you not see that your predecessors do not come back and the surviving followers do not remain? Do you not observe that the people of the world pass mornings and evenings in different conditions? Thus, \(somewhere\) the dead is wept for, someone is being condoled, someone is prostrate in distress, someone is inquiring about the sick, someone is passing his last breath, someone is hankering after the world while death is looking for him\. Someone is forgetful but he is not forgotten \(by death\) and on the footsteps of the predecessors walk the survivors\.

Beware\! At the time of committing evil deeds remember the destroyer of joys, the spoiler of pleasures and the killer of desires \(namely death\)\. Seek assistance of Allah for fulfillment of His obligatory rights and for \(thanking Him\) for His countless bounties and obligations\.

<a id="page497"></a>

**Sermon 99**

**About the Holy Prophet \(h\) and his Descendants :**

Praise be to Allah Who spreads His bounty throughout the creation and extends His hand of generosity among them\. We praise Him in all His affairs and seek His assistance for fulfillment of His rights\. We testify that there is no god except He and that Muhammad \(h\) is His

slave and Prophet \(h\)\. He sent him to manifest His commands and speak

about His remembrance\. Consequently, he fulfilled it with trustworthiness and he passed away while on the right path\.

He left among us the standard of right\. Whoever goes further from it goes out of faith, whoever lags behind it is ruined\. Whoever sticks to it will join \(the right\)\. Its guide is short of speech, slow of steps and quick when he rises\. When you have bent your necks before him and pointed towards him with your fingers his death will occur and will take him away\. They will live after him as long as Allah wills till Allah brings out for you one who will collect you together and fuse you after diffusion\. Do not place expectation in one who does not157 come forward and do not lose hope in one who is veiled because it is possible that one of the two feet of the veiled one may slip while the other may remain sticking, till both return to status and stick\.

Beware\! The example of the descendant of Muhammad \(h\) is

like that of stars in the sky\. When one star sets another rises\. So you are in a status that Allah’s blessings on you have been perfected and He has shown you what you once wished for\.

**Sermon 100**

**About the Vicissitudes of Time :**

He \(Allah\) is the First before every first and the Last after every last\. His Firstness necessitates that there is no \(other\) first before Him and His Perpetuity necessitates that there is no other to last after Him\. I do

157The implication is that if for the time being your expectations are not being fulfilled, you should not be disappointed\. It is possible matters may improve, the impediments in the way of improvement may be removed and matters may be settled as you wish\.

<a id="page498"></a>testify, both openly as well as secretly, with heart as well as with tongue, that there is no god but Allah\.

O people\! do not commit the crime of opposing me, do not be seduced into disobeying me and do not wink at each other with eyes when you hear me\. By Allah, Who germinates the seed and blows the wind, whatever I convey to you is from the Prophet \(h\)\. Neither the conveyor

\(of Allah’s message, i\.e\. The Prophet \[h\]\) lied, nor the hearer misunderstood\.

Well, it is as though I see a misguided man158 who is shouting in Syria and has put his banners in the outskirts of Kufa\. When his mouth will be fully opened, his recalcitrance will become intense and his steps on earth will become heavy \(and tyrannical\) then the disorder \(so created\) will cut the people with its teeth and war will rage with \(all\) its waves\. Days will become severe and nights full of toil\. So when the crops grow and stand on stalks, its foam shoots forth and its lightning shines, the banners of misguiding rebellion will fire up and shoot forth like darkening night and surging sea\. This and how many other storms will rend Kufa and gales will sweep over it? Shortly, heads will clash with heads, the standing crop will be harvested and the harvest will be smashed\.

**Sermon 101**

**On the Same Subject: The Day of Judgement :**

That Day will be such that Allah will collect on it the interiors and the posteriors, to stand in obedience for exaction of accounts and for award of recompense for deeds\. Sweat will flow to their mouths like rains while the earth will be trembling under them\. In the best condition among them will be he who has found a resting place for both his feet and an open place for his breath\.

**Part of the same sermon about future troubles \(fitan\):**

The troubles are like a dark night\. Horses will not stand for \(facing\) them nor will their banners turn back\. They will approach in full reins and ready with saddles\. Their leader will be driving them and the

158Some people have taken this to refer to Mu\`awiyah, while others see it as a reference to \`Abdul\-Malik ibn Marwan\.

<a id="page499"></a>rider will be exerting \(them\)\. The trouble\-mongers are a people whose attacks are severe\. Those who will fight them for the sake of Allah will be a people who are low in the estimation of the proud, unknown in the earth but well known on the sky\. Woe to you O Basra, when an army of Allah’s infliction will face you without \(raising\) their dust of cries\! Your inhabitants will then face bloody death and a dire hunger\.

**Sermon 102**

**About Gluttony, Fear of Allah :**

O people\! Look at the world like those who abstain from it and turn away from it\. By Allah, it will shortly turn out its inhabitants and cause grief to the happy and the safe\. That which turns and goes away from it never returns and that which is likely to come about is not known or anticipated\. Its joy is mingled with grief\. Herein men’s firmness inclines towards weakness and languidness\. The majority of what pleases you here should not mislead you because that which will help you will be little\.

Allah may shower His mercy on him who ponders and takes lesson thereby and when he takes lesson he achieves enlightenment\. Whatever is present in this world will shortly not exist, while whatever is \(perceived\) to Exist in the Hereafter is already in existence\. Every countable thing will pass away\. Every anticipation should be taken to be coming up and everything that is to come up should be taken as just near\.

**Part of the Same Sermon on the Attributes of a Learned Person:**

Learned is he who knows his worth\. It is enough for a man to remain ignorant if he knows not his worth\. Certainly, the most hated man with Allah is he whom Allah has left for his own self\. He goes astray from the right path and moves without a guide\. If he is called to the plantation of the Hereafter he is slow\. As though what he is active for is obligatory upon him whereas in whatever he is slow was not required of him\.

**Part of the same sermon about future times:**

There will be a time wherein only a sleeping \(inactive\) believer will be safe \(such that\) if he is present he is not recognized but if he is

<a id="page500"></a>absent he is not sought after\. These are the lamps of guidance and banners of night journeys\. They do not spread calumnies nor divulge secrets, nor slander\. They are those for whom Allah will open the doors of His mercy and keeps off from them the hardships of His chastisement\.

O people\! Time will come when Islam will be capsized as a pot is capsized with all its contents\. O people\! Allah has protected you from that\. He might be hard on you but He has not spared you from being put on trial\. Allah the most Sublime of all speakers has said the following:

Verily in this are signs and We do only try \(the people\)\. \(Holy Quran, 23: 30\)

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “As regarding Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s words Akullu Mu’minin nuwamah \(every sleeping believer\), he implies thereby one who is talked of little and causes no evil\. And the word “al\-masayth” is the plural of “misyah”\. He is one who spreads trouble among people through evils and calumny\. And the word al\-madhayi is the plural of “midhya”\. He is one who upon hearing of an evil about some one spreads it and shouts about it\. And al\-budhur is the plural of badur\. He is one who excels in foolishness and speaks rubbish\.

**Sermon 103**

**About the Condition of the People Before the Proclamation of Prophethood and the Prophet’s Performance in Spreading His Message :**

So now, certainly Allah deputed Muhammad \(h\) as the Prophet \(h\) while no one among the Arabs read the Book nor claimed

Prophethood or revelation\. He had to fight those who disobeyed him in the company with those who followed him, leading them towards their salvation and hastening with them lest death overtake them\. When any weary person sighed or a distressed one stopped, he stood with him till he got him his desire, except the worst in whom there was no virtue at all\. Eventually he showed them their goal and carried them to their places \(of deliverance\)\. Consequently their affairs moved on and their hand\-mill began to rotate \(i\.e\. a status gained strength\), their spears got straightened\.

By Allah, I was among their rear\-guard till they turned back on their sides and were flocked in their rope\. I never showed weakness or

<a id="page501"></a>lack of courage, nor did I betray or become languid\. By Allah,I shall split the wrong till I extract right from its flanks\.

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: I have quoted a selected part of this sermon before, but since I have found in the narration that this part differs from the previous one, more or less, I deemed it necessary to quote it again here\.

**Sermon 104**

**In Praise of the Holy Prophet \(h\) :**

Then Allah deputed Muhammad \(h\) as a witness, giver of good

tidings and warner, the best in the universe as a child and the most chaste as a grown man, the purest of the purified in conduct and the most generous of those who are approached for generosity\.

**About the Ummayads:**

This world did not appear sweet to you in its pleasures and you did not secure milk from its udders except after having met it when its nose rein was trailing and its leather girth was loose\. For certain peoples its unlawful items were like bent branches \(laden with fruit\) while its unlawful items were far away, not available\. By Allah, you will find liken a long shade until a fixed time\. So the earth is with you without let or hindrance and your hands in it are extended while the hands of the leaders are held away from you\. Your swords are hanging over them while their swords are held away from you\.

Beware that for every blood \(that is shed\) there is an avenger and for every right there is a claimant\. The avenger for our blood is like the judge for his own claim and it is Allah Who is such that if one seeks Him, then He does not disappoint him and one who runs away from Him, cannot escape Him\. I swear by Allah, O BanÅ Umayyah\! Soon you will see it \(i\.e\. your possession, that is, power\) in the hands of others and in the house of your enemy\. Be informed that the best looking eye is that whose sight catches virtue and know that the best hearing ear is that which hears good advice and accepts it\.

<a id="page502"></a>**About the Functions of the Imams:**

O people\! secure light from the flame of lamps of the preacher who follows what he preaches and draw water from the spring which has been cleaned of dirt\.

O servants of Allah, do not rely on your ignorance\. Do not be obedient to your desires because he who stays at this place is like one who stays on the brink of a bank undermined by water carrying ruin on his back from one portion to the other and following his opinion which he changes \(one after the other\)\. He wants to adhere what cannot adhere and to bring together what cannot keep together\. So fear Allah and do not place your complaints before him who cannot redress your grievance, nor undo with his opinion what has been made obligatory for you\.

Certainly, there is no obligation on the Imam except what has been devolved on him from Allah, namely to convey warnings, to exert in good advice, to revive the Sunnah, to enforce penalties on those liable to them and to issue shares to the deserving\. So hasten toward knowledge before its vegetation dries up and before you turn yourselves away from seeking knowledge from those who have it\. Desist others from the unlawful and abstain from it yourself because you have been commanded to abstain \(yourself\) before abstaining \(others\)\.

**Sermon 105**

**About Islam :**

Praise be to Allah Who established Islam and made it easy for those who approach it and gave strength to its columns against any one who tries to overpower it\. So Allah made it \(a source of\) peace for whoever clings to it, safety for whoever enters it, argument for whoever speaks about it, witness for whoever fights with its help, light for whoever seeks light from it, understanding for whoever provides it, sagacity for whoever exerts, a sign \(of guidance\) for whoever perceives, sight for whoever resolves, lesson for whoever seeks advice, salvation for whoever testifies, confidence for whoever trusts, pleasure for whoever entrusts and a shield for whoever endures\.

It is the brightest of all paths and the clearest of all passages\. It has dignified minarets, bright highways, burning lamps, prestigious fields of activity and high objectives\. It has a collection of race horses\. It is

<a id="page503"></a>approached eagerly\. Its riders are honorable\. A testimony \(to Allah, Prophet \(h\), etc\.\) is its way, good deeds are its minarets, death is in

extremity, this world is its race \-course\. The Day of Judgement is its horses and Paradise is its point of approach\.

**Part of the same sermon About the Holy Prophet \(h\):**

The Prophet \(h\) lit flames for the seeker and put bright signs for

the impeded\. So he is Your trustworthy trustee, Your witness on the Day of Judgement, Your deputy as a blessing and Your messenger of truth as mercy\. May Allah distribute to him a share from Your Justice and award him multiples of good by Your bounty\. May Allah heighten his construction over the construction of others, honor him when he comes to You, dignify his status before You, give him honorable status and award him glory and distinction and bring us out \(on Day of Judgement\) among his party, neither ashamed, nor repentant, nor deviators, nor pledge\-breakers, nor strayers, nor misleading others, nor seduced\.

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “This sermon had already appeared earlier but we have repeated it here because of the difference between the two versions\.

**Part of the same sermon addressing his followers:**

By the bounty of Allah over you, you have acquired a status where even your slave maids are honored, your neighbors are treated well\. Even he over whom you enjoy no distinction or obligation honors you\. Even those people fear you who had no apprehension of attack from you or any authority over you\. You now see pledges of Allah being broken but do not feel enraged although you fret and frown on the breaking of traditions of your forefathers\. Allah’s matters have been coming back to you; but you have given your place to wrongdoers and thrown your responsibilities toward them\. You have placed Allah’s affairs in their hands\. They act in doubts and tread in \(fulfillment of\) desires\. By Allah, even if they disperse you under every star Allah will surely collect you on the day that will be worst for them\.

**Sermon 106**

**Delivered During One of the Fighting Days of the Battle of**

**Siffn:**

<a id="page504"></a>I have seen your flight and your dispersal from the lines\. You were surrounded by rude and low people and bedouins of Syria, although you are the chiefs of Arabs and the summit of distinction and you possess dignity as that of the high nose and the big hump of a camel\. The sigh of my bosom can subside only when I eventually see you surrounding them as they surrounded you and see you dislodging them from their status as they dislodged you, killing them with arrows and striking them with spears so that their forward rows might fall on the rear ones just like the thirsty camels who have been turned away from their place of drink and removed from their water\-points\.

**Sermon 107**

**One of the Sermons about the Vicissitudes of Time :**

Praise be to Allah Who is Manifest before His creation because of themselves\. Who is apparent to their hearts because of clear proof; Who created without meditating, since meditating does not befit except one who has thinking organs while He has no thinking organ in Himself\. His knowledge has split forth the inside of unknown secrets and covered the bottom of deep beliefs\.

**Part of the same sermon about the Holy Prophet \(h\):**

Allah chose him from the lineal tree of prophets, from the flame of light, from the forehead of greatness, from the best part of the valley of al\-Bat’ha’, from the lamps for darkness and from the sources of wisdom\.

**Part of the same sermon**:

The Prophet \(h\) was like a roaming physician who has readied

his ointments and heated his instruments\. He uses them wherever the need arises for curing blind hearts, deaf ears and dumb tongues\. He followed with his medicines the spots of negligence and places of perplexity\.

**Remonstrating with the Muslims:**

They \(people\) did not take light from the lights of his wisdom nor did they produce flame from the flint of sparkling knowledge\. So in this matter they are like grazing cattle and hard stones\. Nevertheless hidden things have appeared for those who perceive\. The face of right has

<a id="page505"></a>become clear for the wanderer, the approaching moment has raised the veil from its face and signs have appeared for those who search for them\.

What is the matter with me\! I see that you are just bodies without spirits and spirits without bodies, devotees without good, traders without profits, wakeful but sleeping, present but unseen, seeing but blind, hearing but deaf and speaking but dumb\.

I notice that misguidance has stood on its center and spread \(all around\) through its off\-shoots\. It weighs you with its weights and confuses you with its measures\. Its leader is an out\-cast from the community\. He persists on misguidance\. So on that day none from among you will remain except as the sediment in a cooking pot or the dust left after dusting a bundle\. It will scrape you as leather is scraped and trample you as harvest is trampled and pick out the believer as a bird picks out a big grain from the thin grain\.

Where are these ways taking you, gloom misleading you and falsehoods deceiving you? Whence are you brought and where are you driven? For every period there is a written document and everyone who is absent has to return\. So listen to your godly leader and keep your hearts present\. If he speaks to you be wakeful\. The forerunner must speak truth to his people, should keep his wits together and maintain presence of mind\. He has clarified to you the matter as the stitch hole is cleared and scraped it as the gum is scraped \(from the twigs\)\.

Nevertheless, now the wrong has set itself on its places and ignorance has ridden on its riding beasts\. Unruliness has increased while the call for virtue is suppressed\. Wrong has pounced in time like a devouring carnivore and shouts like a camel after remaining silent\. People have become brothers over ill\-doings, have forsaken the essential unity of the religion but have instead, united in speaking lies and bear mutual hatreds in the matter of truth\.

When such is the case, the son will be a source of anger \(instead of coolness of the eye to parents\) and rain the cause of heat, the wicked will abound and the virtuous will diminish\. The people of this time will be wolves, its rulers beasts, the middle class men gluttons and the poor \(almost\) dead\. Truth will go down, falsehood will overflow, affection will be claimed with tongues but people will be quarrelsome at heart\. Adultery will be the key to lineage while chastity will be rare and Islam will be worn unturned like \(dead\) skin\.

<a id="page506"></a>

**Sermon 108**

**About the Might of Allah :**

Everything submits to Him and everything exists by Him\. He is the satisfaction of the poor, the dignity of the low, the energy for the weak and shelter for the oppressed\. Whoever speaks, He hears his speaking and whoever keeps quiet, He knows his secret\. On Him is the livelihood of everyone who lives and whoever dies returns to Him\.

\(O Allah\!\) The eyes have not seen You, so as to be aware of You, but You were before the describers of Your creation\. You did not create the creation on account of loneliness, nor did You make them work for gain\. He whom You catches cannot go farther than You and he whom You holds cannot escape You\. He who disobeys You does not decrease Your authority and he who obeys You does not add to Your Might\. He who disagrees with Your judgement cannot turn it and he who turns away from Your command cannot do without You\. Every secret before You is open and for You every absent is present\.

You are everlasting, there is no end to You\. You are the highest aim, there is no escape from You, You are the promised \(point of return\) from which there is no deliverance except towards You\. In Your hand is the forelock of every creature and to You is the return of every living being\. Glory to You\! How great is Your creation that we see, but how small is this greatness by the side of Your Might\. How awe\-striking is Your realm that we notice, but how humble is this against what is hidden from us out of Your authority\. How extensive are Your bounties in this world, but how small are they against the bounties of the next world\.

**Part of the Same Sermon about the Angels:**

You \(O Allah\) made angels reside in Your skies and placed them high above from Your earth\. They have the most knowledge about You and Your whole creation, the most fearing from You and the nearest to You\. They never stayed in loins nor were retained in wombs\. They were not created Afrom mean water \(semen\) \(Holy Quran, 32: 8; 77: 20\)\. They were not dispersed by vicissitudes of time\. They are on their places \(distinct\) from You and in their positions near You\. Their desires are concentrated in You\. Their worship for You is much\. Their neglect from Your command is little\. If they witness what remains hidden about You they will regard their deeds as very little, they will criticize themselves

<a id="page507"></a>and will realize that they did not worship You according to Your right for being worshipped and did not obey You as You has the right for being obeyed\.

**About the Bounties and Guidance of Allah and Those Who Are Ungrateful:**

Glorified are You, O Creator, the One worshipped by all, on account of Your good trials of Your creatures\. You created a house \(the Paradise\) and provided in it for feasting, drinks, foods, spouses, servants, places, streams, plantations and fruits\. Then You sent a messenger to invite towards it\. But the people did not respond to the caller and did not feel persuaded to what You persuaded them nor showed eagerness towards what You desired them to eagerly feel\. They jumped on the carcass \(of this world\), earned shame by eating it and became united in loving it\.

When one loves a thing it blinds him and sickens his heart\. Then he sees but with a diseased eye, hears but with unhearing ears\. Desires have cut asunder his wit and the world has made his heart dead, while his mind is all longing for it\. Consequently, he is a slave of it and of everyone who has any share in it\. Wherever it turns, he turns towards it and wherever it proceeds, he proceeds towards it\. He is not desisted by any disaster from Allah, nor takes admonition from any preacher\. He sees those who have been caught in neglect whence there is neither rescission nor reversion \(repentance\)\.

**About Death:**

Whatever they were ignoring has befallen them, separation from this world, from which they took themselves safe, has come to them and they have reached that in the Hereafter which they had been promised\. Whatever has befallen them cannot be described\. Pangs of death and grief for losing \(this world\) have surrounded them\. Consequently their limbs become languid and their complexion changes\. Then death increases its struggle over them\.

In some it stands in between him and his power of speaking although he lies among his people, looking with eyes, hearing with his ears, with full wits and intelligence\. He then thinks over how he wasted his life and in what \(activities\) he passed his time\. He recalls the wealth he collected when he had blinded himself in seeking it and acquired it from fair and foul sources\. Now the consequences of collecting it have

<a id="page508"></a>overtaken him\. He gets ready to leave it\. It will remain for those who are behind him\. They will enjoy it and benefit by it\.

It will be an easy acquisition for others but a burden on his back and the man cannot get rid of it\. He will thereupon, bite his hands with his teeth out of shame for what was disclosed to him about his affairs at the time of his death\. He will dislike what he coveted during the days of his life and he will wish that he who envied him on account of it and felt jealous over him for it should have amassed it instead of he himself\.

Death will go on affecting his body till his ears too will behave like his tongue \(and lose functioning\)\. So he will lie among his people, neither speaking with his tongue or hearing with his ears\. He will be rotating his glance over their faces, watching the movements of their tongues, but not hearing their speaking\. Then death will increase its sway over him and his sight will be taken by death as the ears had been taken and the spirit will depart from his body\. He will then become a carcass among his own people\. They will feel loneliness from him and get away from him\. He will not join a mourner or respond to a caller\. Then they will carry him to a small place in the ground and deliver him in it to \(face\) his deeds\. They will abandon visiting him\.

**About the Day of Judgement:**

Until whatever is written as ordained approaches its and the affairs complete their destined limits, the posteriors join the anteriors and whatever Allah wills takes place in the shape of resurrection of His creation\. Then He will convulse the sky and split it\. He will quake the earth and shake it\. He will root out the mountains and scatter them\. They will crush each other out of awe of His Glory and fear of His Dignity\.

He will take out everyone who is in it\. He will refresh them after they had been worn out and collect them after they had been separated\. Then He will set them apart for questioning about the hidden deeds and secret acts\. He will then divide them into two groups, rewarding one and punishing the other\. As regarding the obedient people He will reward them with His nearness and will keep them forever in His house from where those who settle the rein do not move out\. Their status will not undergo change, fear will not overtake them, ailments will not befall them, dangers will not affect them and journey will not force them \(from place to place\)\.

<a id="page509"></a>As for people of sins, He will settle them in the worst place, will bind their hands with the necks, bind the forelocks with feet and will clothe them in shirts of tar and dresses cut out of flames\. They will be in punishment whose heat will be severe, the door will be closed on the inmates \- in fire which is full of shouts and cries and rising flames and fearful voices\. Its inmate does not move out of it, its prisoner cannot be released by ransom and its shackles cannot be cut\. There is no fixed age for this house so that it might perish, nor period for its life that might pass away\.

**Part of the Same Sermon about the Holy Prophet \(h\):**

He treated this world disdainfully and regarded it low\. He held it contemptible and hated it\. He realized that Allah kept it away from him with intention and spread it out for others by way of contempt\. Therefore, he remained away from it by his heart, banished its recollection from his mind and wished that its attraction should remain hidden from his eye so that he should not acquire any clothing from it, or hope for staying in it\. He conveyed from Allah the pleas \(against committing sins\), counseled his people as a warner \(against the Divine chastisement\) and he called \(people\) towards Paradise as a conveyor of good tidings\.

**About the Descendants of the Holy Prophet \(h\):**

We are the tree of Prophethood, staying place of \(the Divine\) Message, descending place of angels, mines of knowledge and the sources of wisdom\. Our supporter and lover awaits mercy while our enemy and he who hates us awaits wrath\.

**Sermon 109**

**About Islam :**

The best means by which seekers of nearness to Allah, the Glorified One, the Exalted, seek nearness, is the belief in Him and His Prophet \(h\), fighting in His cause, for it is the high pinnacle of Islam and

\(to believe\) in kalimatul\-ikhlas \(the expression of the Divine purification\)\. It is a just nature and the establishment of prayer for it is \(the basis of\) community\. The payment of zakat for it is a compulsory obligation, fasting for the month of Ramadan for it is the shield against chastisement\. The performance of hajj to the House of Allah \(i\.e\. The Ka\`ba\) and its \`umrah \(other than annual visit\) for these two acts banish poverty and

<a id="page510"></a>wash away sins\. Regard for kinship for it increases wealth and length of life\. Giving alms secretly for it covers shortcomings, giving alms openly for it protects against a bad death and extending benefits \(to people\) for it saves from positions of disgrace\.

**About the Holy Quran and the Sunnah:**

Go ahead with the remembrance of Allah for it is the best remembrance and long for that which He has promised to the pious, for His promise is the most true promise\. Tread the course of the Prophet \(h\) for it is the most distinguished course\. Follow the Sunnah of the Prophet \(h\) for it is the most right of all behaviors\. Learn the Holy Quran for it is

the fairest of discourses and understand it thoroughly for it is the best blossoming of hearts\. Seek cure with its light for it is the cure for hearts\. Recite it beautifully for it is the most beautiful narration\. Certainly, a scholar who acts not according to his knowledge is like the off \-headed ignorant who does not find relief from his ignorance; but on the learned the plea of Allah is greater and grief more incumbent and he is more blameworthy before Allah\.

**Sermon 110**

**Cautioning about this World :**

So now, certainly I frighten you from this world for it is sweet and green, surrounded by lusts and liked for its immediate enjoyments\. It excites wonder with small things, is ornamented with \(false\) hopes and decorated with deception\. Its rejoicing does not last and its afflictions cannot be avoided\. It is deceitful, harmful, changing, perishable, exhaustible, liable to destruction, gnawing and destructive\. When it reaches the extremity of desires of those who incline towards it and feel happy with it, the status is just what Allah, the most Glorified One, says \(in the Holy Quran\):

\.\.\. like water which We send down from the heavens and the herbage of the earth mingles with it, then it becomes dry stubble which the winds scatter; for Allah over all things has power\. \(Holy Quran, 18: 45\)

Nobody rejoices about this world except that tears come to him after it, and no one enjoys its comforts except that he has to face hardships in thereafter\. No one receives the light rain of ease in it but the

<a id="page511"></a>heavy rain of distress pours upon him\. It is worthy of this world that in the morning it supports a man but in the evening it does not recognize him\. If one side of it is sweet and pleasant the other side is bitter and distressing\.

No one secures enjoyment from its freshness but he has to face hardship from its calamities\. No one will pass the evening under the wing of safety but that his morning will be under the feathers of the wing\-tip of fear\. It is deceitful and all that is the rein is deception\. It is perishable and all that is on it is to perish\. There is no good in its provisions except in piety\. Whoever takes little from it collects much of what will give him safety, while one who takes much from it takes much of what will ruin him\. He will shortly depart from his collection\. How many people relied on it but it distressed them; \(how many\) felt peaceful with it but it made them tumble; how many were prestigious but it made them low and how many were proud but it made them disgraceful\.

Its authority is changing\. Its life is dirty\. Its sweet water is bitter\. Its sweetness is like myrrh\. Its food are poisons\. Its means are weak\. The living in it are exposed to death; the healthy in it are exposed to disease\. Its realm is \(liable to be\) snatched away\. The strong in it are \(liable to be\) defeated and the rich are \(liable to be\) afflicted with misfortune\. The neighbor in it is \(liable to be\) plundered\.

Are you not \(residing\) in the houses of those before you, who were of longer ages, better traces, had bigger desires, were more in numbers and had greater armies? How they devoted themselves to the world and how they showed preference to it\! then they left it without any provision that could convey them through, or the back \(of a beast for riding\) to carry them\.

Did you get the news that the world was ever generous enough to present ransom for them, or gave them any support or afforded them good company? It rather inflicted them with troubles, made them languid with calamities, assaulted them with catastrophes, threw them down on their noses, trampled them under hoofs and helped the vicissitudes of time against them\. You have observed its strangeness towards those who went near it, acquired it and appropriated it, till they departed from it for good\. Did it give them any provision other than starvation, or make them stay in other than narrow places, or give them light other than gloom, or give them in the end anything other than repentance? Is this what you ask for so much or remain satisfied with, or towards which you feel greedy? How bad is this abode for him that he did not suspect it \(to be so\) and did not entertain fear from it?

<a id="page512"></a>You should know, as you do know, that you have to leave it and depart from it\. While in it, take lesson from those Awho proclaimed “who is more powerful than us?’ \(Holy Quran, 41: 15\), but they were carried to their graves, though not as riders\. They were then made to stay in the graves, but not as guests\. Graves were made for them from the surface of the ground\. Their shrouds were made from earth\. Old bones were made their neighbor\. They are neighbors who do not answer a caller nor ward off trouble, nor pay heed to a mourner\.

If they get rain they do not feel happy and if they face famine they do not get disappointed\. They are together but each one apart\. They are close together but do not see each other\. They are near but do not meet\. They are enduring and have no hatred\. They are ignorant and their malice has died away\. There is no fear of trouble from them and no hope of their warding off \(troubles\)\. They have exchanged the back \(surface\) of the earth with its stomach \(interior\), vastness with narrowness, family with loneliness and light with darkness\. They have come to it \(this world\) as they had left it with bare feet and naked bodies\. They departed from it with their acts towards the continuing life and everlasting house as Allah has said the following:

\.\.\. As we caused the first creation, so will We cause its return\. \(It is\) a promise binding Us, verily We were doing it\. \(Holy Quran, 21: 104\)

**Sermon 111**

**About the Angel of Death and the Soul Taking Leave :**

Do you feel when the Angel of Death enters a house, or do you see him when he calls the life out from someone? How does he take out the life of an embryo in the womb of his mother? Does he reach it through any part of her body or does the spirit respond to his call with the permission of Allah? Or does he stay with him in the mother’s inside? How can he who is unable to describe a creature like this, describe Allah?

**Sermon 112**

**About the World and its People :**

I warn you of the world for it is the abode of the unsteady\. It is not a house for foraging\. It has decorated itself with deception and deceives with its decoration\. It is a house which is low before Allah\. So

<a id="page513"></a>He has mixed its lawful with its unlawful, its good with its evil, its life with its death and its sweetness with its bitterness\. Allah has not kept it clear for His lovers, nor has He been niggardly with it towards His foes\. Its good is sparing\. Its evil is ready at hand\. Its collection will dwindle away\. Its authority will be snatched away\. Its habitation will face desolation\. What is the good of a house which falls down like fallen construction or what \(Existent\) good is there in an age which expires as the provision exhausts, or of time which passes like walking?

Include whatever Allah has made obligatory on you in your demands\. Ask from Him fulfillment of what He has asked you to do\. Make your ears hear the call of death before you are called by death\. Surely the hearts of the abstemious weep in this world even though they may\(apparently\) laugh and their grief increases even though they appear happy\. Their hatred for themselves is much even though they may be envied for the subsistence they are allowed\. Remembrance of death has disappeared from your hearts while false hopes are present in you\. So this world has mastered you more than the next world and the immediate end \(of this world\) has removed you away from the remote one \(of the next life\)\. You are brethren in the religion of Allah\. Dirty natures and bad conscience have caused separation \(disunity\) among you\. As a consequence you do not bear one another’s burdens, nor do you advise each other, nor spend on each other, nor do you love one another\.

What is your condition? You feel satisfied with what little you have secured from this world while much of the next world of which you have been deprived does not grieve you\. The little of this world which you lose pains you so much so that it becomes apparent in your faces and in the lack of your endurance over whatever is taken away from you; as though this world is your permanent abode and as though its wealth will stay with you for good\. Nothing prevents anyone among you to disclose to his comrade the shortcomings he is afraid of, except the fear that the comrade will also disclose to him similar defects\. You have been deceived together on leaving the next world and loving this world\. Your religion has become just licking with the tongue\. It is like the work of one who has finished his job and secured satisfaction of his master\.

**Sermon 113**

**About Abstemiousness, Fear of Allah and Importance of**

**Providing for the next Life :**

<a id="page514"></a>Praised be to the One Who follows praise with bounty and bounty with gratefulness\. We praise Him for His bounties as for His trails\. We seek His help against these hearts which are slow to obey what they have been commended but quick towards what they have been desisted from\. We seek His forgiveness from that which His knowledge covers and His document preserves knowledge which does not leave anything and document which does not omit anything\. We believe in Him like the belief of one who has seen the unknown and has attained the promised rewards \- belief, the purity whereof keeps off from belief in partners of Allah and whose conviction removes doubt\.

We testify that there is no god but Allah, the One, Who has no partner for Him and that Muhammad \(h\) is His slave and His Prophet \(h\), Allah may bless him and his descendants\. These two testimonials

intensify the utterance and raise the act\. The scale wherein they will be placed will not be light while the scale from which they are removed will not become heavy\.

**Enjoining People to Piety:**

O servants of Allah\! I admonish you to fear Allah which is the provision \(for next world\) and with it is \(your\) return\. The provision will take you \(to your destination\) and the return will be successful\. The best one, who is able to make people listen has called toward it and the best listener has listened to it\. So the caller has proclaimed and the listener has listened and preserved\.

O creations of Allah\! Certainly fear of Allah has saved the lovers of Allah from unlawful items and gave His dread to their hearts till their nights are passed in wakefulness and their days in thirst\. So they achieve comfort through trouble and copious watering through thirst\. They regarded death to be near and, therefore, hastened towards \(good\) actions\. They rejected their desires and so they kept death in their sight\.

Then, this world is a place of destruction, tribulations, changes and lessons\. As for destruction, the time has its bow pressed \(to readiness\) and its dart does not go amiss, its wound does not heal; it afflicts the living with death, the healthy with ailment and the safe with distress\. It is an eater who is not satisfied and a drinker whose thirst is never quenched\. As for tribulation, a man collects what he does not eat and builds wherein he does not live\. Then he goes out to Allah without carrying the wealth or shifting the building\.

<a id="page515"></a>As for its changes, you see a pitiable man becoming enviable and an enviable man becoming pitiable\. This is so because the wealth has gone and misfortune has come to him\. As for its lessons, a man reaches near \(realization of\) his desires when \(suddenly\) the approach of his death cuts them; then neither the desire is achieved nor the one who desires is spared\. Glory to Allah, how deceitful are its pleasures, how thirst\-rousing its quenching and how sunny its shade\. That which approaches \(i\.e\. death\) cannot be sent back, he who goes away does not return\. Glory to Allah, how near is the living to the dead because he will meet him soon and how far is the dead from the living because he has gone away from him\.

Certainly nothing is viler than evil except its punishment and nothing is better than good except its reward\. In this world everything that is heard is better than what is seen, while of everything of the next world that is seen is better than what is heard\. So you should satisfy yourself by hearing rather than seeing and by thenews of the unknown\. You should know that what is little in this world but much in the next is better than what is much in this world but little in the next\. In how many cases little is profitable while much causes loss\.

Certainly that which you have been commanded to do is wider than what you have been refrained from and what has been made lawful for you is more than what has been prohibited\. Then give up what is less for what is much and what is limited for what is vast\. Allah has guaranteed your livelihood and has commanded you to act\. Therefore, the pursuit of that which has been guaranteed to you should not get preference over that whose performance has been enjoined upon you\.

But by Allah, most certainly the status is that doubt has overtaken and certainty has been shattered and it seems as if what has been guaranteed to you is obligatory on you and what was made obligatory on you has been taken away from you\. So, hasten towards \(good\) actions and dread the suddenness of death because the return of age cannot be hoped for tomorrow, as the return of livelihood can be hoped\. Whatever is missed from livelihood today may be hoped tomorrow with increase, but whatever is lost from the age yesterday, its return cannot be expected today\. Hope can be only for that which is to come, while about that which is passed there is only disappointment\. So Afear Allah as He ought to be feared and do not die until you are \(true\) Muslim \(Holy Quran, 3: 102\)\.

<a id="page516"></a>

**Sermon 114**

**Praying for Rain :**

O Lord\! Surely our mountains have dried up and our earth has become dusty\. Our cattle are thirsty and are bewildered in their enclosures\. They are moaning like the moaning of mothers for their \(dead\) sons\. They are tired of going to their meadows and longing for their watering places\. O Lord\! have mercy on the groan of the groaning and yearn of the yearning\. O Lord\! have mercy on their bewilderment and their passages and their groaning in their yards\.

Lord\! We have come out to You when the years of drought have crowded over us like \(a herd of\) thin camels and rain clouds have abandoned us\. You are the hope for the afflicted and succor for the seeker\. We call You when the people have lost hope, when cloud have been denied and cattle have died; do not seize us for our deeds and do not catch us for our sins\. Spread Your mercy over us through raining clouds, rain fed blossoming, amazing vegetation and heavy downpours with which all that was dead regains life and all that was lost returns\.

Lord\! Give rain from You which should be life\-giving, satisfying, thorough, widely scattered, pure, blissful, plentiful and invigorating\. Its vegetation should be exuberant and its branches full of fruits and its green leaves\. With it You invigorates the weak among Your creatures and brings back to life the dead among Your cities\.

Lord\! Give rain from You with which our highlands get covered with green herbage, streams get flowing, our slopes grow green, our fruits thrive, our cattle prosper, our far flung areas get watered and our dry areas get its benefit, with Your vast blessing and immeasurable grant on Your distressed universe and Your untamed beasts\. And pour upon us rain which is drenching, continuous and heavy; wherein one cycle of rain clashes with the other and one rain drop pushes another \(into a continuous chain\)\. Its lightning should not be deceptive, its cheek not rainless, its white clouds not scattered and rain not light, so that the famine\-stricken thrive with its abundant herbage and the drought stricken come to life with its bliss\. Certainly, You pours down rain after the people lose hopes and spreads Your mercy, since You are the Guardian, the praiseworthy\.

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “The wonderful expressions of

this sermon are: Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s words insahat jibaluna means

<a id="page517"></a>the mountains cracked on account of drought\. It is said that insaha thawbah when it is torn\. It is also said that insaha’n\-nabtu or saba or sawwaha when vegetation withers and dries up\.”

His words wa hamat dawabbuna means became thirsty, as huyam means thirst\.

His words hadabiru’s\-sinin are the plural of hidbar\. It means: The camel whom treading has thinned\. So Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) likened

with such or camel the year in which drought had occurred\. The Arab poet Dhu ar\-Rumma has said the following:

These thin camels remain in their places, facing hardships and move only when we take them to some dry area\.

Notice his words wa la qaza’in rababuha\. Here, al\-qaza means small pieces of cloud scattered all around\.

His words wa la shaffanin dhihabuha stand for wa la dhata shaffanin dhihabuha\. Ash\-shaffan means the cold wind and adh\-dhihab means light rain\. He omitted the world dhata from here because of the listener’s knowledge of it\.

**Sermon 115**

**About Troubles Which Will Arise and the Day of Judgement :**

Allah deputed him \(the Prophet \[h\]\) as a caller towards Truth and a witness over the creatures\. The Prophet \(h\) conveyed the messages

of Allah without being lazy and without any short\-coming and he fought His enemies in the cause of Allah without being languid and without pleading excuses\. He is the foremost of all who practice piety and the power of perception of all those who achieve guidance\.

**Part of the same Sermon, Complaining about His Men:**

If you know what I know of the unknown that is kept wrapped up from you certainly you will have gone out into the open weeping over your deeds and beating yourselves in grief\. You will have abandoned your properties without any guard for it or any substitute over it\. Everyone will then have cared for his own self without paying attention to anyone else\. But you have forgotten what was recalled to you and felt safe from what

<a id="page518"></a>you had been warned\. Consequently, your ideas went astray and your affairs were dispersed\.

I do wish that Allah may cause separation between you and me and give me those who have a better knowledge of what is right than you to be with me\. By Allah\! Such are people of blissful ideas, enduring wisdom and true speech\. They keep aloof from rebellion\. They trod forward on the path \(of Allah\) and ran on the high road\. Consequently, they achieved the everlasting next life and honors of ease\.

Beware\! By Allah\! A tall lad of a swinging gait from Banu Thaqif will be placed over you\. He will eat away your vegetation and melt your fat\. So, O Aba Wadhahah, is that all?

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “Al\-Wadhahah means al\-khunfusa \(dung\-beetle\)\. In this sentence, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has

referred to al\-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf ath\-Thaqafi who had an incident with al\-Khunfusa, which needs not be related here\.159

**Sermon 116**

**Rebuking Misers :**

You spend no wealth in the cause of the One Who gave it to you, nor do you risk your lives for the sake of the One Who created such lives\. You enjoy honor through Allah among His creatures, but you do not honor Allah among His creatures\. You should derive lessons from occupying the places of those who were before you and from the departure of your nearest brothers\.

**Sermon 117**

**In Praise Of His Faithful Companions :**

159The detail of this incident is that one day al\-Hajjaj stood up for saying prayers when al\-khunfusa advanced towards him\. Al\-Hajjaj held out his hand to stop him but he bit him whereby his hand got swollen and eventually he died of it\. Ibn Abul\-Hadad has written that al\-Wadhahah means the dung that remains sticking to the tail of an animal and this surname is intended to disgrace him\.

<a id="page519"></a>You are supporters of Truth and brethren in faith\. You are the shield on the day of tribulation and \(my\) trustees among the rest of the people\. With your support I strike the runner away and hope for the obedience of him who advances forward\. Therefore, extend to me support which is free from deceit and pure from doubt because, by Allah, I am the most preferable of all for the people\.

**Sermon 118**

**Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) collected the people and exhorted**

**them1 to jihad but they observed a long silence\. Then he said the following: “What is the matter with you\. Have you lost your wits?\! A group of them replied: “O Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\! If you go**

**forth we shall be with you, whereupon Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)**

**said the following:**

What has happened to you?\! You may not be guided aright or shown the right path\. Should I, under such circumstances, go forth?\! In fact, at this time one of the brave and the valorous among you whom I select should go out\. It does not suit me to leave the army, the city, the public treasury, the land revenue, the dispensation of justice among Muslims and looking after the demands of the claimants and to follow one contingent after the other moving here and there like featherless arrow moving in the quiver\.

I am the axis of the mill\. It rotates on me while I remain in my status\. As soon as I leave, the center of its rotation will be disturbed and its lower stone will also be disturbed\. By Allah, this is very bad advice\. By Allah\! If I had not been hoping for martyrdom by my meeting with the enemy, and my meeting with them has been ordained, I will have secured my carrier and went away from you and will not have sought you so long as the north and South differed\.

160When after the Battle of Siffin, Mu\`awiyah’s forces began to attack various places in Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s area, he asked the Iraqis to check them but they declined on the plea that they will follow him if he himself came forward\. Thereupon, he delivered this sermon and clarified his limitations, that if he himself went out it was impossible to run the affairs of the state and that the enemy’s attacks had already started on all sides\. In these circumstances it was against politics to keep the center unguarded\. But what could be hoped from those who changed the victory at Siffn into defeat and opened the door for these attacks\.

<a id="page520"></a>There is no benefit in the majority of your numbers because of a lack of unity of your hearts\. I have put you on the clear path whereon no one will perish except who perishes by himself\. He who sticks to it will achieve Paradise and he who deviates goes to Hell\.

**Sermon 119**

**About The Greatness Of Ahl Al\-Bayt \(x\) And The Importance Of The Laws Of Islam :**

By Allah\! I have knowledge of the conveyance of messages, fulfillment of promises and of entire expressions\. We the people of the house \(Ahl al\-Bayt \[x\]\) possess the doors of wisdom and light of

governance\. Beware that the paths of religion are one and its highways are straight\. He who follows them achieves \(the aim\) and secures \(the objective\)\. And he who stood away from it went astray and incurred repentance\.

Do act for the day for which provisions are stored and when the intentions will be tested\. If a person’s own intelligence which is present with him does not help him, the wits \(of others\) which are remote from him are more unhelpful and those which are away from him more useless\. Dread the fire whose flame is severe, whose hollow is deep, whose outfit is iron and whose drink is bloody puss\. Beware\! The good name of a man161 retained by Allah, the Sublime, among the people is better than wealth inherited by those who will not praise him\.

A Persian couplet says the following:

Happy is he who is remembered well after himself, For nothing, save the name, remains after the man is dead\.

161If a person gives away something in his life\-time then the recipient feels obliged to him\. But if wealth is extracted by force then the extractor does not feel himself under his obligation, nor does he praise it\. The same is the case of one who dies\. His successors think that whatever he had left behind was their right and they should have received it\. In this there is no obligation of his to be acknowledged\. But if he had done some good act with this very wealth his name will have remained behind him and people will have praised him also\.

**Sermon 120**

**A man from among the companions of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib stood up and said, “O Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\! You first**

**stopped us from the arbitration, then you gave order for it\. We do not know which of the two was more appropriate?”Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) struck one hand over the other and said the following :**

Such is the reward of one who breaks a pledge\. By Allah\! When I gave you my orders \(namely\) to abide by arbitration I had led you to an undesirable thing \(namely war\) in which Allah had ordained good\. If you had been steadfast I will have guided you, if you had been bent I will have straightened you and if you had refused I will have rectified you\. This was the surest way\. But with whom and through whom? I wanted my treatment from you but you proved to be my disease, like the one who extracts a thorn with another thorn when he knows that the thorn bends toward itself\.

Lord\! The physicians have despaired of this fatal ailment and water\-drawers have become tired with the rope of this well\. Where162 are those who were invited to Islam and they accepted it? they read the Holy Quran and decided according to it\. They were exhorted to fight and they

162Although all those who fought under the banner of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) were called Shi\`as of Ali, yet only those who had tears in their eyes,

paleness on their faces, the Quranic verses on their tongues, zeal of religion in their hearts, steadfastness in their feet, determination and courage in their spirits and patience and endurance in their minds could in true sense be called Shi\`as of Ali\. These were the people in whose separation Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s feelings were coming out in the shape of sighs through the breath, while the flames of the fire of separation were consuming his heart and spirit\. These were the people who leapt towards death like mad men and did not feel happy if they survived\. Rather, their heart’s slogan was as the Persian hemistich says the following: “We are ashamed why we have remained alive\.”He who has even a slight brilliance of these qualities can alone be called the follower of the Descendants of the Prophet \(h\) of the Shi\`a of Ali; otherwise, it will be a word which has lost its meaning and

been bereft of its dignity through misuse\. Thus tradition has it that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) saw a group of men at his door and inquired from Qanbar who they were and he answered they were his Shi\`as\. On hearing this Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had a frown on his forehead and said, “Why are they called Shi\`as? they have no sign of Shi\`as\. Thereupon, Qanbar inquired as to what were the signs of Shi\`as and Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) replied: “Their bellies are thin through hunger, their lips dry through thirst and their eyes bleared through weeping\.”

<a id="page522"></a>leapt \(toward it\) as she\-camels leap towards their young\. They took their swords out of the sheaths and went out into the world in groups and rows\. Some of them perished and some survived\. The good news of survival does not please them nor do they get condoled about the dead\. Their eyes have turned white with weeping\. Their bellies are emaciated because of fasting\. Their lips are dry because of \(constant\) praying\. Their color is pale because of wakefulness\. Their faces bear the dust of God\-fearing\. These are my comrades who have departed\. We should be justified if we feel eager for them and bite our hands in their separation\.

Certainly, Satan has made his ways easy for you and wants to unfasten the knots of religion one by one and to cause division among you in place of unity\. Keep away from his evil ideas and enchantments and accept good advice of one who offers it to you and preserve it in your minds\.

**Sermon 121**

**When the Kharijites Persisted in Their Rejecting the Arbitration, Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Went to Their Camp and Addressed Them Thus:**

Were all of you with us in Sifin? they replied that some of them were but some of them were not\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said the following:

Then you divide yourself into two groups\. One of those who were in Siffin and other of those who were not present the re, so that I may address each as I see suitable\.

**Then the Imam \(x\) shouted the following to the people:**

Stop talking and keep quiet to listen to what I say\. Turn your hearts to me\. Whomever we ask for testimony, he should give it according to his knowledge about it\.

**Then he conversed with them in length\. During the conversation, he said the following:**

When they raised the Holy Quran by way of deceit, craft, artifice and cheating, did you not say that they are our brothers and comrades in accepting Islam? They want us to cease fighting and ask for protection

<a id="page523"></a>through the Book of Allah, the Glorified\. Our opinion is to agree with them and to end their troubles\. Then I said to you, In this affair, the outer side is Faith but the inner side is enmity\. Its beginning is pity and the end is repentance\. Consequently you should stick to your status and remain steadfast on your path\. You should press your teeth \(to put all your might\) in jihad and should not pay heed to the shouts of one who shouts\.163 If he is answered, he will mislead, but if he is left \(answered\), he will be disgraced\.

But when this thing \(arbitration\) was done I found that you agreed to it\. By Allah, if I had refused it, it will not have been obligatory on me\. Nor will Allah have laid its sin on me\. And by Allah, not that I have accepted it, I alone am the rightful person who should be followed, for certainly the Holy Quran is with me\. I have never forsaken it since I adopted its company\. We have been with the Prophet \(h\) in battles

wherein those killed were fathers, sons, brothers and relations of one another\. Nevertheless, every trouble and hardship just increased us in our belief, in our treading on the right path, in submission to \(the Divine\) command and in endurance of the pain of wounds\.

We now had to fight our brethren in Islam because of entry into Islam of misguidance, crookedness, doubts and \(wrong\) interpretation\. However, if we find any way by which Allah may collect us together in our disorder and by which we may come near each other in whatever common remains between us we will accept it and will give up everything else\.

Ibn Abul\-Hadid writes that this sermon comprises three parts which do not fit together because Sayyid ar\-Radi selected some parts of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s sermons and did not record other parts as a result of which the continuity of utterance was not maintained\. Thus, one part ends at “If he is left unanswered, he will be disgraced”, the other at “And endurance at the pain of wound” and the third runs till the end of the sermon\.

**Sermon 122**

**Address of Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) to His Followers on**

**the Battlefield of Siffin About Providing a Moral Support For the**

**Weak and the Low\-spirited During the Fighting :**

163This is a reference to either Mu\`awiyah or Amr ibn al\-As\.

<a id="page524"></a>Whoever among you feels spiritedness of heart during the action and finds any of his comrades feeling disheartened should ward off \(the enemies\) from him just as he will do from himself because of the superiority he enjoys over the other, for if Allah had willed He will have made the former also like him\. Certainly death is a quick seeker\. Neither does the steadfast escape it nor can the one who runs away defy it\. The best death is to be killed\. By Allah in Whose hand \(power\) lies the life of the son of Abu Talib, certainly a thousand strikes of the sword on me are easier to me than a death in bed which is not in obedience to Allah\.

**Part of the same sermon:**

It is as if I see you uttering voices like the rustling sound of lizards\! You do not seek your own claims nor do you defend against oppression\. You have been let free on the path\. He who rushes \(into the battle\) achieves salvation, while he who lags behind, hesitating, gets destruction\.

**Sermon 123**

**Exhorting His Followers to Fight :**

Put the armored man forward and keep the unarmored one behind\. Grit your teeth because this will make the swords skip off the skull and dodge on the sides of the spears for it changes the direction of their blades\. Close the eyes because it strengthens the spirit and gives peace to the heart\. Kill the voices because this will keep off spiritlessness\.

Do not let your banner bend, nor leave it alone\. Do not give it to anyone except the brave and the defenders of honor among you because they alone endure the befalling of troubles; they surround the banners and encircle them on both sides, their rear and their front\. They do not separate from them lest they give them \(to the enemy\)\. They do not go ahead of them lest they leave them alone\. Everyone should deal with his adversary and also help his comrade by his own life and should not leave the adversary to his comrade lest both his own adversary and his comrade join against him\.

By Allah\! Even if you run away from the sword of today you will not remain safe from the sword of the next world\. You are the foremost among the Arabs and great figures\. Certainly in running away there is the wrath of Allah, unceasing disgrace and lasting shame\. And certainly run

<a id="page525"></a>who runs does not lengthen his life, nor does anything come to intervene between him and his day \(of death\)\. Who is there to go towards Allah like the thirsty going to the water? Paradise lies under the edges of spears\. Today the reputations \(about the valor of warriors\) will be tested\.

By Allah\! I am more eager to meet them \(in combat\) than they are for \(returning to\) their houses\. O Lord\! If they reject truth, disperse their group, divide their words \(opinion\) and destroy them on account of their sins\.

They will not budge from their stand till the continuous striking of spears causes piercing \(of wounds\) through which wind may pass\. And the hitting of swords cuts through the skull, cleaves bones and breaks forearms and legs, till they are attacked by contingent after contingent and assaulted by detachments which are followed by reserves for support, till their cities are continuously assailed by force after force and till the horses trample even the extreme ends of the lands, the tracks of their beast and their meadows\.

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “Add\-da’q means trampling, e\.g\. ataduqqul\-khuyulu bihawafiriha ardahum \(the horses trample the ground with their hoofs\)\. Anawahini ardihim means lands opposite each other\. It is said, amanazilu bani fulanin tatanaharu, meaning: The houses of so\-and\-so face each other\.

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) delivered this sermon on the occasion of the battle of Siffin\. This battle was fought in the year 37 A\.H\. between Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and the governor of Syria,

Mu\`awiyah, for the so\-called avenging for the killing of Caliph Othman\. But in reality it was nothing more than Mu\`awiyah who had been the autonomous governor of Syria from Caliph Omer’s days\. He, not wanting to lose that status by swearing allegiance to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

but wanting to keep his authority intact by exploiting the killing of Caliph Othman, for later events, proved, that after securing the government, he did not take any practical step to avenge Othman’s blood\. And he never spoke, not even through omission, about the killers of \`Othman\.

Although from the first day Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) realized

that was inevitable, it was still necessary to exhaust all pleas\., therefore, Monday the 12th Rajab, 36 A\.H\. he returned to Kufa after the Battle of Jamal\. He sent Jarir ibn Abdillah al\- Bajali with a letter to Mu\`awiyah at Damascus wherein he wrote that the Muhajirun and the Ansar had sworn

<a id="page526"></a>allegiance to him and that he too should first swear him allegiance and thereafter place the case of Othman’s killing before him so that he could pass verdict the reon according to the Holy Quran and Sunnah\. But Mu\`awiyah detained Jarir on several pretexts and after consulting Amr ibn al\-As, staged a rebellion on the excuse of Othman’s killing\. And with the help of important persons of Syria, he convinced the ignorant people that the liability for Othman’s life lay on Ali \(x\) and that he, with his

conduct, had encouraged the besiegers and had given them protection\. Meanwhile he hung the blood\-stained shirt of Othman and the amputated fingers of his wife Na’ila daughter of al\-Farafisah on the pulpit in the Central Mosque of Damascus around which seventy thousand Syrians cried and swore the pledge to avenge Othman’s blood\. When Mu\`awiyah had roused the feelings of the Syrians to such an extent that they were determined to lay down their lives and be killed, he secured their allegiance on the cause of avenging Othman’s blood and busied himself in equipping for the battle\. Thereafter, he showed all this to Jarr then sent him back mortified\.

When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) learned of these matters

through Jarir ibn Abdillah al \-Bajali, he was forced to rise against Mu\`awiyah, ordering Malik ibn Habib al\-Yarbu’i to mobilize their forces in the valley of An\-Nukhayla\. Consequently, people from the suburbs of Kufa began arriving there in large numbers, till they exceeded eighty thousand\. First of all, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) sent a vanguard

contingent, eight thousand strong, under Ziyad ibn an\-Nadr al\-Harithi and another of four thousand strong under Shurayh ibn Hani al \-Harithi towards Syria\. After the departure of this vanguard contingent he himself set out for Syria at the head of the remaining army on Wednesday the 5th of Shawwal\. When he was out of the boundary of Kufa he offered zuhr \(noon\) prayer and after staying at Dayr Abu Musa, Nahr \(river\) Nars, Quba’t Qubbin, Babil \(Babylon\), Dayr Ka\`b, Kerbala’, Sabat, Bahurasini, al\-Anbar and Jazira arrived at ar\-Riqqa\. The people of this place were in favor of Othman and at this very place Simak ibn Makhtamah al\-Asadi was putting up eight hundred men\. These people had left Kufa to join Mu\`awiyah after deserting Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\. When they had

seen Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s force, they had dismantled the bridge over the River Euphrates so that the Imam’s army should not cross over to the other side of the river\. But at the threatening of Malik ibn al\-Harith al\-Ashtar an\- Nakh\`i they were frightened\. After consultations among themselves they put the bridge together again and Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) passed over it with his army\. When he alighted on the other side

of the river he saw that Ziyad and Shurayh were also camped there along

<a id="page527"></a>with their men since both of them had adopted the land route\. When, on reaching here, they found that Mu\`awiyah was advancing with his armies towards the Euphrates and thinking that they will not be able to face him, they stopped there waiting for Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\. When they

had given the reason for their stopping the re, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

accepted their plea and sent them forward\. When they reached surat ar\-Rum they found that Abul\-Awar al\-Salami was camping there with his army\. Both of them informed Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) of this,

whereupon he despatched Malik ibn al\-Harith al\-Ashtar an\-Nakhi in their wake as the Officer in Command, cautioning him not to initiate the fighting but to try to counsel them and appraise them of the correct status as far as possible\. In this way, on reaching there Malik al\-Ashtar encamped a little distance away\. Fighting could have commenced any moment, but he did not interfere with the other side nor did he take any step by which fighting could have been commenced\. But Abul\-A\`war suddenly attacked them at night, whereupon they took their swords out of the sheaths and prepared to repulse them\. Clashes between the two sides went on for sometime but in the end, taking benefit of the darkness of night Abul\-A\`war fled away\. Since fighting had already commenced, soon after the appearance of dawn an Iraqi commander, Hashim ibn \`Utbah al\-Mirqal az\-Zuhri, took his status in the battlefield\. From the other side also a contingent came to face him and the flames of fighting rose\. At last Malik al\-Ashtar challenged Abul\-Awar to fight him, but he did not dare to face him and towards the evening Malik al\-Ashtar went onward with his men\. The next day Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) reached

there with his force and set off for Siffin with the vanguard contingent and other forces\. Mu\`awiyah had already reached there and had set up his bases\. He had also placed a guard on the Euphrates and had occupied it\. On reaching there Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) sent him word to remove

the guard from Euphrates, but he refused, whereupon theiraqis took out their swords and in a courageous attack captured the Euphrates\. When this stage was over Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) sent Bashir ibn Amr al\-

Ansari, Sa’id ibn Qays al\-Hamdani and Shabath ibn Rab\`i at\- Tamimi to Mu\`awiyah to apprise him of the consequences of war and to make him agree to settlement and allegiance\. But his relay was that they could not by any means let Othman’s blood remain neglected and that now the sword alone will arbitrate between them\. Consequently in the month of Dhul \-Hijja 36 A\.H\. both the parties decided on war and warriors from each side came out into the field to face their adversary\. Those who entered the battlefield from Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s side were: Hijr ibn Adiy al\-Kindi, Shabath ibn Rab\`i at\-Tamimi, Khalid ibn al\-Mu’ammar,

<a id="page528"></a>Ziyad ibn an\-Nadr al\-Harithi, Ziyad ibn Khasafah at\-Taymi, Sa’id ibn Qays al\-Hamdani, Qays ibn Sa\`d al\-Ansari and Malik ibn al\-Harith al\-Ashtar an\-Nakh\`i while from the Syrians there were, \`Abd ar\- Rahman ibn Khalid ibn al\-Walid al\-Makhzumi, Abul\-Awar al\-Salami, Habib ibn Maslamah al\- Fihri, \`Abdullah ibn Dhi’l\-Kala’al\-Himyari, \`Ubaydullah ibn Umar ibn al\-Khattab, Shurahbil ibn Simt al\-Kindi and Hamzah ibn Malik al\-Hamdani\. When the month of Dhul\- Hijja came to end the fighting had to be stopped for Muharram, but from the 1st of Safar fighting was resumed and both parties arrayed themselves opposite each other, equipped with swords, spears and other weapons\. On Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s side Malik al\-Ashtar was in command of the horsemen and Ammar ibn Yasir of the foot soldiers of Kufa while Sahl ibn Hanayf al\-Ansari was in command of the horsemen and Qays ibn Sa\`d of the foot soldiers of Basra\. The banner of the army was given to Hashim ibn Utbah\. In the army of the Syrians on the right hand contingent ibn Dhi’l\-Kala’ was in command, while on the left hand contingent Habb ibn Maslamah, on horsemen Amr ibn al\-As and on foot soldiers ad\-Dahhak ibn Qays al\-Fihri were in command\.

On the first day Malik ibn al\-Ashtar entered the battlefield with his men and from the other side Habib ibn Maslamah came out with his men to face him and from both sides a fierce battle ensued\. Throughout the day swords clashed with swords and spears with spears\.

The next day, Hashim ibn Utbah came out with Ali’s army and from the other side Abul\-A\`war with his footmen came to face him\. When the two armies approached each other, horsemen fell upon horsemen and footmen upon footmen and continued attacking each other and they endured with great patience and steadfastness\.

On the third day, Ammar ibn Yasir and Ziyad ibn an\-Nadr came out with horsemen and foot soldiers and from the other side \`Amr ibn al\-As came forward with a big force\. Ziyad attacked the horsemen of the opposite side and Malik al\-Ashtar attacked the foot soldiers so furiously that the enemy’s men lost ground and, failing to offer resistance, returned to their camps\.

On the fourth day Muhammad ibn al\-Hanafiyya appeared on the battlefield with his men\. From the other side \`Ubaydullah ibn \`Umar came forward with the Syrian army and both the armies had a serious encounter\.

<a id="page529"></a>On the fifth day, Abdullah ibn Abbas came forward and from the other side al\-Walid ibn Uqba ibn Abu Mu’ayt came to face him\. Abdullah ibn Abbas carried the assaults with great steadfastness and courage, giving such a brave fight that the enemy left the field in retreat\.

On the sixth day, Qays ibn Sa\`d al\-Ansari came forward with the army and to face him Ibn Dhi’l\-Kala’ came out with his contingent\. A fierce fighting ensued; at every step, bodies were seen falling and blood flowing like streams\. At last, the darkness of the night separated the two armies\.

On the seventh day, Malik al\-Ashtar came out and to face him, Habib ibn Maslamah came forward with his men and fighting raged till zuhr \(noon\)\.

On the eighth day, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) himself came out

with the army and made such an assault that the entire battlefield quaked and piercing through the ranks and warding off shots of arrows and spears he came and stood between both the lines\. Then he challenged Mu\`awiyah, whereupon the latter, along with Amr ibn al\-As, came a bit closer\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said to him: \`Amr\! Come out and face me\. Let whoever kills the other be the ruler, whereupon \`Amr ibn al\-As said to Mu\`awiyah, “Ali \(x\) is right\. Gather a little courage and face him\.”

Mu\`awiyah replied, “I am not prepared to waste my life at your taunting\.”Having said this much, he went back\. When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) saw him retreating he smiled and himself too returned\. The

daring with which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) led the attacks in Siffin

can only be called a miraculous feat\. Thus, whenever he came out challenging in the battlefield, the enemy lines were dispersed into utter disarray and confusion and even courageous combatants hesitated to appear against him\. That is why on a few occasions he came onto the battlefield in changed outfit so that the enemy should not recognize him and someone should be prepared to engage with him personally\. Once Arar ibn Adham came from the other side to engage with al \-Abbas ibn Rabi\`ah al\-Harith ibn Abdul\- Muttalib\. They remained engaged but neither could defeat the other, until al\-Abbas chanced to see that a link of his adversary’s amour was loose\. With a swift stroke he entangled the point of his sword in it then with a quick jerk he cut through a few more links\. Then with true aim he gave such a blow that his sword went straight into his bosom\. Seeing this, people raised the call of takbir\. Mu\`awiyah was startled at this noise and on coming to know that Arar ibn Adham had been slain he was much disturbed and shouted if there was anyone to take

<a id="page530"></a>revenge for Arar ibn Adham and kill al\-Abbas\. Al\-Abbas came to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) to seek permission\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

detained him, put on al\-Abbas outfit and riding on al\-Abbas’s horse entered the battlefield\. Taking him to be al\-Abbas, the Lakhams said the following: “So you have got your chief’s permission\. In reply Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) recited the following verse:

Permission \(to fight is\) given unto those upon whom war is made for they have been oppressed and verily, to help them, Allah is Most Potent\. \(Holy Quran, 22: 39\)

A man came out from the other side shouting like an elephant, ran amok and assaulted Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), but the Imam avoided

the blow then gave such a clean cut with his sword to the other’s back that he was split into two\. People thought the blow had gone without avail, but when his horse jumped his two separate parts fell on the ground\. After him another man came out but he too was finished in the twinkling of an eye\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) challenged others but from the strokes of his sword the enemy came to know that it was Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) in the outfit of al\-Abbas and so none dared come to face him\.

On the ninth day, the right wing was under the command of Abdullah ibn Budayi and the left wing under that of Abdullah ibn Abbas\. In the center was Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) himself\. On the other side,

Habib ibn Maslamah commanded the Syrian army\. When both the lines had come face\-to\-face with each other, the valiant soldiers drew out their swords and pounced upon one another like ferocious lions and fighting raged on all sides\. The banner of the right wing of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s army was revolving in the hands of Banu Hamdan\. Whenever anyone of them fell, martyred, someone else will pick up the banner\. First of all Kurayb ibn Shurayh raised the banner, on his fall Shurahbil ibn Shurayh took it up, then Marthad ibn Shurayh, then Hubayrah ibn Shurayh then Yarim ibn Shurayh, then Sumayr ibn Shurayh and after the killing of all these six brothers the banner was taken up by Sufyan, then Abd, then Kurayb, the three sons of Zayd, who all fell martyred\. After that the banner was lifted by two brothers \(sons\) of Bashir namely \`Umayr and al \-Harithi and when they too fell martyred, Wahab ibn Kurayb took up the banner\. On this day the enemy’s greater attention was on the right wing and its assaults were so fierce that the men lost ground and began to retreat from the battlefield\. Only three hundred men remained with the Officer in Command Abdullah ibn Budayl\. On seeing

<a id="page531"></a>this Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) asked Malik al\-Ashtar to call them back

and challenge them as to where they were fleeing\. If the days of life are over they cannot avoid death by running away\. Now the defeat of the right wing could not be without effect on the left wing, so Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) turned to the left wing and advanced forward, forcing

through the enemy lines, whereupon a slave of Banu Umayyah named Ahmar said to him, “Allah may cause me to die if I fail to slay you today\!”On hearing this, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s slave Kaysan leapt over him but was killed by him\. When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) saw this, he caught him by the skirt of his amour and, picking him up, threw him down so forcefully that all his joints were smashed, whereupon Imam Hassan \(x\) and Muhammad ibn al\-Hanafiyya came forward and

dispatched him to Hell\. Meanwhile, after having been called to Malik al\-Ashtar and his having made them feel ashamed, those who retreated came back and again assaulted so steadfastly that pushing back the enemy they reached the place where Abdullah ibn Budayl was surrounded by the enemy\. When he saw his own men he picked up courage and leapt towards Mu\`awiyah’s tent with drawn sword\. Malik al\-Ashtar tried to stop him but he could not and, killing seven Syrians, he reached the tent of Mu\`awiyah\. When Mu\`awiyah noticed him close by he ordered him to be stoned, as a result of which he was overpowered and the Syrians crowded over him and killed him\. When Malik al\-Ashtar saw this he proceeded forward with the combatants of Banu Hamdan and Banu Madhhaj for an attack on Mu\`awiyah and began dispersing the contingent on guard around him\. When, out of the five circles of his guards only one remained to be dispersed, Mu\`awiyah put his foot in the stirrup of his horse in order to run away, but on someone’s encouragement again stopped\. On another side of the battlefield a tumult was raging from one end to the other by the swords of Ammar ibn Yasir and Hashim ibn Utbah\. From whatever side Ammar passed, the companions \(of the Holy Prophet \[h\]\) flocked around him then made such a joint assault that

destruction spread throughout the enemy lines\. When Mu\`awiyah saw them advancing he threw his fresh forces towards them\. But he continued displaying the excellence of his bravery under the storm of swords and spears\. At last Abul \-Adiyah al\-Juhani hit him with a spear from which he could not balance himself then Ibn Hawiy \(Jawn as\-Saksiki\) came forward and slew him\. Ammar ibn Yasir’s death caused tumult in Mu\`awiyah’s ranks because about him they had heard the Holy Prophet \(h\) having said the following: “Ammar will be killed at the hands of a

rebellious party\. Thus before he fell as martyr Dhul\-Kala’ had said to \`Amr ibn al\-As, “I see Ammar on Ali’s side; are we that rebellious

<a id="page532"></a>party?” Amr ibn al\- As had assured him that eventually Ammar would join them, but when he was killed fighting on Ali’s side, the rebellious party stood exposed and no room was left for any other interpretation\. Nevertheless Mu\`awiyah started telling the Syrians: “We did not kill Ammar, but Ali did it because he brought him to the battlefield\.”When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) heard this cunning sentence, he remarked, “In

that case, the Holy Prophet \(h\) killed \(his uncle the valiant\) Hamzah

because he had brought him to the battlefield of Uhud\.” Hashim ibn Utbah also fell in this conflict\. He was killed by al\-Harith ibn Mundhir at\-Tanukhi\. After him the banner of the contingent was taken over by his son Abdullah\.

When such fearless warriors were gone, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said to the warriors from the tribes of Hamdan and Rabi\`ah, “To me,

you are like amour and spear\. Get up and teach these rebels a lesson\.”Consequently, twelve thousand combatants from the tribes of Rabi\`ah and Hamdan stood up, swords in hand\. The banner was taken up by Hudyan ibn al\-Mundhir\. Entering the lines of the enemy, they used their swords in such a way that heads began to drop, bodies fell in huge heaps and on every side streams of blood flowed\. And the assaults of those swordsmen knew no stopping till the day began to end with all its devastation\. And the gloom of eve set in, ushering in that fearful night which is known in history as the night of al\-Harir, wherein the clashing of weapons, the hoofs of horses and the hue and cry of the Syrians created such notice that even voices reaching the ears could not be heard\. On Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s side, his wrong\- crushing slogans raised waves of courage and valor and on the enemy’s side they shook the hearts in their bosoms\. The battle was at its zenith\. The quivers of the bowmen had become empty\. The stalks of the spears had been broken\. Hand to hand fighting went on with swords only and dead bodies collected in heaps, till by morning the number of killed had exceeded thirty thousand\.

On the tenth day, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s men showed the same high morale\. On the right wing, Malik al\-Ashtar held the command and on the left wing Abdullah ibn Abbas\. Assaults went on like the assaults of new soldiers\. Signs of defeat appeared on the Syrians and they were about to leave the battlefield and run away, when five hundred Holy Qurans were raised on spears changing the entire face of the battle\. Moving swords stopped, the weapon of deceit was successful and the way was clear for wrong to hold its sway\.

<a id="page533"></a>In this battle forty\-five thousand Syrians were killed while twenty\-five thousand Iraqis fell as martyrs as we read in Kitab Siffin by Nasr ibn Muzahim al\-Minqari \[d\. 212 A\.H\.\] and Tarikh al\-Tabari, Vol\. 1, pp\. 3256\-3349\)\.

**About the Kharijites and Their Opinion on Arbitration:**

We did not name people arbitrators, but we named the Holy Quran the Arbitrator\. The Holy Quran is a book covered between two flaps and it does not speak\. It should, therefore, necessarily have an interpreter\. Men alone can be such interpreters\. When these people invited us to name the Holy Quran as the arbitrator between us, we could not be the party turning away from the Book of Allah, since Allah has said the following:

If you quarrel about anything refer it to Allah

and the Prophet \(h\)\. \(Holy Quran, 4: 59\)

Reference to Allah means that we decide according to the Holy Quran while reference to the Prophet \(h\) means that we follow his

Sunnah\. Now therefore, if arbitration were truly done through the Book of Allah \(Holy Quran\), we will be the most rightful of all people for the Caliphate; or if it were done by the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet \(h\), we will be the most preferable of them\.

Concerning your point why I allowed a time lag between myself and them with regard to the Arbitration, I did so in order that the ignorant may find out \(the truth\) and one who already knows may hold with it firmly\. Possibly Allah may, as a result of this peace, improve the condition of these people and they will not be caught by the throats and will not, before indication of the right, fall into rebellion as before\. Certainly the best man before Allah is he who loves most to act according to right, even though it causes him hardship and grief, rather than according to wrong, even though it gives him benefit and increase\.

So, where are you being mislead and from where have you been brought \(to this state\)? Be prepared to march to the people who have deviated from the right and do not see it, have been entangled in wrong\-doing and are not corrected\. They are away from the Book and turned from the \(right\) path\. You are not trustworthy to rely upon, nor are you holders of honor to be adhered to\. You are very bad in kindling the fire of

<a id="page534"></a>fighting\. Woe to you\! I had to bear a lot of worries from you\. Some days I call to you \(to jihad\) and some days, I speak to you in confidence\. You are neither true free men at the time of call, nor trustworthy brothers at the time of speaking in confidence\.

**Sermon 125**

**When Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Was Spoken Ill of for**

**Showing Equality in the Distribution \(Of Shares from Bayt al\-Mal or the Muslim Public Treasury\) He Said the Following :**

Do you command me that I should seek support by oppressing those over whom I have been placed? By Allah, I will not do so as long as the world goes on and as long as one star leads another in the sky\. Even if it were my property, I will have distributed it equally among them, then why not when the property is that of Allah\. Beware; certainly that giving of wealth without any right for it is wastefulness and lavishness\. It raises its doer in this world, but lowers him in the next world\. It honors him before people, but disgraces him with Allah\. If a man gives his property to those who have no right for it or do not deserve it, Allah deprives him of their gratefulness and their love too will be for others\. Then if he falls on bad days and needs their help, they will prove the worst comrades and ignoble friends\.

**Sermon 126**

**About the Kharijites :**

If you do not stop believing that I have gone wrong and have been misled, why do you consider that the common men among the followers of the Prophet Muhammad \(h\) have gone astray like me and

accuse them with my wrong and hold them unbelievers on account of my sins\. You are holding your swords on your shoulders and using them right and wrong\. You are confusing those who have committed sins with those who have not\. You know that the Prophet \(h\) stoned the protected

\(married\) adulterers, then he also said his burial prayer and allowed his successors to inherit from him\. He amputated \(the hand of\) the thief and whipped the unprotected \(unmarried\) adulterer, but thereafter allowed their shares from the booty and they married Muslim women\. Thus the Prophet \(h\) took them to ask for their sins and also abided by Allah’s

<a id="page535"></a>commands about them, but did not disallow them their rights created by Islam, nor did he remove their names from its followers\.

Certainly you are the most evil of all persons and are those whom Satan has put on his lines and thrown out into his wayless land\. With regard to me, two categories of people will be ruined, namely he who loves me too much and the hatred which takes him away from rightfulness\. The best man with regard to me is he who is on the middle course\. So be with him and be with the great majority \(of Muslims\) because Allah’s hand \(of protection\) is on keeping unity\. You should beware of division because the one isolated from the group is \(a prey\) to Satan just as the one isolated from the flock of sheep is \(a prey\) to the wolf\.

Beware\! Whoever calls to this course, kill him, even though he may be under this headband of mine\. Certainly the two arbitrators were appointed to revive what the Holy Quran revives and to destroy what the Holy Quran destroys\. Revival means to unite on it \(in a matter\) and destruction means to divide on a matter\. If the Holy Quran drives us to them we should follow them and if it drives them to us they should follow up\. May you have no father\! \(Woe to you\), I did not cause you any misfortune, nor have I deceived you in any matter, nor created any confusion\. Your own group had unanimously suggested in favor of these two men and we bound them that they will not exceed the Holy Quran but they deviated from it and abandoned the right although both of them were conversant with it\. This wrong\-doing was the dictate of their hearts\. So they trod upon it, although we had stipulated that in arbitrating with justice and sticking to rightfulness they will avoid the evil of their own views and the mischief of their own verdict \(but since this has happened the award is not acceptable to us\)\.

**About Important Events in Basra :**\.

O Ahnaf\! It is as though I see him advancing with an army which has neither dust nor noise, nor rustling of reins, nor neighing of horses\. They are trampling the ground with their feet as if they are the feet of ostriches\.

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) pointed to the Chief of the Blacks \(Sahibuz\-Zanj\)\.”

<a id="page536"></a>Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said, “Woe unto you \(O people of

Basra’s\) inhabited streets and decorated houses which possess wings like the wings of vultures and trunks like the trunks of elephants\. They are the people from among whom if one is killed he is not mourned and if one is lost he is not searched for\. I turn this world over on its face, value it only according to its \(low\) value and look at it with an eye suitable to it\.”

**Part of the same sermon:**

**Referring to the Turks \(Mongols\), he said,**

I can see a people whose faces are like shields covered with roughly\-scraped skins\. They outfit themselves in silken and woolen clothe s and hold dear excellent horses\. Their killing and bloodshed shall take place freely till the wounded shall walk over the dead and the number of runners\-away shall be less than those taken prisoner\.

One of his companions said to him, “O Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib\! You have been given knowledge of hidden things,” whereupon Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) smiled and said to the man who belonged to the tribe of

Banu Kalb, “O brother of Kalb\! This is not knowledge of hidden things \(ilmul\-ghayb\)\! These matters have been acquired from him \(namely in Prophet \(h\)\) who knew them\. As regard knowledge of hidden things,

that means knowledge of the Day of Judgement and the things covered by Allah in the verse;

Verily, Allah is He with Whom is the knowledge of the Hour\. \(Holy Quran, 31: 34\)

Therefore, Allah, and only Allah, knows what is there in the wombs, whether male or female, ugly or handsome, if he/she will be generous or miserly, mischievous or pious, a fuel for Hell or in the company of the Prophet \(h\) in Paradise\. This is the knowledge of the hidden things which is not known to anyone save Allah\. All else is that whose knowledge Allah passed on to His Prophet \(h\) and he passed it on

to me and prayed for me that my bosom may retain it and my ribs may hold it\.

Ali ibn Muhammad was born in the village of Warzanin in the suburbs of Ray and belonged to the Azariqah sect of the Kharijites\. He claimed to be a Sayyid \(descendant of the Holy Prophet \(h\)\) by showing

<a id="page537"></a>himself the son of Muhammad ibn Ahmed al\-Mukhtafi ibn Isa ibn Zayd ibn Ali ibn al\-Hussain ibn Ali ibn Abu Talib, but the experts on genealogy, as well as biographers, have all rejected his claim to being a Sayyid and have given his father’s name as Muhammad ibn Abd ar\-Rahim instead of Muhammad ibn Ahmed\. The former was from the tribe of Abdul\-Qays and had been born of a Sindi maid\-slave\.

Ali ibn Muhammad \(h\) rose as an insurgent in 255 A\.H\. in the

reign of al \-Muhtadi Billah and associated with him the people from the suburbs of Basra on promise of money, wealth and freedom\. He entered Basra on the 17th Shawwal, 255 A\.H\. killing and looting and in only two days he put to death thirty thousand individuals, men, women and children and displayed extreme opposition, bloodshed, savageness and ferocity\. He dismantled houses, burnt mosques and after continuous killing and devastation for fourteen years, was killed in the month of Safar, 270 A\.H\. in the reign of Muwaffaq Billah\. Then people got rid of his devastating deeds\.

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s prediction is one of those predictions which throw light on his knowledge of the unknown\. The details of his army given by Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) namely that there will be

neither the neighing of horses nor the rustling of weapons the rein is a historical fact\. The historian al\-Tabari has written that when this man reached near al\-Karkh \(a sector of Baghdad\) with the intention of instruction, the people of that place welcomed him and a man presented him a horse for which no rein could be found despite a search\. At last he rode it using a rope for the rein\. Similarly there were at that time only three swords in his force\-one with himself, one with Ali ibn Aban al\-Muhallabi and one with Muhammad ibn Salm but later they collected some more weapons by marauding\.

The prediction of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) stated above is

about the attack of the Tartars \(Mongols\) who were inhabitants of the Mongolian desert in the north west of Turkey\. These semi\- savage tribes lived by marauding, killing and devastating\. They used to fight among themselves and attack neighboring areas\. Each tribe had a separate chief who was deemed responsible for their protection\. Chingiz \[Jenkiz\] Khan \(Temujin\) who was one of the ruling chiefs of these tribes and was very brave and courageous had risen to organize all their divided tribes into one and, despite their opposition he succeeded in overpowering them through his might and sagacity\. Collecting a large number under his

<a id="page538"></a>banner he rose in 606 A\.H\. like a torrent and went on dominating cities and ruining populations till he conquered the area up to North China\.

When his authority was established he offered his terms of settlement to Ala’ud\- Din Khwarazm Shah, ruler of the neighboring country of Turkey and through a deputation concluded an agreement with him that Tartar traders will be allowed to visit his country for trade and their life and property will not be subject to any harm\. For some time they traded freely without fear but on one occasion Ala’ud\-Din accused them of spying, seized their goods and had them killed by the Chief of Atrar\. When Chingiz Khan learned of the breach of the agreement and the killing of Tartar merchants his eyes cast forth flames and he began trembling with rage\. He sent word to Ala’ud\- Din to return the goods of the Tartar merchants and to hand over to him the ruler of Atrar\. Ala’ud\-Din, who was mad with power and authority, did not pay any heed and acting short\-sightedly killed even the plenipotentiary of Jenkiz Khan\. Now Chinzing Khan lost all patience and his eyes filled with blood\. He rose with his sword in hand and the Tartar warriors leapt towards Bukhara on their speedy stallions\. Ala’ud \-Din came out with four hundred thousand combatants to face him but could not resist the incessant assaults of the Tartars and having been vanquished only after a few attacks ran away to Nishabur across the river Jaxartes \(Sihun\) \. The Tartars smashed Bukhara and razed it to the ground\. They pulled down schools and mosques, burning the houses to ashes and killing men and women without distinction\. The next year they assaulted Samarqand and devastated it completely\. After the fight of Ala’ud\-Din, his son Jalalu’d\-Din Khwarazm Shah had assumed the reins of government\. The Tartars chased him also and for ten years he fled from one place to the other but did not fall in their hands\. At last he crossed over the river out of the boundaries of his realm\. During this time the Tartars did their utmost to ruin populated lands and to annihilate humanity\. No city escaped their ruining and no populace could avoid their trampling\. Wherever they went they upset the kingdom, overthrown governments and in a short time established their authority over the northern region of Asia\.

When Chingiz Khan died in 622 A\.H\. his own son Ogedei Khan succeeded him\. He searched out Jalalu’d\-Din in 628 A\.H\. And killed him\. After him Mongka Khan, the son of the other son of Chingiz Khan, occupied the throne\. After Mongka Khan, Qubilai Khan succeeded to a part of the country and the control of Asia fell to the share of his brother Hulagu Khan\. On the division of the whole realm among the grandsons of Chingiz Khan, Hulagu Khan was thinking of conquering Muslims area when the Hanafite of Khurasan in enmity with the Shafi’ite invited him to

<a id="page539"></a>attack Khurasan\. He, therefore, led an assault on Khurasan and the Hanafite, thinking themselves to be safe from the Tartars, opened the city gates for them\. But the Tartars did not make any distinction between Hanafite and Shafi’ite and killed whoever fell to their hands\. After killing most of its population they took it in occupation\. These very differences between the Hanafite and the Shafi’ite opened for him the door of conquest up to Iraq\. Consequently, after conquering Khurasan his courage increased and in 656 A\.H\. he marched on Baghdad with two hundred thousand Tartars, al \-Musta’sim Billah’s army and the people of Baghdad jointly faced them, but it was not in their power to stop this torrent of calamity\. The result was that the Tartars entered Baghdad on the day of Ashura’ carrying with them bloodshed and ruin\. They remained busy in killing for forty days\. Rivers of blood flowed in the streets and all the alleys were filled with dead bodies\. Hundred of thousands of people were put to the sword while al\-Musta’sim Billah was trampled to death under foot\. Only those people who hid themselves in wells or underground places and hid from their sight could survive\. This was the devastation of Baghdad which shook of Abbasid Kingdom to its foundation, so that its flag could never fly thereafter\.

Some historians have laid the blame of this ruin on ibn al\-Alqami \(Abu Talib, Muhammad ibn Ahmed al\-Baghdadi\), the minister of al\-Musta’sim Billah, by holding that, moved by the general masses of the Shi’as and the ruin of al\-Karkh sector \(of Baghdad\), he invited Hulagu Khan through the latter’s minister, the great scholar Nasir’d\-Din Muhammad ibn Muhammad at\-Tusi, to march on Baghdad\. Even if it be so, it is not possible to ignore the historical fact that before this the Abbasid Caliph an\-Nasir Lidini’llah had initiated the move for the attack on the Muslim areas\. When the Khwarazm Shahs declined to acknowledge the authority of the Caliphate he had sent word to Chingiz Khan to march on Khwarazm, from which the Tartars had understood that there was no unity and cooperation among the Muslims\. Thereafter the Hanafite had sent for Hulagu Khan to crush the Shafi’ite as a consequence of which the Tartars secured control over Khurasan and prepared the way to march towards Baghdad\. In these circumstances to hold only ibn al\-Alqami responsible for the ruination of Baghdad and to ignore the move of an\-Nasir Lidinillah and the dispute between the Hanafite and the Shafi’ite will be covering up the facts, when in fact the cause for the ruin of Baghdad was this very conquest of Khurasan, whose real movers were the Hanafite inhabitants of the place\. It was by this conquest that Hulagu Khan had the courage to march on the center of Islam\.; otherwise, it cannot have been the result of a single individual’s message that he

<a id="page540"></a>assaulted an old capital like Baghdad, the awe of whose power and grandeur was seated in the hearts of a large part of the world\.

To know hidden things on a personal level is one thing, while to be gifted by Allah with knowledge of any matter and to convey it to others is different\. The knowledge of the future which the prophets and vicegerents possess is gained by them through Allah’s teaching and informing\. Allah alone has knowledge of events which are to happen in the future\. Of course, He passes this knowledge on to whoever He wills\. Thus He says the following:

\(He alone is\) the One Who knows the unseen, neither does He reveal His secrets to any \(one else\) **save** to that one of the Messengers whom He chooses\. \(Holy Quran, 72: 26\-27\)

In this way, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) also received knowledge of the future through the instructions of the Prophet \(h\) or inspiration from Allah, for which these words of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) stand

testimony\. Of course, sometimes it is not proper or expedient to disclose certain matters and they are allowed to remain under a veil\. Then no one can be acquainted with them as Allah says,

Verily, Allah is He with Whom is the knowledge of the Hour and He sends down the rain and knows what is in the wombs, and no soul knows what it shall earn in the morrow, nor does any soul know in what land it shall die: Verily Allah is All\-knowing, All\-aware\. \(Holy Quran, 31: 34\)

**Sermon 128**

**About Measures and Weights, the Transience of this World and the Condition of its People :**\.

O servants of Allah\! You and whatever you desire from this world are like guests with fixed period of stay and like debtors called upon to pay\. Life is getting short while \(the records of\) actions are being preserved\. Many strivers are wasting \(their efforts\) and many of those who exert are heading towards harm\. You are in a period when steps of virtue are moving backwards, steps of evil are moving forward and Satan is increasing his eagerness to ruin people\. This is the time that his equipment is strong, his traps have been spread and his prey has become easy \(to catch\)\.

<a id="page541"></a>Cast your glance over people wherever you like, you will see either a poor man suffering from poverty, or a rich man ignoring Allah despite His bounty over him, or a miser increasing his wealth by trampling on Allah’s obligations, or an unruly person closing his ears to all counsel\. Where are your good people; where are your virtuous people? Where are your high\- spirited men and generous men? Where are those of you who avoid deceit in their business and remain pure in their behavior? Have they not all departed from this ignoble, transitory and troublesome world? Have you not been left among people who are just like rubbish and so low that lips avoid mention of them and do not move even to condemn their low status\.

Verily we are Allah’s, and verily unto Him shall we return\.

\(Holy Quran, 2: 156\)

Mischief has appeared and there is no one to oppose and change it, nor anyone to dissuade from it or desist from it\. Do you, with these qualities, hope to secure abode in the purified neighborhood of Allah and to be regarded His staunch lovers? Alas\! Allah cannot be deceived about His paradise and His will cannot be secured save by His obedience\. Allah may curse those who advise good but they themselves avoid it and those who desist others from evil but they themselves act upon it\.

**Sermon 129**

**Delivered When Abu Dharr \(l\\\) Was Exiled to Rabadha:**

O Abu Dharr\! You demonstrated your anger in the Name of Allah; therefore, have hope in Him for Whom you became angry\. The people were afraid of you in the matter of their \(seeking the pleasure of this\) world while you feared them for your faith\. Then leave to them that for which they are afraid of you and get away from them taking away what you fear them about\. How needy are they for what you dissuade them from and how heedless are you towards what they are denying you\. You will shortly know who is the gainer tomorrow \(on the Day of Judgement\) and who is more enviable\. Even if these skies and earth were closed to some individual and he feared Allah, then Allah will open them for him\. Only rightfulness should attract you while wrongfulness should detract you\. If you had accepted their worldly attractions they will have loved you and if you had shared in it they will have given you asylum\.

<a id="page542"></a>Abu Dharr al\-Ghifari’s name was Jundab ibn Junadah\. He was an inhabitant of ar\-Rabadha which was a small village on the east side of Medna\. When he heard about the proclamation of the Prophet \(h\), he

came to Mecca and after making inquiries saw the Prophet \(h\) and

accepted Islam whereupon the unbelievers of Quraish gave him all sorts of troubles and inflicted pain after pain, but he remained steadfast\. Among the acceptors of Islam he is the third, fourth or fifth\. Along with this precedence in Islam his renunciation and piety was so high that the Prophet \(h\) said, “Among my people, Abu Dharr is the like \`¦sa \(Jesus\)

son of Maryam \(Mary\) in renunciation and piety\.”

During the reign of \`Umar, Abu Dharr left for Syria, and during Othman’s reign, he also remained there\. He spent his days in counseling, preaching, acquainting people with the greatness of the members of the Prophet’s family and guiding the people to the rightful path\. The traces of Shi\`ism now found in Syria and Jabal Amil \(northern Lebanon\) are the result of his preaching and activity and the fruit of seeds sown by him\. The Governor of Syria, Mu\`awiyah, did not like the conduct of Abu Dharr and was much disgusted with his open criticism and mention of the money\-making and other wrongful activities of Othman\. But he could do nothing\. At last he wrote to Othman that if he remained there any longer he will rouse the people against the Caliph\. They should, therefore, be some remedy against this\. On this, Othman wrote to him that Abu Dharr should be seated on an unsaddled camel and dispatched to Medina\. The order was obeyed and Abu Dharr was sent to Medina\. On reaching Medina he resumed his preaching of righteousness and truth\. He will recall to the people the days of the Holy Prophet \(h\) and refrain them

from displays of extravagance, whereupon Othman was much perturbed and tried to restrict his freedom of speech\. One day, he sent for him and said, “I have come to know that you go about propagating that the Holy Prophet \(h\) said, “When Banu Umayyah become thirty in number, they

will regard the cities of Allah as their own property, His creatures as their slaves and His religion as the tool of their treachery\.”

Abu Dharr replied that he had heard the Prophet \(h\) say so\.

Othman said that he was speaking a lie\. Othman inquired from those beside him if any one of them had heard this tradition\. They all replied in the negative\.\.\.\! Abu Dharr then said that the same enquiry should be made from Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\. Ali \(x\) was sent for and asked about it\.

Ali \(x\) said that it was correct and that Abu Dharr was telling the truth\. Othman inquired on what basis he gave testimony for the correctness of

<a id="page543"></a>this tradition\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) replied that he himself had heard the Holy Prophet \(h\) say, “There is no speaker under the sky or over the earth more truthful than Abu Dharr\.”

Now Othman could do nothing\. If he still held him to be liar it will mean falsification of the Prophet \(h\)\. He, therefore, kept quiet

despite much perturbation, since he could not refute him\. On the other side Abu Dharr began speaking against the usurping of Muslims’ property quite openly and whenever he saw Othman he will recite this verse:

nd those who hoard up gold and silver and spend it not in Allah’s way; announce you unto them a painful chastisement\. On the Day \(of Judgement\) when it shall be heated in the fire of hell, then shall be branded with it their foreheads and their sides and their backs; \(saying unto them\) AThis is what you hoarded up for yourselves, taste you then what you did hoard u, p\. \(Holy Quran, 9: 34\-35\)

Othman promised him money but could not entrap this free man in his golden net, then resorted to repression but could not stop his truth\-speaking tongue\. At last he ordered him to leave and go to ar\-Rabadha and deputed Marwan, son of the man \(al\-Hakam\) exiled by the Prophet \(h\), to turn him out of Medina\. At the same time he issued the inhumane

order that no one should speak to him nor see him off\. But Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), Imam Hassan, Imam Hussain \(x\), Aqil ibn Abu Talib,

Abdullah ibn Ja\`far and Ammar ibn Yasir did not pay any heed to this order and accompanied him to see him off and Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) uttered these sentences \(i\.e\. the above sermon\) on that occasion\.

In Rabadha, Abu Dharr had to put up with a very hard life\. It was here that his son, Dharr, and his wife died and the sheep and goats that he was keeping for his livelihood also died\. Of his children, only one daughter remained who equally shared his starvation and woes\. When the means of subsistence were fully exhausted and day after day passed without food she said to Abu Dharr, “Father\! How long shall we go on like this? We should go somewhere in search of livelihood\.”Abu Dharr took her with him and set off for the wilderness\. He could not find even foliage to sustain themselves\. At last, he was tired; he sat down somewhere\. Then he collected some sand and, putting his head on it, lay down\. Soon he began gasping, his eyes rolled up and the pangs of death gripped him\.

<a id="page544"></a>When the daughter saw this condition, she was perplexed and said, “Father\! If you die in this vast wilderness, how shall I manage for your burial all by myself?”He replied, “Do not get upset\. The Prophet \(h\) told me that I shall die in helplessness and some Iraqis will arrange

for my burial\. After my death, you must put a sheet over me then sit by the roadway\. When some caravan passes by, tell them that the Prophet’s companion Abu Dharr has died\.”Consequently, after her father’s death, she went and sat by the roadside\. After some time, a caravan did, indeed, pass by\. It included Malik ibn al\-Harith al\-Ashtar an\-Nakh\`i, Hijr ibn Abdi at\-Ta’i, Alqamah ibn Qays an\-Nakh\`i, Sa\`sa\`ah ibn Suhhan al\-Abdi, al\-Aswad ibn Yazid an\-Nakh\`i etc\. who were all fourteen persons in number\. When they heard about the passing away of Abu Dharr they were shocked at his helpless death\. They stopped their riding beasts and postponed the onward journey for his burial\. Malik al\-Ashtar gave a sheet of cloth for his shroud\. It was valued at four thousand Dirhams\. After his funeral rites and burial they departed\. This happened in the month of Dhul\-Hijja, 32 A\.H\.

How hard it is for me to uncover for you the secrets of justice, or to straighten the curve of truthfulness\.

O Lord\! You knows that what we did was not to seek power nor to acquire anything from the vanities of the world\. We rather wanted to restore the signs of Your religion and to usher prosperity into Your cities so that the oppressed among thy creatures might be safe and Your forsaken commands might be established\. O Lord\! I am the first who leaned \(towards You\) and who heard and responded \(to the call of Islam\)\. No one preceded me in prayer \(salat\) except the Prophet \(h\)\.

You certainly know that he who is in charge of honor, life, booty \(enforcement of\), legal commandments and the leadership of the Muslims should not be a miser as his greed will aim at their wealth\. Nor should he be ignorant as he will then mislead them with his ignorance, nor be of rude behavior who will estrange them with his rudeness\. Nor should he

<a id="page545"></a>deal unjustly with wealth thus preferring one group over another, nor should he accept a bribe while taking decisions, as he will forfeit \(othe rs\) rights and hold them up without finality, nor should he ignore Sunnah as he will ruin the people\.

**Sermon 131**

**Warning About Death**

We praise Him for whatever He takes or gives or whatever He inflicts on us or tries us with\. He is aware of all that is hidden and He sees all that is concealed\. He knows all that breasts contain or eyes hide\. We render testimony that there is no god except He and that Muhammad \(h\)

- peace be upon him and his progeny \- has been chosen by Him and deputed by Him \- testimony tendered both secretly and openly, by heart and by tongue\.

**Part of the same sermon:**

By Allah\! Certainly it is reality not fun, truth not falsehood\. It is none else than death\. Its caller is making himself heard and its dragsman is making haste\. The majority of the people should not deceive you\. You have seen those who lived before you, amassed wealth, feared poverty and felt safe from its \(evil\) consequences, the longevity of desires and the \(apparent\) distance from death\. How, then, death overtook them, turned them out of their homelands and took them out of their places of safety\. They were borne on coffins, people were busy about them one after another, carrying them on their shoulders and supporting them with their hands\.

Did you not witness those who engaged in long \-reaching desires, built strong buildings, amassed much wealth but their houses turned to graves and their collections turned into ruin\. Their property devolved on the successors and their spouses on those who came after them\. They cannot \(now\) add to their good deeds nor invoke \(Allah’s\) mercy with regard to evil acts\. Therefore, whoever makes his heart habituated to fear Allah achieves a forward status and his action is successful\. Prepare yourself for it and do all that you can for Paradise\. Certainly this world has not been made a place of permanent stay for you\. But it has been created as a pathway in order that you may take from it the provisions of your \(good\) actions for the permanent house \(in Paradise\)\. Be ready for departure from here and keep close your riding animals for setting off\.

**Sermon 132**

**On the Glory of Allah**

This world and the next have submitted to Him their reins and the skies and earth have flung their keys towards Him\. The thriving trees bow to Him in the morning and evening and produce for Him \- flaming fire from their branches and at His command, turn their own feed into ripe fruits\.

**Part of the Same Sermon Bout the Holy Quran**

The Book of Allah is among you\. It speaks and its tongue does not falter\. It is a house whose pillars do not fall down and a power whose supporters are never routed\.

**Part of the Same Sermon about the Holy Prophet \(h\)**

Allah deputed the Prophet \(h\) after a gap from the previous prophets

when there was much talk \(among the people\)\. With him, “Allah exhausted the series of prophets and ended the revelation\. He then fought for Him those who were turning away from Him and were equating others with Him\.

**Part of the same sermon about this world**

Certainly this world is the end of the sight of the \(mentally\) blind who see nothing beyond it\. The sight of a looker \(who looks with the eye of his mind\) pierces through and realizes that the \(real\) house is beyond this world\. The looker, therefore, wants to get out of it while the blind wants to get into it\. The looker collects provision from it \(for the next world\) while the blind collects provision for this very world\.

**Part of the same sermon: A caution**

You should know that a man gets satiated and wearied with everything except life because he does not find for himself any pleasure in death\. It is in the status of life for a dead heart, sight for the blind eye, hearing for the deaf ear, quenching for the thirsty and it contains complete sufficiency and safety\.

<a id="page547"></a>The Book of Allah is that though which you see, you speak and you hear\. Its one part speaks for the other part and one part testifies to the other\. It does not create differences about Allah nor does it mislead its own follower from \(the path of\) Allah\. You are joined together in hatred of each other and in the growing of herbage on your filth \(i\.e\. for covering inner dirt by good appearance outside\)\. You are sincere with one another in your love of desires and bear enmity against each other in earning wealth\. The evil spirit \(Satan\) has perplexed you and deceit has misled you\. I seek the help of Allah for myself and you\.

**Sermon 133**

**Delivered when Umar ibn al\-Khattab consulted Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) about himself, taking part in the march towards Rome \(Byzantine Empire\) \.**

Allah has taken upon Himself for the followers of this religion the strengthening of boundaries and hiding of the secret places\. Allah helped them when they were few and could not protect themselves\. He is living and will not die\. If you will yourself proceed towards the enemy and clash with them and fall into some trouble, there will be no place of refuge for the Muslims other than their remote cities, nor any place they will return to\. Therefore, you should send there an experienced man and send with him people of good performance who are well\-intentioned\. If Allah grants you victory, then this is what you want\. If it is otherwise, you will serve as a support for the people and a returning place for the Muslims\.

About Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), the strange status is adopted

that on the one hand, it is said that he was ignorant of practical politics and unacquainted with ways of administration from which it is intended that the rebellions created by the Umayyad’s lust for power should be shown to be the outcome of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s weak administration\. On the other hand, much is made of the various occasion when the then Caliphs consulted Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) in important

affairs of State in the matter of wars with unbelievers\. The aim in this is not to exhibit his correctness of thinking and judgement of deep sagacity but to show that there was unity and concord between him and the Caliphs so that attention should not be paid to the fact that in some matters they also differed and that mutual clashes had also occurred\. History shows that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) did have differences of

principles with the Caliphs and did not approve every step of theirs\. In the

<a id="page548"></a>sermon of ash\-Shaqshaqiyya he has expressed in loud words his difference of opinion and anger about each regime\. Nevertheless, this difference does not mean that correct guidance should be withheld in collective Islamic problems\. Again, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s character was so high that no one could imagine that he will ever evade giving counsel which concerned the common wealth, or will give such counsel which will damage public interests\. That is why, despite differences of principles, he was consulted\. This throws light on the greatness of his character and the correctness of his thinking and judgement\. Similarly, it is a prominent trait of the Holy Prophet’s character that despite rejecting his claim to Prophethood the unbelievers acknowledged him the best trustee and could never doubt his trustworthiness\. Rather, even during clashes of mutual opposition they entrusted to him their property without fear and never suspected that their property will be misappropriated\. Similarly, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) was held to occupy so high a status

of trust and confidence that friend and foe both trusted in the correctness of his counsel\. So, just as the Prophet’s conduct shows his height of trustworthiness and just as it cannot be inferred from it that there was mutual accord between him and the unbelievers because trust has its own place while the clash of Islam and unbelief has another, in the same way, despite having differences with the Caliphs, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

was regarded as the protector of national and community interests and as the guardian of Islam’s well\-being and prosperity\. Thus when national interests were involved he was consulted and he tendered his unbiased advice raising himself above personal ends and keeping in view the Prophet’s tradition to the effect that “He who is consulted is a trustee never allowed any dishonesty or duplicity or interfere\. When on the occasion of the battle of Palestine, the \`Umar consulted him about his taking part in it himself, then, irrespective of whether or not his opinion will accord with \`Omer’s feelings, he kept in view Islam’s prestige and existence and counseled him to stay in his place and to send to the battle\-front such a man who should be experienced and well \-versed in the are of fighting because the going of an inexperienced man will have damaged the established prestige of Islam and the awe in which the Muslims were held which had existed from the Prophet’s days will have vanished\. In fact, in the Omer’s going there Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) saw signs of

defeat and vanquishment\. He, therefore, found Islam’s interest to lie in detaining him and indicated his view in the words that:\.

If you have to retreat from the battlefield, it will not be your personal defeat only, but the Muslims will lose heart by it and leave the battlefield and disperse here and there because with the officer in

<a id="page549"></a>command leaving the field the army too will lose ground\. Furthermore, with the center being without the Caliph there will be no hope of any further assistance from behind which could sustain courage of the combatants\.

This is that counsel which is put forth as a proof of mutual accord, although this advice was tendered in view of Islam’s prestige and life which was dearer to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) than any other

interest\. No particular individual’s life was dear to him for which he might have advised against participation in the battle\.

**Sermon 134**

**There was some exchange of words between Othman ibn Affan and Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) when al\-Mughirah ibn al\-Akhnas1 said to Othman that he will deal with Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) on his behalf whereupon Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said to al\-Mughirah:**

O son of the accursed and issueless and of a tree which has neither root nor branch\. Will you deal with me? By Allah, Allah will not grant victory to him whom you support, nor will he be able to stand up whom you raise\. Get away from us\. Allah may keep you away from your purpose\. Then do whatever you like\. Allah may not have mercy on you if you have pity on me\.

**Sermon 135**

**About the Sincerity of His Own Intention and Support of the Oppressed**

164Al\-Mughirah ibn al\-Akhnas ath\-Thaqafi was among the well\-wishers of Othman ibn Affan and the son of his paternal aunt\. His brother Abul\-Hakam ibn al\-Akhnas was killed at the hands of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) in the battle of

Uhud because of which he bore malice against Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\. His

father was one of those people who accepted Islam at the time of fall of Mecca but retained heresy and hypocrisy in his heart\. That is why Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) called him accursed and he called him issueless because he who has a son like al\-Mughirah deserves to be called “issueless”\.

<a id="page550"></a>Your allegiance to me was not without thinking,165 nor is my and your status the same\. I seek you for Allah’s sake but you seek me for your own benefits\. O people\! support me despite your heart’s desires\. By Allah, I will take revenge for the oppressed from the oppressor and will put a string in the nose of the oppressor and drag him to the spring of truthfulness even though he may grudge it\.

**Sermon 136**

**About Talhah and az\-Zubayr**

By Allah, they did not find any disagreeable thing in me, nor did they do justice between me and themselves\. Surely, they are now demanding a right which they have abandoned and blood which they have themselves shed\. If I partook in it with them then they too have a share in it, but if they committed it without me the demand should be against them\. The first step of their justice should be that they pass verdict against themselves\. I have my intelligence with me\.

I have never mixed matters nor have they appeared mixed to me\. Certainly, this is the rebellious group in which there is thenear one \(az\-Zubayr\), the scorpion’s venom \(Aisha\) and doubts which cast a veil \(on facts\)\. But the matter is clear and the wrong has been shaken from its foundation\. Its tongue has stopped uttering mischief\. By Allah, I will prepare for them a cistern from which I alone will draw water\. They will not be able to drink from it nor will they be able to drink from any other place\.

165Here Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) points to the view of Umar bin al\-

Khattab which he had on the allegiance of Abu Bakr on the day of _saqifa_ when he said the following: “Let me clarify this to you that the allegiance with Abu Bakr was a mistake and without thinking \(_falta_\) but Allah saved us from its evil\. Therefore, whoever \(intends to\) act like this you must kill him” \(_Sahih al\-Bukhari_, Vol\. 8, p\.211;_ As\-Sira an\-Nabawiyya_, Ibn Hisham, Vol\. 4, pp\. 308\-309;_ Tarikh al\-Tabari_, Vol\. 1, p\.1822;_ Al\-Kamil_, Ibn Al\-Athir Vol\. 2, p\.327;_ Tarikh ibn Kathir_, Vol\. 5, pp\.245\-246;* Al\-Musnad *of Imam Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Vol\. 1,

1. 255; _Al\-Sira al\-Halabiyya_, Vol\. 3, pp\. 388, 392; _Al\-Ansab_ by al\- Baladhiri, Vol\. 5, p\. 15; _Al\-Tamhid_ by al\-Baqillani, p\. 196; _Sharh ibn Abul\-Hadid_, Vol\. 2, p\. 23\)\.

<a id="page551"></a>**Part of the same sermon:**

You advanced towards me shouting allegiance, allegiance like she\-camels having delivered newly born young ones leaping towards their young\. I held back my hand but you pulled it towards you\. I drew back my hand but you dragged it\. O Lord\! These two have ignored my rights and did injustice to me\. They both have broken allegiance to me and roused people against me\. Unfasten You what they have fastened and do not make strong what they have woven\. Show them the evil in what they aimed at and acted upon\. Before fighting I asked them to be steadfast in allegiance and behaved with them with consideration but they belittled the blessing and refused \(to adopt the course of safety\)\.

**Sermon 137**

**Referring to Future Events**

He will direct desires towards \(the path of\) guidance while people will have turned guidance towards desires and he will turn their views to the direction of the Holy Quran while the people will have turned the Holy Quran to their views\.

**Part of the same sermon:**

Before this Enjoiner of Allah166, matters will deteriorate till war will rage among you with full force, showing forth its teeth, with udders full of sweet milk but with a sour tip\. Beware, it will be tomorrow and the morrow will come soon with things which you do not know\. The man in power, not from this crowd, will take to task all those were formerly appointed for their ill deeds and the earth will pour forth its internal treasures and fling before him easily her keys\. He will show you the just way of behavior and revive the Holy Quran and Sunnah which have become lifeless \(among people\)\.

166This prediction of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) is with regard to the appearance of the Twelfth Imam, Abul\-Qasim Muhammad ibn al\-Hassan, al\-Mahdi \(x\)\.

<a id="page552"></a>**Part of the same sermon:**

As if I see \(him\), he \(the Enjoiner of Evil\)167 is shouting in Syria and is extending his banners to the outskirts of Kufa\. He is bent towards it like the biting of the she\-camel\. He has covered the ground with heads\. His mouth is wide open and \(the trampling of\) his footsteps on the ground have become heavy\. His advance is broad and his attacks are severe\.

By Allah, he will disperse you throughout the earth till only a few of you remain, like kohl in the eye\. You will continue like this till the Arabs return to their sense\. You should, therefore, stick to established ways, clear signs and the early period which has the lasting virtues of the Prophethood\. You should know that Satan makes his ways easy so that you may follow him on his heels\.

**Sermon 138**

**On the Occasion of the Consultative Committee \(After the Death of Umar Ibn al\-Khattab\)**

No one preceded me in inviting people to truthfulness, in giving consideration to kinship and practicing generosity\. So, hear my word and preserve what I say\. Maybe you will see soon after today that over this matter swords will be drawn and pledges will be broken, so much so that some of you will become leaders of the people of misguidance and followers of people of ignorance\.

**Sermon 139**

**About Backbiting and Speaking Ill of Others’**

167This refers to Abdul\-Malik ibn Marwan who came to power in Syria after his father Marwan ibn al\-Hakam then after the killing of al\-Mukhtar ibn Abu Ubayd ath\-Thaqafi in his encounter with Mis’ab ibn az\-Zubayr he proceeded towards Iraq\. He clashed with Mis’ab’s force at Maskin near Dayrul\-Jathaliq \[Catholics’ Monastery\] in the outskirts of Kufa\. After defeating him he made a victorious entry into Kufa and took allegiance from its inhabitants\. Then he sent al\-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf ath\- Thaqafi to Mecca to fight with Abdullah ibn az\-Zubayr\. Consequently this man besieged Mecca and stoned it and shed the blood of thousands of innocent persons like water\. He killed ibn az\-Zubayr and hung his body on the gallows\. He perpetrated such atrocities on the people that one shudders at the thought of them\.

<a id="page553"></a>Those who do not commit sins and have been gifted with safety \(from sins\) should take pity on sinners and other disobedient people\. Gratitude should be mostly their indulgence and it should prevent them from \(finding faults with\) others\. What about the backbiter who blames his brother and finds fault with him? Does he not remember that Allah has concealed the sins which he committed while they were bigger than his brother’s sins pointed out by him? How can he vilify him about his sins when he has himself committed one like it? Even if he has not committed a similar sin he must have committed bigger ones\. By Allah, even if he did not commit big sins but committed only small sins, his exposing the sins of people is itself a big sin\.

O servants of Allah\! Do not be quick in exposition anyone’s sin for he may be forgiven for it and do not feel yourself safe even for a small sin because you may be punished for it\. Therefore, everyone of you who comes to know the faults of others should not expose them in view of what he knows about his own faults and he should remain busy in thanks that he has been saved from what others have been indulging in\.

The habit of fault finding and backbiting has become so common that even the feeling of its evilness has disappeared\. And at present neither the high avoid it nor the low; neither the high status of the pulpit prevents it nor the sacredness of the mosque\. Whenever a few companions sit together their topic of conversation and engaging interest is just to discuss the faults of their opponents with added color and to listen to them attentively\. Although the fault\-finder is himself involved in the faults which he picks up in others, yet he does not like that his own faults should be exposed\. In such a case, he should have consideration for similar feelings in others and should avoid searching for their faults and hurting their feelings\. He should act after the proverb: “Do not do unto others what you do not want others to do unto you\.

Backbiting is defined as the exposure of the fault of a brother\-in\-faith with the intent to vilify him in such a way as to irritate him, whether it be by speaking, acting, implication or suggestion\. Some people take backbiting to cover only that which is false or contrary to fact\. According to them to relate what was seen or heard, exactly as it was, is not backbiting and they say that they are not backbiting but only relating exactly what they saw or heard\. But in fact backbiting is the name of this very relating of the facts because if it is not factually correct it will be false accusation and wrong blame\. It is related about the Prophet \(h\) that

he said the following:\.

<a id="page554"></a>Do you know what backbiting is? People said, “Allah and His Prophet \(h\) know better\. Then he said, “Backbiting means that you say about your brother a thing which pains him\. Someone said, “But what if I say what is actually true about him? the Prophet \(h\) replied, “It is

backbiting only when it is factually true; otherwise, you will be accusing him falsely\.

There are many causes for indulging in backbiting and because of this a man commits it sometimes knowingly and sometimes unknowingly\. Abu Hamid al\-Ghazali has recounted these causes in detail in his book Ihya’ Ulumud\-Din\. A few of the important ones are:

1. To make fun of anyone or to make him appear abased\.
2. To make people laugh and to display one’s own jolliness and high spiritedness\.
3. Expressing one’s feelings under the influence of rage and anger\.
4. To establish one’s feelings under the influence of rage and anger\.
5. To disprove one’s connection or involvement in a matter; namely that a particular evil was not committed by oneself but by someone else\.
6. To associate oneself with some group when in their company in order to avoid strangeness with them\.
7. To belittle a person from whom it is feared that he will expose some fault of one’s\.
8. To defeat a competitor in the same calling\.
9. To seek status in the audience of someone in power\.
10. To express sorrow by saying it is sad and so\-and\-so has fallen in such and such a sin\.
11. To express astonishment, for example, to say it is wonderful that so and so has done this\.
12. To name the committer of an act when expressing anger over it\. However, in some cases fault finding or criticizing does not fall under backbiting:\.
13. If the oppressed complains of the oppressor in order to seek redress, it is not backbiting\. Allah says about it:\.

Allah does not love open utterance of evil in speech except by one who has been wronged\(Holy Quran, 4: 148\)\.

1. To relate anyone’s fault while giving advice is not backbiting because dishonesty and duplicity is not permissible in counseling\.
2. If in connection with seeking the requirements of a religious commandment the naming of a particular individual cannot be

<a id="page555"></a>avoided, then to state the fault of such person to the extent necessary will not be backbiting\.

1. To relate the misappropriation or dishonesty committed by someone with a view to saving a Muslim brother from harm will not be backbiting\.
2. To relate the fault of someone before one who can prevent him from committing it is not backbiting\.

6\) Criticism and expression of opinion about a relater of traditions is not backbiting\.

1. If a person is well acquainted with someone’s shortcoming, then to relate such a fault in order to define his personality, for example, describing a deaf, dumb, lame or handless person as thus, is not backbiting\.
2. To describe any fault of a patient before a physician for purposes of treatment is not backbiting\.
3. If someone claims wrong lineage then to expose his correct lineage is not backbiting\.
4. If the life, property or honor of someone can be protected only by informing him of some fault, it will not be backbiting\.
5. If two persons discuss a fault of another which is already known to both it will not be backbiting, although to avoid discussing it is better, since it is possible one of the two might have forgotten it\.
6. To expose the evils of one who openly commits evils is not backbiting as the tradition runs: “There is no backbiting in the case one who has torn away the veil of shamefulness\.”

**Sermon 140**

**Reliance on Hearsay Revisited**

O people\! If a person knows his brother to be steadfast in faith and of correct ways he should not lend ear to what people may say about him\. Sometimes the bowman shoots arrows but the arrow goes astray; similarly talk can be off the point\. Its wrong perishes, while Allah is the Hearer and the Witness\. There is nothing between truth and falsehood except four fingers\.

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) was asked the meaning of this

whereupon he closed his fingers together and put them between his ear and eye and said the following: “It is falsehood when you say, ‘I have heard so,’ while it is truth when you say, ‘I have seen’\.”

<a id="page556"></a>

**Sermon 141**

**Against Misplaced Generosity**

He who shows generosity to those who have no claim to it or who are not fit for it will not earn anything except the praise of the ignoble and appreciation of bad persons\. Although as long as he continues giving, the ignorant will say how generous his hand is, even though in the affairs of Allah he is a miser\.

Therefore, to whosoever Allah gives wealth he should use it in extending good behavior to his kinsmen, in entertaining, in releasing prisoners and the afflicted; in giving to the poor and to debtors\. And he should endure \(the troubles arising out of\) the fulfillment of rights \(of others\) and hardships in expectation of reward\. Certainly, the achievement of these qualities is the height of greatness in this world and achievement of the distinctions of the next world, if Allah so wills\.

**Sermon 142**

**Praying for Rain**

Beware; the earth which bears you and the sky which overshadows you are obedient to their Sustainer \(Allah\)\. They have not been bestowing their blessings on you for any feeling of pity on you or inclination towards you, nor for any good which they expect from you\. But they were commanded to bestow benefits on you and they are obeying and were asked to maintain your good and so they are maintaining it\.

Certainly, Allah tries his creatures with regard to their evil deeds by decreasing fruits, holding back blessings and closing the treasures of good, so that he who wishes to repent may repent, he who wishes to turn away \(from evils\) may turn away, he who wishes to recall \(forgotten good\) may recall and he who wishes to abstain \(from evil\) may abstain\. Allah, the Glorified One, has made the seeking of \(His\) forgiveness a means for the pouring down of livelihood and mercy on the people as Allah has said the following:

Seek the forgiveness, all of you, of your Lord\! Verily, He is the most forgiving, He will send \(down\) upon you the cloud raining in torrents and help you with wealth and sons \(children\)\. \(Holy Quran, 17: 10\-12\)\.

<a id="page557"></a>Allah may shower mercy on him who took up repentance, gave up sins and hastened \(in performing good deeds before\) his death\.

O Lord\! we have come out to You from under the curtains and coverings \(of houses\) when the beasts and children are crying, seeking Your Mercy, hoping for the generosity of Your bounty and fearing Your chastisement and retribution\. O Lord\! give us to drink from Your rain and do not disappoint us, nor kill us by years \(of drought\) nor punish us for what the foolish among us have committed, O the most Merciful of all\.

O Lord\! We have come out to You to complain to You what is \(already\) not hidden from You, when the seven troubles have forced us, droughty famines have driven us, distressing wants have made us helpless and troublesome mischief has incessantly befallen us\. O Lord\! we beseech You not to send us back disappointed, nor to return us with down\-cast eyes, nor to address us \(harshly\) for our sins, nor deal with us according to our deeds\.

O Lord\! Do pour on us Your mercy, Your blessing, Your sustenance and Your pity and make us enjoy a drink which benefits us, quenches our thirst, produces green herbage with which all that was lost gets a growing and all that had withe red comes to life again\. It should bring about the benefit of freshness and plenty of ripe fruits\. With it plains may be watered, rivers may begin flowing, plants may pick up foliage and prices may come down\. Surely, You are powerful over whatever You wills\.

**Sermon 143**

**Deputation of the Prophet \(h\)**

Allah deputed prophets and distinguished them with His revelation\. He made them as pleas for Him among His creation, so that there should not remain any excuse for people\. He invited people to the right path through a truthful tongue\. You should know that Allah fully knows creation\. Not that He was not aware of what they concealed from among their hidden secrets and inner feelings, but in order to try them as to whom from among them performs good deeds, so that there is reward with regard to good deeds and chastisement with regard to evil acts\.

<a id="page558"></a>**The status of Ahl al\-Bayt \(x\) \(the Household of the Holy Prophet \[h\]\)**

Where are those who falsely and unjustly claimed that they are deeply versed in knowledge, as against us, although Allah raised us in status and kept them down, bestowed upon us knowledge but deprived them and entered us \(in the fortress of knowledge\) but kept them out\. With us guidance is to be sought and blindness \(of misguidance\) is to be changed into brightness\. Surely Imams \(the Divine leaders\) will be from the tribesmen of Quraish\. They have been planted in this line through Hashim\. It will not suit others nor will others be suitable as heads of affairs\.

**Part of the same sermon about those who are against Ahl al\-Bayt \(x\)\.**

They have adopted this world and abandoned the next world; left clean water and drunk stinking water\. I can almost see their wicked one1 who committed unlawful acts, associated himself with them, befriended them and accorded with them till his hair became gray and his nature acquired their tinge\. He proceeded onward emitting foam like a torrential stream not caring whom he drowned, or, like fire in straw, without realizing what he burnt\.

Where are the minds which seek light from the lamps of guidance and the eyes which look at minarets of piety? Where are the hearts dedicated to Allah and devoted to the obedience of Allah? they are all crowding towards worldly vanities and quarreling over unlawful issues\. The ensigns of Paradise and Hell have been raised for them but they have turned their faces away from Paradise and proceeded to Hell by dint of their performances\. Allah called them but they showed dislike and ran away\. When Satan called them they responded and proceeded \(towards him\)\.

The reference stated above is to Abdul\- Malik ibn Marwan who committed extreme atrocities through his officer al\-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf ath\-Thaqafi\.

**Sermon 144**

**About this World**

<a id="page559"></a>O people\! You are, in this world, the target for the arrows of death\. With every drinking there is choking and with every eating there is suffocation\. You do not get any benefit in it except by foregoing another \(benefit\) and no one among you advances in age by a day except by the taking away of a day from his life\. Nothing more is added to his eating unless it reduces what was there before\. No mark appears for him unless a mark disappears\. Nothing new comes into being unless the new becomes old\. No new crop comes up unless a crop has been reaped\. Those roots are gone whose off\-shoots we are\. How can an off\-shoot live after the departure of its root?

**Part of the same sermon: on Innovation \(bid’a\):**\.

No innovation is introduced unless one Sunnah is forsaken, keep away from innovations and stick to the broad road\. Surely the old tested ways are he best and the innovated ones are bad\.

**Sermon 145**

**Delivered When Umar Ibn al\-Khattab Consulted Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) about Taking Part in the Battle of Then Persia**\.

Victory or defeat is not dependent on the small or the large number of forces\. It is Allah’s religion which He has raised above all faiths and His army which He has mobilized and extended, till it has reached the point where it stands now and has arrived its present positions\. We hold a promise from Allah and He will fulfil His promise and support His army\.

The status of the head of government is that of the thread for beads, as it connects them and keeps them together\. If the thread is broken, they will disperse and be lost and will never come together again\. The Arabs today, even though small in number are big because of Islam and strong because of unity\. You should remain like the axis for them and rotate the mill \(of government\) with \(the help of\) the Arabs and be their root\. Avoid battle because if you leave this place the Arabs will attack you from all sides and directions till the unguarded places left behind by you will become more important than those before you\.

If the Persians see you tomorrow they will say, “He is the root \(chief\) of Arabia\. If we do away with him we will be in peace\. In this way this will heighten their eagerness against you and their keenness to aim at

<a id="page560"></a>you\. You say that they have set out to fight against the Muslims\. Well, Allah detests their setting out more than you do and He is more capable of preventing what He detests\. As regarding your idea about their \(large\) number, in the past we did not fight on the strength of large numbers but we fought on the basis of Allah’s support and assistance\.”

When some people advised Umar to partake in the battle of Qadisiyya or Nahawand, he found it against his personal inclination, so he though it necessary to consult Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\. This way, if

the Imam \(x\) advised him against it, he would plead to others to stay back based on Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s advice\. But if the Imam \(x\) advised him to participate in the battle, some other excuse would be found\. However, unlike others, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) advised him to stay\. Other people had advised him to join in fighting because the Holy Prophet \(h\) did not send only others to fight but took part in it himself as well, keeping his close relations also with him\. What Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had in view was that Omer’s presence in the battle could not be

beneficial to Islam, but rather his staying back will save the Muslims from dispersion\.

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s view that Athe status of the head of government is that of the axis around which the system of the government rotates is a point of principle and does not concern any particular personality\. whether the ruler is a Muslim or an unbeliever, just or despotic, virtuous or vicious, for the administration of the state his presence is a necessity, as Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has explained

elsewhere at greater length:\.

The fact is that there is no escape for men from a ruler, good or bad\. Faithful persons perform \(good\) acts in his rule while the unfaithful enjoys \(worldly\) benefits in it\. During the rule, Allah will carry everything to its end\. Through the ruler tax is collected, the enemy is fought, roads are protected and the right of the weak is taken from the strong till the virtuous enjoy peace and are allowed protection from \(the oppression of\) the wicked\. \(Sermon 40\)\.

The words which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) uttered in his

advice are not indicative of any quality of Umar except his being the ruler\. There is no doubt that he held worldly authority, irrespective of the question of whether it was secured in the right way or wrong way\. And where there is authority there is centering of people’s affairs\. That is why

<a id="page561"></a>Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said that if Umar will go out the Arabs will

follow him in large numbers towards the battlefield because when the ruler is on the march the people will not like to stay behind\. The result of their going will be that city after city will become vacant, while the enemy will infer from their reaching the battlefield that the Islamic cities are lying vacant and that if these people were repulsed no assistance will reach the Muslims from the center\. Again, if the ruler were killed the army will disperse automatically because the ruler is as its foundation\. When the foundation is shaken the walls cannot remain standing\. The word Aslul\-Arab \(the root chief\) of Arabia has not been used by Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) as his own but he has taken it from the Persians\.

Obviously in his capacity as the head of the State, Umar was, in their view, the chief of Arabia\. Besides, the reference is to the country, not to Islam or Muslims, so that there is no suggestion of any importance for him from the Islamic point of view\.

When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) pointed out to Umar that on

his reaching there the Persians will aim at him and that if he fell into their hands they will not spare him without killing, although such words will have touched the brave to the quick and will have heightened their spirits, \`Umar liked the advice to stay back and thought it better to keep himself away from the flames of battle\. If this advice had not been in accord with his personal inclination he will not have received it so heartily and will have tried to argue that the administration of the country could be maintained by leaving a deputy\. Again when other people had already advised him to go out, what was the need for consulting Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) except to get an excuse to stay back\.

**Sermon 146**

**The Purpose of the Deputation of the Holy Prophet \(h\) and**

**the Condition of the Time When People Will Go Against the Holy Quran :**\.

Allah deputed Muhammad \(h\) with Truth so that he may take

out His people from the worship of idols towards His worship and from obeying Satan towards obeying Him and sent him with the Holy Quran which He explained and made strong, in order that the people may know their Sustainer \(Allah\) since they were ignorant of Him, may acknowledge Him since they were denying Him and accept Him since they were refusing \(to believe in\) Him\. Because He the Glorified One,

<a id="page562"></a>revealed Himself to them through His Book without their having seen Him, by means of what He showed them out of His might and made them fear His sway\. How He destroyed those whom He wished to destroy through His chastisement and ruined those whom He wished to ruin through His retribution\!

**On the Future**

Certainly, a time will come upon you after me when nothing will be more concealed than rightfulness, nothing more apparent than wrongfulness \- and nothing more current than untruth against Allah and His Prophet \(h\)\. For the people of this period nothing will be more

valueless than the Holy Quran being recited as it ought to be recited, nor anything more valuable than the Holy Quran being misplaced from its status\. And in the towns nothing will be more hated than virtue, nor anything more acceptable than vice\.

The holders of the book will throw it away and those who memorize it will forget it\. In these days the Holy Quran and its people will be exiled and expelled\. They will be companions keeping together on one path, but no one will offer them asylum\. Consequently at this time the Holy Quran and its people will be among the people but not among them, will be with them but not with them because misguidance cannot accord with guidance even though they may be together\. The people will have united on division and will, therefore, have cut away from the community, as though they were the leaders of the Holy Quran and not the Holy Quran their leader\. Nothing of it will be left with them except its name and they will know nothing save its writing and its words\. Before that, they will inflict hardships on the virtuous, naming the latter’s truthful views about Allah false allegations and enforcing for virtues the punishment of the vice\.

Those before you passed away because of the lengthening of their desires and the forgetting of their death, till that promised event befell them about which excuses are turned down, repentance is denied and punishment and retribution is inflicted\.

**About Ahl al\-Bayt \(x\)**

O people\! He who seeks counsel from Allah secures guidance and he who adopts His word as guide is led towards what is more straight because Allah’s lover feels secure and His opponent feels afraid\. It does

<a id="page563"></a>not behoove one who knows His greatness to assume greatness, but the greatness of those who know His greatness is that they should know before Him and the safety for those who know what His power is lies in submitting to Him\. Do not be scared away from the truth like the scaring of the healthy from the scabbed person, or the sound person from the sick\.

You should know that you will never know guidance unless you know who has abandoned it, you will never abide by the pledges of the Holy Quran unless you know who has broken them and will never cling to it unless you know who has forsaken it\. Seek these things from those who own them because they are the life spring of knowledge and death of ignorance\. They are the people whose commands will disclose to you their \(extent of\) knowledge, their silence will disclose their \(capacity of\) speaking and their outer appearance will disclose their inner self\. They do not go against religion and do not differ from one other about it, while it is among them a truthful witness and a silent speaker\.

**Sermon 147**

**About Talhah and az\-Zubayr and the People of Basra**

Both of these men \(Talhah and az\- Zubayr\) wish the Caliphate for himself and is drawing towards himself as against the other fellow\. They do not employ any connection for getting access to Allah nor proceed towards Him through any means\. Both of them bear malice against the other\. Shortly his veil over it will be uncovered\. But Allah, if they achieve what they aim at, one of them will kill the other and one will finish the other\. The rebellious party has stood u, p\. Where are the seekers of virtue; for the paths have already been determined and they have been given thenews\. For every misguidance there is a cause and for every break of pledge there is a misrepresentation\. By Allah, I shall not be like him who listens to the voice of mourning, hears the man who brings news of death and also visits themourner yet does not take lesson\.

**Sermon 148**

**Before His Passing Away \(Last Will\)**

<a id="page564"></a>O people\! Everyone has to meet what he wishes to avoid by running away\.168 Death is the place to which life is driving\. To run away from it means to catch it\. How many days did I spent in searching for the secret of this matter, but Allah did not allow save its concealment\. Alas\! It is a treasured knowledge\. As for my last will, it is that concerning Allah, do not believe in a partner for Him and concerning Muhammad \(h\), do

not disregard his Sunnah\. Keep these two pillars and burn these two lamps\. Till you are not divided, no evil will come to you\.169 Everyone of you has to bear his own burden\. It has been kept light for the ignorant\. Allah is Merciful\. Faith is straight\. The leader \(Prophet \[h\]\) is the holder

of knowledge\. Yesterday I was with you; today I have become the object of a lesson for you, and tomorrow I shall leave you\. Allah may forgive me and you\.

If the foot remains firm in this slippery place, well and good\. But if the foot slips, This is so because we are under the shade of branches, the passing of the winds and the canopy of the clouds whose layers are dispersed in the sky and whose traces disappeared170 in the earth\. I was your neighbor\. My body kept you company for some days and shortly you will find just an empty body of mine which will be stationary after \(all its\) movement and silent after speech so that my calmness, the closing of my eyes and the stillness of my limbs may provide you counsel because it is more of a counsel for those who learn a lesson \(from it\) than eloquent speech and a ready word\. I am departing from you like one who is eager to meet \(someone\)\. Tomorrow you will look at my days, then my inner side will be disclosed to you and you will understand me after the vacation of my place and its occupation by someone else\.

**Sermon 149**

**About Future Events and Some Activities of the Hypocrites**

168This means that during all the time spent in the attempts that a man makes to avoid death and in the means he adopts for it, it is only the span of life that is shortened\. As the time passes the objective of death approaches near, so much as that in one’s attempt to seek life one meets death\.

169*Awa khalakum dhammun *\(No evil will come to you\)\. This sentence\* \*is used as a proverb\. It was first employed by Qasir, slave of Khazimah ibn Malik al\-Abrash\.

170The intention is that when all these things die, how can those who inhabit them remain safe? Certainly they too, like everything else, have to pass away some day or other\. Then why should there be any wonder at my life coming to an end?

<a id="page565"></a>They took to the right and the left piercing through to the ways of evil and leaving the paths of guidance\. Do not make haste for a matter which is to happen and is awaited and do not wish for delay in what the morrow is to bring for you\. For, how many people make haste for a matter, but when they get it they begin to wish they had not got it\. How near is today to the dawning of tomorrow\. O my people, this is the time for the occurrence of every promised event and the approach of things which you do not know\. Whoever from among us will be during these days will move through them with a burning lamp and will tread on the footsteps of the virtuous, in order to unfasten knots, to free slates, to divide the united and to unite the divided\. He will be in concealment from people\. The stalker will not find his footprints even though he pursues with his eye\. Then a group of people will be sharpened like the sharpening of swords by the blacksmith\. Their sight will be brightened by revelation, the \(delicacies of\) commentary will be put in their ears and they will be given drinks of wisdom, morning and evening\.

**Part of the same sermon:**

Their period became long in order that they might complete \(their status of\) disgrace and deserve vicissitudes, till the end of the period was reached and a group of people turned towards mischief and picked up their arms for fighting\. The virtuous did not show any obligation to Allah but calmly endured and did not feel elated for having engaged themselves in truthfulness\. Eventually the period of trial came to an end according to what was ordained\. Then they propagated their good views among others and sought nearness to Allah according to the command of their leader\.

When Allah took the Prophet \(h\) \(to himself\) a group of men

went back on their tracks\. The ways \(of misguidance\) ruined them and they placed trust in deceitful intriguers, showed consideration to other than kinsmen, abandoned the kin whom they had been ordered to love and shifted the building from its strong foundation and built it in other than its \(proper\) place\. They are the source of every shortcoming and the door of gropes in the dark\. They were moving to and fro in amazement and lay intoxicated in the way of the people of the Pharaohs\. They were either bent on this world and taking support on it or away from the fait and removed from it\.

<a id="page566"></a>

**Sermon 150**

**The Condition of the People During Disorder and Advice Against Oppression and Unlawful Earning**

I praise Allah and seek His help from \(what led to the \) punishment of Satan and his deceitful acts and \(I seek His\) protection from Satan’s traps and way\-layings\. I testify that there is no god but Allah and I testify that Muhammad \(h\) is His slave and His Prophet \(h\) \-

peace be upon him and his progeny \- and his chosen and his selected one\. Muhammad’s distinction cannot be paralleled nor can his loss be made good\. Populated places were brightened through him when previously there was dark misguidance, overpowering ignorance and rude habits and people regarded unlawful as lawful, humiliated the man of wisdom, passed lives when there were no prophets and died as unbelievers\.

You, O people of Arabia, will be victims of calamities which have come near\. You should avoid the intoxication of wealth, fear the disasters of chastisement, keep steadfast in the darkness and crookedness of mischief when its hidden nature discloses itself, its secrets become manifest and its axis and the pivot of its rotation gain strength\. It begins in imperceptible stages but develops into great hideousness\. Its youth is like the youth of an adolescent and its marks are like the marks of beating by stone\.

Oppressors inherit it by \(mutual\) agreement\. The first of them serves as a leader for the latter one and the latter one follows the first one\. They vie with each other in \(the matter of\) this lowly world and leap over this stinking carcass\. Shortly the follower will denounce his connection with the leader and the leader with the follower\. They will disunite on account of mutual and curse one another when they meet\. Then after this there will appear another arouser of mischief who will destroy ruined things\. The heart will become wavering after being normal, men will be misled after safety, desires will multiply and become diversified and views will become confused\.

Whoever proceeds towards this mischief will be ruined and whoever strives for it will be annihilated\. They will be biting each other during it as the wild asses bite each other in the herd\. The coils of the rope will be disturbed and the face of affairs will be blinded\. During it sagacity will be on the ebb and the oppressors will \(get the opportunity to\) speak\. Themischief will smash the Bedouins with its hammers and crush them

<a id="page567"></a>with its chest\. In its dust the single marchers will be lost and in its way the horsemen will be destroyed\. It will approach with the bitterness of destiny and will give pure blood \(instead of milk\)\. It will breach the minarets of faith and shatter the ties of firm belief\. The wise will run away from it while the wicked will foster it\. It will thunder and flash \(like lightning\)\. It will create a severe disaster\. In it kinship will be forsaken and Islam will be abandoned\. He who declaims it will also be affected by it and he who flees from it will \(be forced to\) stay in it\.

**Part of the same sermon:**

Among them some will be un\- avenged martyrs and some will be stricken with fear and seek protection\. They will be deceived by pledges and fraudulent belief\. You should not become landmarks of mischief and signs of innovations but should adhere to that on which the rope of the community has been wound and on which the pillars of obedience have been founded\. Proceed towards Allah as oppressed and do not proceed to Him as oppressors\. Avoid the paths of Satan and the places of rebellion\. Do not put in your bellies unlawful morsels because you are facing the One Who has made disobedience unlawful for you and made the path of obedience easy for you\.

**Sermon 151**

**About the greatness and the attributes of Allah**

Praise be to Allah Who is proof of His existence through His creation, of His being external through the newness of His creation and through their mutual similarities of the fact that nothing is similar to Him\. Senses cannot touch Him and curtains cannot veil Him because of the difference between the maker and the made, the Limiter and the limited and the Sustainer and the sustained\.

He is One but not by the first in counting, is Creator but not through activity or labor, is Hearer but not by means of any physical organ, is Looker but not by a stretching of eyelids, is Witness but not by nearness, is Distinct but not by measurement of distances, is Manifest but not by seeing and is Hidden but not by subtlety \(of body\)\. He is Distinct from things because He overpowers them and exercises might over them, while things are distinct from Him because of their subjugation to Him and their turning towards Him\.

<a id="page568"></a>He who describes Him limits Him\. He who limits Him numbers Him\. He who numbers Him rejects His eternity\. He who asks “How?” seeks a description for Him\. He who asks “Where?” limits Him\. He is the One Who knows everything\. He is the Sustainer even though there be nothing to be sustained\. He is the Powerful One even though there is nothing to be overpowered\.

**Part of the same sermon about the Divine leaders \(Imams\)**

The riser has risen, the sparkler has sparkled, the what appears has appeared and the curved has been straightened\. Allah has replaced one people with another and one day with another\. We awaited these changes as the famine\-stricken await the rain\. Certainly the Imams are the vicegerents of Allah over His creatures and they make the creatures know Allah\. No one will enter Paradise except he who knows them and knows Him and no one will enter Hell except he who denies them and denies Him\.

Allah, the most Glorified One, has distinguished you with Islam and has chosen you for it\. This is so because it is the name of safety and the collection of honor\. Allah, the most Glorified One, chose its way and disclosed its pleas through open knowledge and secret maxims\. Its \(Holy Quran\) wonders are not exhausted and its delicacies do not end\. It contains blossoming bounties and lamps of darkness\. \(The doors of\) virtues cannot be opened save with its keys, nor can gloom be dispelled save with its lamps\. Allah has protected its inaccessible points \(from enemies\) and allowed grazing \(to its followers\) in its pastures\. It contains cover \(from the ailment of misguidance\) for the seeker of cure and full support for the seeker of support\.

The first part of this sermon consists of important issues concerning the science of knowledge about Allah, wherein Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has thrown light on the matter that Allah is forever and His

attributes are the same as He Himself\. When we cast a glance at creation, we see that for every movement there is a mover, from which every man of ordinary wisdom is compelled to conclude that no effect can appear without a cause, so much so, that even an infant a few days old, when his body is touched, feels in the depth of his consciousness that someone has touched him\. He indicates it by opening his eyes or turning and looking\. How then can the creation of the world and the system of all creation be arranged without a Creator or Organizer? Once it is necessary to believe in a Creator, then He should exist by Himself because everything which has a beginning must have a center of existence from which it should

<a id="page569"></a>terminate\. If that too needed a creator, there will be the question of whether this creator is also the creation of some other creator or exists by itself\. Thus unless a Self\-created Creator is believed in, who should be the cause of all causes, the mind will remain groping in the unending labyrinth of cause and effect and never attain the idea of the last extremity of the series of creation\. It will fall into the fallacy of circular arguing and will not reach any end\. If the creator were taken to have created himself, then there will be \(one of the two positions, namely\) either he should be non\-existent or existent\. If he were not existent, then it will not be possible for something non\-existent to create any existent being\. If he were existent before creating himself, there will be no sense in coming into being again, therefore, it is necessary to believe that the Creator should be a Being not dependent on any other creator for His own existence and everything else should be dependent on Him\. This dependence of the entire creation is a proof that the existence of the Source of all creation is from ever and eternal\. And since all beings other than He are subject to change, are dependent on status and place and are similar to one another in qualities and properties and since similarity leads to plurality whereas unity has no like save itself, therefore, nothing can be like Him\. Even things called one cannot be reckoned after His Unity because He is One and Singular in every respect\. He is free and pure from all those attributes which are found in body or matter because He is neither body, nor color, nor shape, nor does He lie in any direction, nor is He bounded within some place or locality\. Therefore, man cannot see or understand Him through his senses or feelings because senses can know only those things which accord with the limitations of time, place and matter\. To believe that He can be seen is to believe that He has body, but since He is not a body and He does not exist through a body and He does not lie in any direction or place, there is no question of His being seen\. But His being unseen is not like that of subtle material bodies, due to whose delicacy the eye pierces through them and eyes remain unable to see them; as for example the wind in the vast firmament\. But He is the unseen by His very existence\. Nevertheless, nothing is unseen for Him\. He sees as well as hears, but is not dependent on instruments of seeing or hearing because if He were in need of organs of the body for hearing and seeing He will be in need of external things for His perfection and will not be a perfect Being, whereas He should be perfect in all respects and no attribute of perfection should be apart from His Self\. To believe in attributes separately from His Self will mean that there will be a self and a few attributes and the compound of the self and the attributes will be Allah\. But a thing which is compounded is dependent on its parts and these parts must exist before their composition into the whole\. When the parts exist from before, how can the whole be from ever and eternal

<a id="page570"></a>because its existence is later than that of its parts\. But Allah had the attributes of knowledge, power and sustaining even when nothing was existent because none of His attributes were created in Him from outside, but His attributes are His Self and His Self is His attributes\. Consequently, His knowledge does not depend on the object of knowledge existing first then His knowledge because His Self is prior to things coming into existence\. Nor is it necessary for His power that there should first exist the object to be over\-powered then alone He will be called Powerful because Powerful is that who has power equally for doing or abandoning and as such the existence of the object to be over\-powered is not necessary\. Similarly Sustainer means master\. Just as He is the master of thenon\-existent after its coming into existence, in the same way He has power to bring it into existence from non\-existence, namely if He so wills He may bestow existence upon it\.

**Sermon 152**

**About Negligent Persons and the Characteristics of Beasts, Carnivores and Women**

He has been allowed time by Allah\. He is falling into error along with negligent persons and goes early in the morning with the sinners, without any road to lead or any Imam to guide\.

**Part of the same sermon:**

At last, when Allah will make clear to them the reward for their sins and take them out from the veils of their neglectfulness, they will proceed to what they were running away from and run away from what they were proceeding to\. They will not benefit from the wants they will satisfy or the desires they will fulfil\.

I warn you and my own self from this situation\. A man should derive benefit from his own self\. Certainly, prudent is he who hears and ponders over it, who sees and observes and who benefits from instructive material then treads on clear paths wherein he avoids falling into hollows and straying into pitfalls and does not assist those who misguide him by turning away from truthfulness, changing his words or fearing truth\.

O my listener\! Be cured from your intoxication, wake up from your slumber, decrease your hasty activity and ponder over what has

<a id="page571"></a>come to you through the Holy Prophet \(h\), the Ummi171 which is

inevitable and inescapable\. You should turn away from him who opposes him and leave him and leave whatever he has adopted for himself\. Put off your vanity, drop your haughtiness and recall your grave because your way passes over it\. You will be dealt with as you deal with others, you will reap what you sow and what you send today will meet you tomorrow\. So provide for your future and send \(some good deeds\) for your day \(of reckoning\)\. Fear, fear, O listener\! Act, act, O careless one\! No one will warn you like him who knows\.

One of the firm decisions of Allah in the Wise Reminder \(Holy Quran\) upon which He bestows reward or gives punishment and through which He likes or dislikes is that it will not benefit a man, even though he exerts himself and acts sincerely if he leaves this world to meet Allah with one of these acts without repenting, namely that he believed in a partner with Allah during his obligatory worship, or appeased his own anger by killing an individual, or spoke about acts committed by others, or sought fulfillment of his needs from people by introducing an innovation in his religion, or met people with a double face, or moved among them with a double tongue\. Understand this because an illustration is a guide for its like\.

Beasts are concerned with their bellies\. Carnivores are concerned with assaulting others\. Women are concerned with the adornments of this

ignoble life and the creation of mischief herein\.172 Ibn Abul\-Hadid

171The word _Ummi_ has been used in the Holy Quran with reference to the Holy Prophet \(h\) in 7: 157\-158\. For better understanding of the word, refer

to the books of commentary on the Holy Quran\.

172The intention is to say that the cause of all mischief and evil is the passion to satisfy bodily needs and the passion to subdue\. If a human being is subjugated by the passion to satisfy bodily needs and considers filling the stomach as his aim there will be no difference between him and a beast because a beast too has no aim except to fill its belly\. But if he is over\-powered by the passion to subdue others and takes to killing and devastation there will be no difference between him and a carnivorous beast because the latter’s aim is also tearing and devouring\. If both the passions are at work in him then he is like a woman because in a woman both these passions act side by side and because of this she is extremely eager of adornment and is active in fanning mischief and disturbance\. However, a true believer will never agree to adopt these habits as his mode of behavior, rather he keeps his passions suppressed so that he neither allows pride and vanity to approach near him nor does he fan mischief or disturbance for fear of Allah\.

<a id="page572"></a>has written that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) delivered this sermon at the time of marching towards Basra and since the trouble of Basra was the result of a woman’s instigation\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has, after

mentioning beasts and carnivore, held a woman also to possess such qualities\. Thus the battle of Basra was the result of these qualities, whereby thousands of persons were involved in death and destruction\.

\(On the other hand\) believers are humble, believers are admonishers and believers are afraid \(of Allah\)\.

**Sermon 153**

**About Ahl al\-Bayt \(x\) and their Opponents**

He who has an intelligent mind looks to his goal\. He knows his low road as well as his high road\. The caller has called\. The shepherd has tended \(his flocks\)\. So respond to the caller and follow the shepherd\.

Those who oppose have entered the oceans of disturbance and have taken to innovations instead of the Sunnah \(the Prophet’s holy deeds, utterances and his unspoken approvals\), while the believers have sunk down and the misguided and the liars are speaking\. We are the near ones, companions, treasure holders and doors \(to the Sunnah\)\. Houses are not entered save through their doors\. Whoever enters them from other than the door is called a thief\.

**Part of the same sermon:**

The delights of the Holy Quran are about them \(Ahl al\-Bayt \[x\], descendants of the Prophet \[h\]\)\. They are the treasurers of Allah\. When

they speak, they tell the truth, but when they keep quiet, no one can speak unless they speak\. The forerunner should report correctly to his people, should retain his wits and should be one of the children \(a man\) of the next world because he has come from there and will return to it\.

The beginning of the action of one who sees with the heart and acts with the eyes is to assess whether the action will go against him or for him\. If it is for him he indulges in it, but if it is against him he keeps away from it\. For, he who acts without knowledge is like one who treads without a path\. Then his deviation from the path keeps him at a distance from his aim\. And he who acts according to knowledge is like he who

<a id="page573"></a>treads the clear path\. Therefore, he who can see should see whether he should proceed or return\.

You should also know that the outside \(of everything\) has a similar inside\. Of whatever the outside is good, its inside too is good and whatever the outside is bad, its inside too is bad\. The truthful Prophet \(k\)

has said that: “Allah may love a man but hate his action and may love the action but hate the man\. You should also know that every action is like vegetation and vegetation cannot do without water while waters are different\. So where the water is good the plant is good and its fruits are sweet, whereas where the water is bad, the plant will also be bad and its fruits will be bitter\.

**Sermon 154**

**About the Wonderful Creation of the Bat**

Praise to Allah Who is such that it is not possible to describe the reality of knowledge about Him, since His greatness has restrained the intellects and, therefore, they cannot find the way to approach the extremity of His realm\. He is Allah, the True, the manifester of Truth\. He is more True and more Manifest than eyes can see\. Intellects cannot comprehend Him by fixing limits for Him since in that case to Him will be to attribute shape\. Imagination cannot catch Him by fixing quantities for Him for in that case to Him will be attributed body\. He created creatures without any example and without the advice of a counsel, or the assistance of a helper\. His creation was completed by His command and bowed to His obedience\. It responded \(to Him\) and did not defy \(Him\)\. It obeyed and did not resist\.

An example of His delicate production, wonderful creation and deep sagacity which He has shown us is found in these bats which keep hidden in the daylight although daylight reveals everything else and are mobile in thenight although thenight shuts up every other living being, and how their eyes get dazzled and cannot make use of the light of the sun so as to be guided in their movements and so as to reach their known places through the direction provided by the sun\.

Allah has prevented them from moving in the brightness of the sun and confined them to their places of hiding instead of going out at the time of its shining\. Consequently they keep their eyelids down in the day and treat night as a lamp and go with its help in search of their livelihood\.

<a id="page574"></a>The darkness of night does not obstruct their sight nor does the gloom of darkness prevent them from movement\. As soon as the sun removes its veil and the light of morning appears and the rays of its light enter upon the lizards in their holes, the bats pull down their eyelids on their eyes and live on what they had collected in the darkness of thenight\. Glorified is He who has made thenight as day for them to seek livelihood and made the day for rest and stay\.

He has given them wings of flesh with which, at the time of need, they rise upwards for flying\. They look like the ends of ears without feathers or bones\. Of course, you can see the veins quite distinctly\. They have two wings which are neither too thin so that get turned in flying, nor too thick so that they prove heavy\. When they fly their young ones hold on to them and seek refuge with them, getting down when they get down and rising up when they rise\. The young does not leave them till its limbs become strong, its wings can support it for rising and it begins to recognize its places of living and its interest\. Glorified is He who creates everything without any previous sample by someone else\.

**About the Malice Borne by Aisha, and Warning the People of Basra about What Was to Occur**

Whoever can at this time keep himself clinging to Allah should do so\. If you follow me I shall certainly carry you, if Allah so wills, on the path of Paradise, even though it may be full of severe hardship and of bitter taste\.

As regarding a certain woman, she is in the grip of womanly views and malice is boiling in her bosom like the furnace of the blacksmith\. If she were called upon to deal with others as she is dealing with me she will not have done it\. \(As for me\), even hereafter she will be allowed her original respect, while the reckoning \(of her misdeeds\) is an obligation of Allah\.

**Part of the same sermon:**

This path is the lightest course and the brightest lamp\. Guidance towards virtuous actions is sought through faith while guidance towards faith is achieved through virtuous actions\. Knowledge is made to prosper through faith and death is feared because of knowledge\. This world comes

<a id="page575"></a>to an end with death, while the next world is secured \(by virtuous actions\) in this world\. For people there is no escape from resurrection\. They are heading for this last end in its appointed course\.

**Part of the same sermon:**

They have got up from the resting places in their graves and have set off for the final objectives\. Every house has its own people\. They are not changed nor shifted from the re\. Commanding for good and refraining from evil are two characteristics of Allah, the Glorified\. They can neither bring death near nor lessen sustenance\.

You should adhere to the Book of Allah because it is the strong rope, a clear light, a benefiting cure, a quenching for thirst, protection for the adherent and deliverance for the attached\. It does not curve so as to need straightening and does not deflect so as to be corrected\. Frequency of its repetition and its falling on ears does not make it old\. Whoever speaks according to it, speaks truth and whoever acts by it is forward \(in action\)\.

A man stood up and said the following: “O Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\! Tell us about this disturbance and whether you inquired about it from the Holy Prophet \(h\)\.” Thereupon, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said the following:

When Allah, the Glorified sent down the verse: “Aleef laam meem \(A\.L\.M\.\) What?\! Do people imagine that they will be let off on \(their\) saying: ‘We believe\!’ and they will not be tried?\!” \(Holy Quran,

1. 1\-2\), I came to know that the disturbance will not befall us so long as the Prophet \(k\) is among us\. So I said, “O Prophet of Allah \(k\)\! What is

this disturbance of which Allah, the Sublime, has informed you?” He replied, “O Ali\! My people will create trouble after me\.” I said, “O Prophet of Allah \(k\)\! On the day of Uhud, when people had fallen

martyrs and I was not among them, and this had been very much annoying me, did you not say to me, \`Cheer up, for martyrdom is yours later on’?” The Prophet \(h\) replied, “Yes it is so, but what about you

enduring the present?” I said, “O Prophet of Allah \(k\)\! This is not an occasion for endurance, but rather an occasion for cheering up and gratitude\.” Then he said the following: “O Ali \(x\)\! People will fall into

mischief through their wealth, will show obligation to Allah on account of their faith, will expect His mercy, will feel safe from His anger and regard

<a id="page576"></a>His unlawful matters as lawful by raising false doubts and by their misguiding desires\. They will then hold lawful \(the use of\) wine by calling it barley water, a bribe by calling it a gift and taking of usurious interest by calling it sale\.” I said, “O Prophet of Allah \(k\)\! How should I

deal with them at the time, whether to hold them to have gone back in heresy or just in rebellion?” He said, “In rebellion\.”

There is no denying the fact that Aisha’s behavior towards Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) was throughout inimical and very often her heart’s

turbidity expressed itself on her face and her hatred and dislike became quite apparent, so much so that if in connection with some affair Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s name came up a frown appeared on her forehead and she did not relish pronouncing it with her tongue\. For example, when Ubaydullah ibn \`Abdillah ibn \`Utbah mentioned to Abdullah ibn Abbas thenarration by Aisha namely that Ain his death\-illness the Prophet \(h\),

taking support on al\-Fadl ibn Abbas and another person, came to her \(Aisha’s\) house, Abdullah ibn Abbas said the following: “Do you know who this Other man’ was?” He said, “No\.” Then he said, “Ali \(x\) ibn Abu

Talib, but she is averse to name him in a good context” \(Ahmed ibn Hanbal Al\-Musnad, Vol\. 6, pp\. 34, 228; Ibn Sa\`d, Al\-Tabaqat al\-Kubra, Vol\. 2, part 2, p\. 29 al\-Tabari, Tarikh, Vol\. 1, pp\. 1800\-1801\. Al\-Baladhiri, Ansab al\-Ashraf, Vol\. 1, pp\. 544\-545; al\-Bayhaqi, Al\-Sunan al\-Kubra, Vol\. 3, p\. 396\)\.

One cause for this hatred and malice was the presence of Hadrat Fatima \(x\) whose wholesome dignity and esteem pricked her heart like a thorn\. Her jealousy towards the other wives \(of the Prophet \(h\)\) did not allow her to let the Prophet \(h\) love the daughter of his other wife to

such a degree that he should stand on her approach, seat her in his own place, declare her most honorable of all the women of the world and bear such love towards her children as to call them his own sons\. All these things pained her much and naturally her feelings on such an occasion were that if she had borne children they will have been the Prophet’s sons and they will have been the pivot of the Prophet’s affection instead of Ima m Hassan and Imam Hussain\. But she was not gifted with any issue and she gratified her own desire to be a mother by adopting the surname of Umm Abdillah \(mother of the slave of Allah\) after her sister’s son\. In short all these things created the passion of hatred in her heart, as a result of which she off and on complained to the Prophet \(h\) against Fatima \(x\)

but could not succeed in diverting the Prophet’s attention from her\. News about this mortification and estrangement also reached the ears of Abu

<a id="page577"></a>Bakr\. That will only perturb him as he too could do nothing, except that his verbal sympathies were with his daughter\. At last the Prophet \(h\) left

this world and the reins of Government fell into Abu Bakr’s hands\. Now was the opportunity for him to avenge as best as he could and to perpetrate whatever violence he had in mind\. Consequently, the first step he took was that, in order to deprive Fatima \(x\) of inheritance, he denied

the principle of inheritance in the case of the prophets and held that neither do the prophets inherit nor are they inherited, but the property left by them belongs to the State\. Fatima \(x\) was so affected that she gave up

speaking to him and passed away from this world with these very feelings\. Aisha did not even take the trouble to express any sorrow at her tragic death\. Thus ibn Abul\-Hadid has written\.

When Fatima \(x\) expired all the wives of the Prophet \(h\) came

to Banu Hashim in condolence except Aisha\. She did not come and showed herself sick and words from her reached Ali which displayed her joy\. \(Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, p\. 198, Vol\. 9\)\.

As long as she bore so much malice against Fatima \(x\), how

could Fatima’s spouse be spared similar enmity and malice\. Particularly when such events also occurred which worked like a fan and roused her feeling of hatred, such as the incident of ifk when Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said to the Prophet \(h\): “She is no better than the buckles of

your shoe, leave her and divorce her\. On hearing this Aisha must have felt miserable in her bed and must have developed the severest feeling of hatred against him\. There were also moments when distinction was conferred on Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) in preference to Abu Bakr\. For instance, in connection with the dispatch of the Quranic verses on Bara’ah \(innocence\), the Prophet \(h\) removed Abu Bakr from the job, recalled

him and assigned it to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) saying that he had been commanded by Allah to take it himself or send it through a member of his family\. Similarly the Prophet \(h\) closed all the doors opening into

the mosque including that of Abu Bakr but allowed the door of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s house to continue to open\.

Aisha could not relish Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s distinction over her father and whenever there was any occasion for such distinction she did her best to undo it\. When in his last days the Prophet \(h\) ordered the

contingent under Usamah ibn Zayd to march and ordered Abu Bakr and Umar also to go under his command, they received a message from the

<a id="page578"></a>wives of the Prophet \(h\) that his condition was serious and, therefore,

the contingent should come back instead of proceeding further\. This was because their far\-reaching sight had realized that their only purpose in getting Medina vacated by the Muhajirun and the Ansar could be that after the death of the Prophet \(h\) no one should stand in Imam Ali ibn

Abu Talib’s way and that he should get the caliphate without any trouble\.

On receipt of this message the contingent under Usamah came back\.

When the Prophet \(h\) learned this he again ordered Usamah to march

with the contingent and even said, “Allah may curse him who keeps away from the contingent, whereupon they again set off, but they were again called back till the Prophet’s illness assumed serious proportions, but Usamah’s contingent did not go out as it did not want to\. After this Abu Bakr was sent word through Bilal that he should deputize the Prophet \(h\)

in leading the prayers in order to pave the way for his Caliphate\. Accordingly keeping this in view he was first shown as the Prophet’s caliph \(deputy\) in prayers and eventually was accepted as his caliph for all purposes\. Thereafter matters were so contrived that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) could not get the Caliphate\. However, after the reign of the third

caliph circumstances took such a turn that people were obliged to swear the oath of allegiance to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s hand\. On this occasion Aisha was present in Mecca\. When she learned about Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s caliphate her eyes began emitting flames and rage and anger perturbed her mind and her hatred for Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

assumed such seriousness that she rose against him on the excuse of avenging blood of the same man \(Othman\) whom she had herself proclaimed fit to be killed and openly declared war as a result of which so much bloodshed occurred that the whole land of Basra was smeared with the blood of those killed and the door of disunity was opened for good, according to Sharh, Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 9, pp\. 190\-200\.

**Sermon 156**

**Urging People Towards Piety \(Taqwa\)**

Praise be to Allah Who made praise the key for His remembrance, a means for an increase of His bounty and a guide for His Attributes and Dignity\.

O servants of Allah\! Time will deal with the survivors just as it dealt with those gone by\. The time that has passed will not return and whatever there is in it will not stay for ever\. Its later deeds are the same as

<a id="page579"></a>the former ones\. Its trouble try to excel one another\. Its banners follow each other\. It is as though you are attached to the last day which is driving you as rapidly as are driven the she\-camels which are dry for seven months\. He who busies himself with things other than improvement of his own self becomes perplexed in darkness and entangled in ruination\. His evil spirits immerse him deep in vices and make his bad actions appear handsome\. Paradise is the end of those who are forward \(in good deeds\) and Hell is the end of those who commit excesses\.

Know O servants of Allah\! that piety is a strong house of protection while impiety is a weak house which does not protect its people and does not give security to him who takes refuge the rein\. Be informed that the sting of sins is cut by piety and the final aim is achieved by conviction of belief\.

O servants of Allah\! \(fear\) Allah, \(fear\) Allah, in the matter of your own selves, which are the most beloved and dear to you because Allah has clarified to you the way of truthfulness and has lit its paths\. So \(you may choose\) either ever\-present misfortune or eternal happiness\. You should, therefore, provide in these mortal days for the eternal days\. You have been informed of the provision, ordered to march and told to make haste in setting off\. You are like staying riders who do not know when they will be ordered to march on\. Beware, what will he, who has been created for the next world, do with this world? What will a person do with wealth which he will shortly be deprived of while only its ill effects and reckoning will be left behind for him?

O servants of Allah\! the good which Allah has promised should not be abandoned and the evil from which He has refrained should not be coveted\. O servants of Allah\! fear the day when actions will be reckoned; there will be much quaking and even children will get old\.

Be informed, O servants of Allah\! that your own self is a guard over you; limbs are watchmen and truthful vigil\-keepers who preserve \(the record of\) your actions and the numbers of your breaths\. The gloom of the dark night cannot conceal you from them, nor can closed doors hide you from them\. Surely tomorrow is close to today\.

Today will depart with all that is has and tomorrow will come in its wake\. It is as though everyone of you has reached that place on earth where he will be alone, namely the location of his grave\. So, what to say of the lonely house, the solitary place of staying and the solitary exile\. It is as though the cry\(of the Horn\) has reached you, the Hour has overtaken

<a id="page580"></a>you and you have come out \(of your graves\) for the passing of judgement\. \(The curtains of\) falsehood have been removed from you and your excuses have become weak\. The truth about you has been proved\. All your matters have proceeded to their consequences\. Therefore, you should \(now\) take counsel from examples, learn lessons from vicissitudes and take advantage of those who warn\.

**Sermon 157**

**About the Holy Prophet \(h\) and the Holy Quran**

Allah deputed the Prophet \(h\) at a time when there had been no prophets for some time\. People had been in slumber for a long time and the twist of the rope had loosened\. The Prophet \(h\) came with \(a Book

containing\) testimonials to what \(Vols\.\) were already there and also with a light to be followed\. It is the Holy Quran\. If you ask it to speak it wo not do so; but I will tell you about it\. Be informed that it contains knowledge of what is to come about, stories of the past, cure for your ills and regulation for whatever faces you\.

**Part of the same sermon: Autocracy of the Umayyads**

At that time, there will remain no house nor tent but oppressors will inflict it with grief and inject sickness in it\. On that day, no one in the sky will listen to their excuse, and no one on the earth will come to their help\. You selected for the government \(caliphate\) one who is not fit for it, and you raised him to a status which was not meant for him\. Soon Allah will take revenge against everyone who has oppressed\. They will be given food for food and drink for drink: colocynth for eating, myrrh and aloes for drinking, and fear for an inner and the sword for an outer covering\.

They are nothing but beasts of burden laden carrying sins and like camels laden with evil loads of deeds\. I swear, and again swear, that the Umayyads will have to spit out the caliphate as phlegm is spat and, thereafter, they will never taste it nor relish its flavor so long as day and night rotate\.

**Sermon 158**

**Good Conduct with People, Ignoring Their Faults**

<a id="page581"></a>I lived like a good neighbor to you and tried my best to look after you\. I freed you from the snare of humbleness and the fetters of oppression through my gratefulness for the little good \(from your side\)\. I closed my eyes to your many misdeeds which my eyes had observed and my body had witnessed\.

**Sermon 159**

**Praise of Allah**

Allah’s verdict is judicious and full of wisdom\. His Pleasure implies protection and mercy\. He decides with knowledge and forgives with forbearance\.

O Lord\! Praise to You for what You take and give, and for that from which You cure or with which You afflict\. I praise You in away which is the most acceptable to You, the most liked by You and the most dignified before You, praise which fills all Your creation and reaches where You desires, praise which is not veiled from You and does not end and whose continuity does not cease\.

**Greatness of Allah**

We do not know the reality of Your greatness except that we know that you are Ever\-living and Self\-subsisting, the One by Whom all things subsist\. Drowsiness or sleep do not overtake You; vision does not reach You and sight does not grasp You\. You see the eyes and counts the ages\. You hold \(people as slaves\) by their forelocks and feet\. We see Your creation and contemplate on it because of Your might and describe it as \(a result of\) Your great authority, whereas what is hidden from us, of which our sight has fallen short, which our intelligence has not attained and between which and ourselves curtains of the unknown have been cast, is far greater\.

He who frees his heart \(from all other engagements\) and exerts his thinking in order to know how You established Your throne, how You created Your creatures, how You suspended the air in Your skies and how You spread Your earth on the waves of water\.\.\. his eyes will return tired, his intelligence defeated, his ears eager and his thinking wandering\.

<a id="page582"></a>**Part of the Same Sermon about Hope and Fear in Allah**

One claims, according to his own thinking, that he sets his hopes on Allah\. By Allah, the Great One, he speaks a lie\. His status is that his hope \(in Allah\) does not appear through his action, although the hope of everyone who hopes is known through his own action\. Every hope is so, except the hope in Allah, the Sublime, if it is impure\. Every fear is established except the fear for Allah, if it is unreal\.

He hopes big things from Allah and small things from men, but he gives to man \(such consideration as\) he does not give to Allah\. What does he think is the matter with Allah, glorified be His praise?\! He is accorded less \(consideration\) than what is accorded to His creatures\. Do you ever fear to be false in your hope in Allah? Or do you not regard Him as the center of your hope? Similarly, if a man fears another man, he gives him \(such consideration\) out of his fear which he does not give to Allah\. Thus, he has made his fear for men ready currency, while his fear of the Creator is mere deferment or promise\. This is the case of everyone in whose eye this world appears big \(and important\) and in whose heart its status is great\. He prefers it over Allah, so he inclines towards it and becomes its devotee\.

**The Example of the Holy Prophet \(h\)**

Certainly in the Prophet of Allah \(h\) was a perfect example for

you and a proof concerning the vices of this world, its defects, themultitude of its disgraces and evils\. Because its sides had been constrained for him, while its flanks had been spread for others, he was deprived of its milk and turned away from its adornments\.

**The Example of Musa \(Moses\)**

If you want, I will, as a second example, relate to you concerning Musa, the Interlocutor of Allah \(x\), when he said, “O Allah\! I am in need

of whatever good You may grant me” \(Holy Quran, 28: 24\)\. By Allah, he asked Him only for bread to eat because he was used to eating the herbs of the earth, so much so that the greenness of the herbs could be seen from the delicate skin of his belly due to his thinness and the paucity of his flesh\.

<a id="page583"></a>**The Example of Dawud \(David\)**

If you desire, I can give you a third example of Dawud \(x\)\. He is

the holder of the Psalms and the reciter among the people of Paradise\. He used to prepare baskets of palm\-tree leaves with his own hands and would say to his companions: “Which of you will help me by purchasing it?” He used to eat barley bread \(bought\) out of its prices\.

**The Example of Aisha \(Jesus\)**

If you desire, I will tell you about Aisha \(x\) son of Maryam

\(Mary\)\. He used a stone for his pillow, put on coarse clothes and ate rough food\. His condiment was hunger\. His lamp at night was the moon\. His shade during the winter was just the expanse of earth eastward and westward\. His fruits and flowers were only what grows out of the earth for the cattle\. He had no wife to allure him, nor any son to grieve him, nor wealth to deviate \(his attention\), nor greed to disgrace him\. His two feet were his conveyance and his two hands his servant\.

**Following the Example of the Holy Prophet \(h\)**

You should follow your Prophet \(h\), the pure, the chaste, Allah

bless him and his descendants\. He is the role model for his follower and the consolation for the seeker of consolation\. The most beloved person before Allah is he who follows His Prophet \(h\) and who treads in his

footsteps\. He took the least \(share\) from this world and even then did not take a full glance at it\. Of all the people of the world he was the least satiated and the most empty of stomach\. The world was offered to him but he refused to accept it\. When he knew that Allah, the Glorified One, hated a thing, he, too, hated it\. When he knew that Allah regarded a thing as low, he, too, regarded it as low\. When he knew that Allah regarded a thing as small, he too regarded it as small\. If we love what Allah and His Prophet \(h\) hate and deem as great what Allah and His prophet hold as

small, that by itself will be enough to isolate us from Allah and a transgression against His Commands\.

The Prophet \(h\) used to eat on the ground and sit like a slave\. He

repaired his shoe with his hand and likewise patched his clothes\. He would ride an unsaddled ass and seat someone behind him\. If there was a curtain on his door with pictures on it, he would say to one of his wives, “Take it away out of my sight because if I look at it, I will then recall the

<a id="page584"></a>world and its allurements\.” Thus, he swayed his heart away from this world and destroyed its remembrance from his mind\. He loved that its allurements should remain hidden from his eyes so that he would not secure any good outfit from it, should not regard it as a place of stay and not hope to linger in it\. Consequently, he removed it from his mind, let it go away from his heart and kept it hidden from his eyes\. In the same way, he who hates a thing should hate to look at it or to hear about it\.

Certainly there was in the Prophet of Allah \(k\) all that would

warn you of the evils of this world and its defects: He remained hungry along with his main companions\. Despite his great nearness, the allurements of the world remained remote from him\. Now, one should see with one’s intelligence whether Allah honored Muhammad \(h\) as a

result of this or disgraced him\. If he says that Allah disgraced him, he certainly lies and perpetrates a great falsehood\. If he says, “Allah honored him,” he should know that Allah dishonored the others when He extended the \(benefits of the \) world for them\. Allah holds the same away from anyone who is the nearest to Him from among all men\.

Therefore, one should follow His Prophet \(h\), tread in his footsteps and do as he did; otherwise, he will not be safe from ruin\. Certainly Allah made Muhammad \(h\) a sign for the Day of Judgement, a conveyor of tidings for Paradise and a warner of retribution\. The Prophet \(k\) left this world hungry but entered upon the next world safely\. He did

not lay one stone upon another \(to make a house\) till he departed and responded to the call of Allah\. How great is Allah’s blessing in that He blessed us with the Prophet \(h\) as a predecessor whom we should follow, a leader behind whom we should all march\!

**His Own Example**

By Allah\! I have been putting patches in my shirts, so much so that now I feel shy of the patches themselves\. Someone asked me whether I should put them \[such patched garments\] away, but I said, “Get away from me\! Only in the morning do people \(realize the advantage of and\) speak highly of the night journey \[which they had undertaken\]\.”

**Sermon 160**

**Deputation of the Holy Prophet \(h\)**

<a id="page585"></a>Allah deputed the Prophet \(h\) with a glittering light, a clear

argument, an open path and a guiding Book\. His tribe is the best tribe, and his lineal tree is the best, one the branches of which are in good proportion and fruits hanging \(abundantly\)\. His birthplace was Mecca and the place of his migration Taybah \(Medna\), from where his name rose high and his voice spread far and wide\.

Allah sent him with a sufficing plea, a convincing argument and a rectifying announcement\. Through him did Allah disclose the ways that had been forsaken and destroy the innovations that had been introduced\. Through Him he explained the detailed Commandments\. Now, whoever adopts a religion other than Islam, his misery is definite, his pillar \(of support\) will be cracked, his fate will be in peril, his end will be a long grief and a distressing punishment\.

**Drawing Lessons from this World**:

I trust in Allah, the trust of bending towards Him, and I seek His guidance for the way that leads to His Paradise and takes to the place of His pleasure\. I admonish you, O servants of Allah, to fear Allah and to obey Him because doing so is salvation tomorrow and deliverance forever\. He warned \(you of chastisement\) and did so thoroughly\. He persuaded \(you towards virtues\) and did so fully\. He described this world, its cutting away from you, its decay and shifting\. Therefore, keep aloof from its attractions because very little of it will accompany you \[on your journey back to Allah\]\. This abode is the closest to the displeasure of Allah and the remotest from the pleasure of Allah\.

So close your eyes, O servants of Allah, from its worries and entanglements because you are sure about its separation and its changing conditions\. Fear it like one who sincerely fears and one who struggles hard\. Takes a lesson from what you have seen about the falling places of those before you, namely those whose their joints vanished, their eyes and ears destroyed, their honor and prestige disappeared and their pleasure and wealth came to an end\. The nearness of their children changed into remoteness\. The company of their spouses changed into separation from them\. They do not boast over each other, nor do they beget children, nor do they meet each other nor live as neighbors\. Therefore, have fear, O servants of Allah, like the fear of one who has control over himself, who can check his passions and perceive with his wisdom\. Surely, the matter is quite clear, the banner is standing, the course is level and the way is straight\.

<a id="page586"></a>

**Sermon 161**

**One of the companions of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) \(from**

**Banu Asad\) asked him: “How was it that your tribe \(Quraish\) deprived you of this status \(Caliphate\) although you deserved it most?” In his reply, the Imam said the following **:

O brother of Banu Asad\! Your girth is loose and you have put it on the wrong way\. Nevertheless, you enjoy in \-law kinship and also the right to ask\. Since you have asked, listen\. As regarding the oppression against us in this matter, although we were the highest in descent and the strongest in kinship to the Messenger of Allah, it was a selfish act over which the hearts of people became greedy, although some people did not care for it\. The Arbiter is Allah and to Him is the return on the Day of Judgement\.

Now1 leave alone this story of devastation about which there is hue and cry all around\.

Come and look at the son of Abu Sufyan \(Mu\`awiyah\) \. Time has made me laugh after weeping\. No wonder, by Allah; what is this affair which surpasses all wonder and which has increased wrongfulness? These people have tried to put out the flame of Allah’s light from His lamp and close His fountain from its source\. They mixed epidemic\-producing water between them and myself\. If the trying hardships were removed from us, I will take them on the course of truthfulness otherwise:

So let not thy self go \(in vain\) in grief for them; verily Allah knows all that they do\. \(Holy Quran, 35: 8\)

Here is an excerpt from a couplet by the famous Arab poet

Imri’ul\-Qays al\-Kindi:

\.\.\. And let me know the story of

What happened to the riding camels\!

The incident behind this couplet is that when the father of Imri’ul\-Qays, namely Hijr ibn al\-Harith, was killed, the poet roamed about the various Arab tribes to solicit their help to avenge his father’s murder\. During this endeavor, he stayed with a man of Jadilah tribe, but finding himself unsafe, he left that place and stayed with Khalid ibn Sadus an\-Nabhani\. In the meantime, a man of Jadilah named Ba’ith ibn

<a id="page587"></a>Huways took away with some of the poet’s camels\. Imri’ul\-Qays complained of this matter to his host, asking him to send with him his she\-camels, then he would get back his own\. Consequently, Khalid went to those people and asked them to return the camels of his guest which they had stolen\. They said that the poet was neither a guest \[of theirs\] nor under his \[host’s\] protection\. Thereupon, Khalid swore that the poet was really his guest, showing them his she\-camels that he had with him\. They then agreed to return the camels\. But actually instead of returning the camels, they drove away the she\-camels as well173\.

Another version of this incident is that they did return the camels to Khalid, but instead of handing them over to Imri’ul\-Qays, the host kept them for himself\. When Imri’ul\-Qays came to know this, he composed a few couplets out of which this is one\. It means “Now you leave the story of these camels which were stolen but just let me know about the she\-camels snatched from my own hands\!”

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s intention in quoting this poetry verse, as an illustration, is that “Now that Mu\`awiyah is at war, we should talk about it and leave the discussion about the devastation generated by those who had usurped my rights\. That time \[of the first calamity\] has gone away\. Now is the time for grappling with the mischief of the hour\. So discuss the event of the moment and do not start an untimely strain\.” Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said this because the man had put the

question to him at the time of the Battle of Siffin, when the battle was raging and bloodshed was in full swing\.

**Sermon 162**

**The Attributes of Allah**

Praise be to Allah, Creator of beings and things; He has spread the earth\. He makes streams flow and vegetation grow on high lands\. His primality has no beginning, nor has His eternity any end\. He is the First and forever\. He is the everlasting without limit\. Foreheads bow before Him and lips declare His Oneness\. He determined the limits of things at the time when He created them, keeping Himself away from any likeness\.

173As an editor, I apologize for admitting that I really do not know for sure what the details of the incident are\. In the absence of the original text, I could not make much sense of this paragraph, and I do not expect the reader to do any better\!

<a id="page588"></a>Imagination cannot conceive Him as having any limits of movements, or having any limbs or faculties \[such as those of His creatures\]\. It cannot be asked about Him: “Whence?” and no time limit can be attributed to Him by saying, “till then\.” He is apparent, but it cannot be asked, “from what?” He is hidden, but it cannot be asked, “in what?” He is not a body which can die, nor is He veiled so as to be enclosed\. He is not near to things by way of touch, nor is He remote from them by way of separation\.

The gazes of people’s eyes are not hidden from Him, nor the repetition of words, nor the glimpse of hillocks, nor the tread of a footstep in the dark night or in the deep gloom, where the shining moon casts its light and the effulgent sun comes in its wake, through its setting and appearing again and again with the rotation of time and periods, by the approach of the advancing night or the passing away of the fleeting day\.

He precedes every extremity and limit, every counting and numbering\. He is far above what those who attribute any limited attribute to Him, such as the qualities of measure, having extremities, living in houses and dwelling in abodes because limits are meant for creation and are attributable only to those other than Allah\.

**Allah: Originates from Nothing**

He did not create things from eternal matter nor after existing examples\. Rather, He created whatever He created then He fixed limits thereto\. He shaped whatever He shaped, ging the best shape thereto\. Nothing can disobey Him, but anyone’s obedience is of no benefit to Him\. His knowledge about those who died in the past is the same as His knowledge about the survivors\. His knowledge about whatever there is in the high skies is like His knowledge of whatever there is in the low earth\.

**Part of the Same Sermon: Creation of Mankind, the requirements of life**

O creature who has been equitably created and who has been nurtured and looked after in the darkness of wombs with multiple curtains\! You were originated from the essence of clay \(Holy Quran, 23: 12\), placed in a still place for a known length \(Holy Quran, 77: 21\-22\) and an ordained time\. You used to move in the womb of your mother as an embryo, neither responding to a call nor hearing any voice\.

<a id="page589"></a>Then you were taken out of your place of stay to a place you had not seen before and you were not acquainted with the means of awaiting its benefits, or with who guided you to eke out your sustenance from the udder of your mother\. And when you were in need, He appraised you of the location of what you required or aimed at\. Alas\! Certainly he who is unable to understand the qualities of a being with shape and limbs is more unable to understand the qualities of the Creator and the more remote from appreciating Him through the limitations\.

**Sermon 163**

**When people went to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) in a**

**deputation and complained to him about Othman, requesting him to speak to him on their behalf and to admonish him for their sake, he went to see Othman to whom he said the following : 1**

The people are behind me and they have made me an ambassador between you and themselves; but by Allah, I do not know what to say to you\. I know nothing \(in this matter\) which you do not know, nor can I lead you to any matter of which you are not aware\. You certainly know what we know\. We have not come to know anything before you which we could tell you, nor did we learn any secret which we should reveal to you\. You have seen as we have seen and you have heard as we have heard\. You sat in the company of the Prophet of Allah \(h\) as we did\. \(Abu

Bakr\) the son of AbiQuhafah as well as \(Umar\) ibn al\-Khattab were no more responsible for acting righteously than you, since you are nearer than both of them to the Prophet of Allah \(k\) through kinship and you also hold relationship to him by marriage which they do not have\.

Then \(fear\) Allah, with regard to your own self for, by Allah, you are not being shown anything as if you are blind or being apprised of anything as if you are ignorant\. Everything is clear while the banners of faith are fixed\. You should know that among the servants of Allah, the most distinguished person before Allah is the just imam who has been guided \(by Allah\) and who guides others\. So, he stands by the recognized ways of the Prophet’s behavior and destroys unrecognized innovations\. The \(Prophet’s\) ways are clear and they have signs, while innovations are also clear and they, too, have signs\. Certainly, the worst man before Allah is the oppressive imam who has gone astray and through whom others go astray\. He destroys the accepted Sunnah and revives abandoned innovations\. I heard the Messenger of Allah saying: “On the Day of Judgement, the oppressive imam will be brought with none to support him

<a id="page590"></a>or to advance excuses on his behalf\. Then he will be thrown into Hell where he will rotate as the hand\-mill rotates, then \(eventually\) he will be confined to its hollow\.

I swear to you by Allah that you should not be such an imam of the people who will be killed because it has been said that an imam of this people will be killed after which killing and fighting will be made open for them till the Day of Judgement and he will confuse their matters and spread troubles over them\. As a result, they will not distinguish right from wrong\. They will oscillate like waves and will be utterly misled\. You should not behave as the beast of burden for Marwan \[ibn al\-Hakam, your cousin\] so that he may drag you wherever he likes, despite \(your\) seniority of age and length of life\.

It was then that Othman said the following to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\): “Ask the people to give me time till I redress their grievances\.” Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said, “As far as Medina is concerned, time is

out of the question\. As for more remote areas, you can have the time needed for your order to reach your objectives\.”

During the Caliphate of Othman, the Muslims were weary of the oppression of the Government\. Its officials gathered in Medina to complain to the senior companions of the Prophet \(h\)\. They came to

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) in a peaceful manner and requested him to

see Othman and advise him not to trample on the Muslims’ rights and to put an end to the troubles which were proving to be the cause of the people’s ruin\. It was then that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) went to him and spoke those words\.

In order to make the bitterness of the admonition palatable, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) adopted that way of speech in the beginning which

will create a sense of responsibility in the addressee and direct him towards his obligations\. Thus, by referring to his being a companion of the Prophet \(h\), his personal status and kinship to the Prophet \(h\) as

compared with the two caliphs who preceded him, his intention was to make him realize his duties\. At any rate, this was obviously not an occasion for eulogizing him, so its latter portion can be disregarded and the whole speech be regarded as a praise of his accomplishments because from its very beginning, it is evident that whatever Othman did, he did it wilfully, that nothing was done without his knowledge or his being

<a id="page591"></a>informed, and that he could not be held unaccountable for it because of his being unaware of it\.

If the adoption of a line of action which made the whole Islamic world raise hue and cry in spite of his having being a companion of the Prophet \(h\), having heard his instructions, having seen his behavior and

having been acquainted with the commandments of Islam, can be regarded as a distinction, then this taunt may also be regarded as a praise\. If that is not a distinction, then this, too, cannot be called a praise\. In fact, the words about which it is argued, i\.e\. that they are complimentary, are enough to prove the seriousness of his crime because a crime in ignorance and unawareness is not so serious as the one carrying the weight given to the seriousness of the commission of a crime despite one’s knowledge and awareness\. Consequently, a person who is unaware of the rise and fall of a road and stumbles in the dark night is to be excused, but a person who is aware of the rise and fall of the road, so he stumbled in broad day light, is liable to be blamed\. If, on this occasion, he is told that he has eyes and is also aware of the rise and fall of the way, it will not mean that his vastness of knowledge or the brightness of his eyesight is being praised, but the intention will be that he did not notice the pitfalls despite his eyes and did not walk properly\. For him, therefore, having or not having eyes is the same and knowing is equal to not knowing at all\.

In this regard, a great emphasis is placed on his being a son\-in\-law of the Prophet \(h\), having married two of daughters, namely Ruqayya and Umm Kulthum, one after the other174

Before taking this to be a distinction, the real nature of Othman as the Prophet’s son\-in\-law should be scrutinized\. History shows that in this matter Othman did not enjoy the distinction of being the first \[to marry them\]\. Before him, Ruqayya and Umm Kulthum had been married to two sons of Abu Lahab, namely Utbah and Utaybah \[who is condemned in the Holy Quran\]\. Yet despite their being sons\- in\-law, they were not been included among the people of prestige during the time preceding the dawn of Prophethood\. How, then, can this be regarded as a source of distincion without any personal merit, when there is no authority about the importance of this relationship, nor was any importance attached to this matter in such a way that there might have been some competition

174Many historians assert that both Ruqayya and Umm Kulthum were daughters of Khadija, the Prophet’s first wife, by her second husband, Ateeq ibn \`Aaith of Banu Makhzum\. Both ladies, therefore, were not daughters of the Prophet \(k\) but his step\-daughters\.

<a id="page592"></a>between Othman and some other important personality in this regard and that his selection for it might have given him prominence, or that the two ladies might have been shown to possess an important status in history, tradition or biography as a result of which this relationship could be given a special importance and regarded as a cause of one’s distinction?\! If the marriage of these two daughters to Utbah and Utaybah during the period of jahiliyya is held as lawful on the ground that marriage with the unbelievers had not till then been made unlawful, then in Othman’s case, the condition for lawfulness was his acceptance of Islam\. There is no doubt that he had pronounced the Kalima \(ash\-shahadatayn: “There is no god but Allah and Muhammad \(h\) is His Messenger”\) and had accepted

Islam publicly\. As such, this marriage can be held a proof of his acceptance of Islam\. But no other honor can be proved through it\. Again, it is also not agreed upon that these two ladies were the real daughters of the Messenger of Allah because there is one group \[of historians\] which disproves their being the Prophet’s real daughters, tracing their descent as the daughters of Khadija’s sister, Halah, or her daughters by her own previous \[second\] husband\. Thus, Abul\-Qasim al\-Kufi \(d\. 352 A\.H\.\) writes the following:\.

“Some time prior to the Messenger of Allah \(k\) marrying

Khadija, \[Abu\] Halah \[second husband of Khadija\] died, leaving two daughters, one named Zainab and the other named Ruqayyah\. Both of the latter were \[later\] raised by the Prophet \(h\) and Khadija, looking after

them as it was the custom before Islam when a child was assigned to whoever brought him up” \(Al\-Istighatha, p\.69\)\.

Ibn Hisham has written the following about the issues of Hadrat Khadija:\.

“Before her marriage to the Prophet \(h\), she was married to Abu

Halah ibn Malik\. She delivered for him Hind, son of Abu Halah, and Zainab, daughter of Abu Halah\. Before her marriage to Abu Halah, she had been married to \`Utayyiq \[or \`Ateeq according to other references\] ibn Abid ibn Abdillah ibn Amr ibn Makhzum and she delivered for him Abdullah and a daughter” \(Al\-Sira al\-Nabawiyya, Vol\. 4, p\. 293\)\.

This prove that Hadrat Khadija had two daughters before being married to the Prophet \(h\)\. According to all evidences, they will be

called his “daughters” and those to whom they were married will be called his “sons\-in\-law,” but the status of this relationship will be the same as if those girls were his daughters\. Therefore, before putting it forth

<a id="page593"></a>as a matter of pride, the real status of the daughters should be noted and a glance should be cast at Othman’s conduct\. In this regard, al\-Bukhari and other narrators \(of traditions\) as well as historians record this tradition as follows:\.

Anas ibn Malik relates that: “We were present on the occasion of the burial of the Prophet’s daughter Umm Kulthum\. While the Prophet \(h\) was sitting beside her grave, I saw his eyes shedding tears\. Then he said, ‘Is there anyone among you who has not committed a sin last night?’ Abu Talhah \(Zayd ibn Sahl al\-Ansari\) said, ‘I’ The Prophet \(h\) said, ‘Then you get into the grave\.’ He got down into the grave\.”

The commentators said that by “committed a sin”, the Holy Prophet \(h\) meant to say “anyone who had not had sexual intercourse\.”175

On this occasion, the Holy Prophet \(h\) unveiled the private life

of Othman and prevented him from getting down into the grave, although it was a prominent merit of the Prophet’s character that he did not disgrace or belittle anyone by publicly exposing his private life and despite his knowledge of others’ shortcomings which he ignored\. But in this case, the filth was such that it was deemed necessary to disgrace him before the whole crowd\.

Since Othman did not show any regard for the demise of his wife \(Umm Kulthum\), nor was he moved or felt sorry \(for this event\), thus paying no heed to severing his relationship with the Holy Prophet \(h\) \(for being his son\-in\-law\), he \(Othman\) had a sexual intercourse on the same night; therefore, the Holy Prophet \(h\) deprived him of this right

and honor\. For more details, refer to: al\-Bukhari, Sahih, Vol\. 2, pp\. 100\-101, 114; Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Al\- Musnad, Vol\. 3, pp\. 126, 228, 229, 270; al\-Hakim, Al\- Mustadrak, Vol\. 4, p\. 47; al\-Bayhaqi, Al\-Sunan al\-Kubra, Vol\. 4, p\. 53; Ibn Sa\`d, Al\-Tabaqat al\-Kubra, Vol\. 8, p\. 26; as\-Suhayli, Al\-Rawd al\-Anif, Vol\. 2, p\. 107; Ibn Hajar, Al\-Isaba, Vol\. 4, p\. 489; Fath al\-Bari, Vol\. 3, p\. 122; al\-Ayni, \`Umdat al\-Qari, Vol\. 4, p\. 85; Ibn al\-Athir, Al \-Nihaya, Vol\. 3, p\. 276; Ibn Manzur, Lisan al\-\`Arab, Vol\. 9, pp\. 280\-281; az\-Zabidi, Taj al\-Arus, Vol\. 6, p\. 220\.

175Is committing any sexual intercourse a sin?\! Not at all if it is with one’s own wife; it will be regarded as a good deed as we are told in _hadith_\. But such is the text we have to work with\. As an editor, I had to work with this text without the good fortune of comparing it with the original Arabic text\.

**Sermon 164**

**Describing the Wonderful Creation of the Peacock, the Wonderful Creation of Birds**

Allah has provided wonderful creations including the living, the lifeless, the stationary and the moving\. He has established such clear proofs for His delicate creative power and great might that minds bend down to Him in acknowledgment thereof and in submission to Him and arguments about His oneness strike our ears\. He has created birds of various shapes which live in the burrows of the earth, in the openings of high passes and on mountain peaks\.

They have different kinds of wings and various characteristics\. They are controlled by the rein of \(Allah’s\) authority\. They flutter with their wings in the expanse of the vast firmament and the open atmosphere\. He brought them into existence from non \-existence in strange external shapes and composed them with joints and bones covered with flesh\. He prevented some of them from flying easily in the sky because of their heavy bodies and allowed them to use their wings only close to the ground\. He has set them in different colors by His delicate might and exquisite creative power\.

Among them are those which are tinted with one hue and there is no other hue except the one in which they have been dyed\. There are others which are tinted with one color and they have a neck ring of a different color than that with which they are tinted\.

**About the Peacock**

The most amazing among them in its creation is the peacock which Allah has created in the most symmetrical dimensions and arranged its hues in the best arrangement with wings the ends of which are inter\-weaved together and with a long tail\. When it approaches its female, it spreads out its folded tail and raises it up so as to cast a shade over its head, as if it were the sail of a boat being pulled by the sailor\. It feels proud of its colors and sways with its movements\. It copulates like the cocks\. It leaps \(on the female\) for cohabitation like lustful energetic men at the time of fighting\.

I am telling you all this from observation, unlike he who narrates on the basis of a weak authority\. For example, it is the belief of some

<a id="page595"></a>people that it cohabits with the female by a tear which flows from its eyes\. When it stops on the edges of the eyelids, the female swallows it and lays its eggs thereby, not through cohabitation by a male other than by means of this flowing tear\. Even if they say this, it will be no more amazing than \(what they say about\) the mutual feeding of the crows \(prior to cohabitation\)\. You will imagine its feathers to be like sticks made of silver and the wonderful circles and sun\-shaped feathers growing there to be of pure gold and pieces of green emerald\. If you likened them to anything growing on land, you will say that it is a bouquet of flowers collected during every spring\. If you likened them to clothes, they will be like printed apparels or amazing variegated clothes of Yemen\. If you likened them to ornaments, then they will be like gems of different color with studded silver\.

The peacock walks with vanity and pride, throwing open its tail and wings, laughing, admiring the handsomeness of its outfit and the hues of its necklace of gems\. But when it casts its glance at its legs, it cries loudly with a voice which indicates its call for help, displaying its true grief because its legs are thin like the legs of Indo \-Persian cross \-bred cocks\. At the end of its shin, there is a thin thorn, and on the crown of its head, there is a bunch of green variegated feathers\. Its neck begins in the shape of a goblet and it stretches up to its belly like the hair\-dye of Yemen in color or like silk cloth put on a polished mirror which looks as if it has been covered with a black veil\. Other than that, on account of its excessive luster and extreme brightness, it appears that a lush green color has been mixed with it\. Along the openings of its ears there is a line of shining bright daisy color like the thin end of a pen\. Whiteness shines on the black background\. There is hardly a hue from which it has not taken a bit and improved it further by regular polish, luster, silken brightness and brilliance\. It is, therefore, like scattered blossoms which have not been seasoned by the rains of spring or the summer sun\.

It also sheds its plumage and puts off its outfit\. They all fall away and grow again\. They fall away from the feather stems like the falling of leaves from twigs, then they begin to join together and grow till they return to the state that existed before their falling away\. The new hues do not change from the previous ones, nor does any color occur anywhere other than in its own place\. If you carefully look at one hair from the hairs of its feather stems, it will look like a red rose, then like emerald green, then like golden yellow\.

How can sharpness of intellect describe such a creation, or faculty of mind, or the utterances of describers manage to tell of it? Even its

<a id="page596"></a>smallest parts have made it impossible for the imagination to pick them out or for tongues to describe them\. Glorified is Allah Who has disabled intellects from describing the creation which He placed openly before the eyes and which they see bounded, shaped, arranged and colored\. He also disabled tongues from briefly describing its qualities and also from expanding in its praise\.

**The magnificence of the Creator in Great and Small Creations**

Glorified is Allah Who has assigned feet to small ants and gnats and also to those above them, the serpents and the elephants\. He has made it obligatory upon Himself that no skeleton in which He infuses a spirit will move, but that death is its promised place and destruction its final end\.

**Part of the Same Sermon: Describing Paradise**

If you cast your mind’s eye at what is described to you about Paradise, your heart will begin to hate the delicacies of this world that have been displayed here, namely its desires and its pleasures and the beauties of its scenes\. And you will be lost in the rustling of the trees whose roots lie hidden in the mounds of musk on the banks of the rivers in Paradise and in the attraction of the bunches of fresh pearls on the twigs and branches of those trees and in the appearance of different fruits from under the cover of their leaves\. These fruits can be picked without difficulty as they come down at the desire of their pickers\. Pure honey and fermented wine will be handed round to those who settle down in the courtyards of its palaces\.

They are a people whom honor has always followed till they were made to settle in the house of eternal abode, and they obtained rest from the movement of journeying\. O listener\! If you busy yourself in advancing towards these wonderful scenes which will rush towards you, then your heart will certainly die due to eagerness for them, and you will be prepared to seek the company of those in the graves, straight away from my audience here, and hasten towards them\. May Allah, through His mercy, include us and yourselves, too, among those who strive with their hearts for the abodes of the virtuous\.

<a id="page597"></a>**Note explaining some of the wonderful and obscure portions of this sermon:**\.

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “In the words of Imam Ali ibn

Abu Talib \(x\): ‘Aya’urru bimalaqihihi, ‘al\-arr’ implies copulation, e\.g\.

When it is said, ‘arra’r\-rajulu al\-mar’ata ya’urruha,’ it means ‘He copulated with the woman\.’”

In his words “Aka’annahu qal’u dariyyin anajahu nutiyyuhu, al\-qal,” he means the sail of a boat\. “Dari” means belonging to Darin, a small town on the coast from where scents are bought\. And “anajahu” means Aturned it\. It is said, “anajtun’n\-naqata” like “nasartu \- a’najuha anjan” when you turn the she\-camel\. And “an\-nuti” means “sailor”\. His words “daffatay jufunihi” mean: edges of the eyelids, since “ad\-daffatan” means: The two edges\. As for his words “wa filadhu’z\-zabarjadi,” “al\-filadh” is the plural of “al\-fildhah”; it means “piece”\. His words “ka ba’isi’l\-lulu’i’r\-ratibi”: “al\- kibasah” means “bunch of dates”\. “Al\-\`asalij” means twigs\. Its singular is “\`Usluj”\.

**Sermon 165**

**Advice for Observing Courtesy and Kindness and Keeping in and out of the Same**

The young among you should follow the elders while the elders should be kind to the young\. Do not be like those rude people of the pre\-Islamic \(al\-jahiliyyah\) period who did not exert themselves in religion nor use their intellects in the matter of Allah\. They1 are like the breaking of eggs in the nest of a dangerous bird because their breaking looks bad, but keeping them intact will mean the production of dangerous young ones\.

**Part of the same sermon about the autocracy and oppression of the Umayyads and their fate**

They will divide after their unity and scatter away from their nucleus\. Some of them will stick to the branches and bend down as the branches bend, until Allah, the Sublime, will gather them together for the Day that will be the very worst for the Umayyads just as the scattered bits of clouds assemble in the autumn\. Allah will create affinity among them\. Then He will make them into a strong mass like the mass of clouds\. Then He will open doors for them to flow out of their starting place like the flood of the two gardens \(of Saba’\) from which neither high rocks

<a id="page598"></a>remained safe nor small hillocks\. Its flow could be repulsed neither by strong mountains nor by high lands\. Allah will scatter them in the low lands of valleys, then will He make them flow like streams throughout the earth\. Through them He will arrange the taking of rights of one people by another people and make one people stay in the houses of those of other people’s\. By Allah, all their status and esteem will dissolve as fat dissolves on the fire\.

**The Cause of Tyranny**

O people\! If you had not evaded support for the truth and had not felt weakness from crushing wrong, then he who does not match you will not have aimed at you, and he who over\-powered you will not have over\-powered you\. But you roamed about the deserts \(of disobedience\) like Banu Isra’il \(Children of Israel\)\. I swear by my life that after me your tribulations will increase manifold because you will have abandoned the truth behind your backs, severed your ties with your near ones and established relations with remote ones\. Be informed that if you had followed the one who was calling you \(to guidance\), he will have let you tread the ways of the Prophet \(h\), then you will have been spared the

difficulties of misguidance, and you will have thrown away the crushing burden from round your necks\.

The implication here is that the fake type of Islam of these people required that they should not be assaulted, but the consequence of sparing them in this way was that they would create mischief and rebellion\.

**Sermon 166**

**Delivered at the Inception of his Caliphate**

Fulfillment of rights and obligations and advice to fear Allah in all matters:

Allah, the One Glorified by all, has revealed \[for you\] a Book of guidance wherein He has explained virtue and vice\. You should adopt the course of virtue whereby you will have guidance and keep aloof from the path of vice so that you may remain on the right path\. \(Mind\) the obligations, \(mind\) the obligations\! Fulfil them for the sake of pleasing Allah and they will take you to Paradise\. Surely, Allah has made unlawful the things which are not unknown and made lawful the things which are without defect\. He has declared paying regard to Muslims as the highest

<a id="page599"></a>of all regards\. He has placed the rights of Muslims in the same level \(of importance\) as devotion \(to Him and to His oneness\)\. Therefore, a Muslim is one from whose tongue and hand every \(other\) Muslim is safe except in the matter relevant to the truth\. It is not, therefore, lawful to assault a Muslim except when it is obligatory\.

Hasten towards the most common matter which is peculiar to everyone, and it is death\. Certainly, people \(who have already gone\) are ahead of you while the hour \(Day of Judgement\) is driving you from behind\. Remain light, in order that you may overtake them\. Your backs are being protected for the sake of protecting the fronts\. Fear Allah in the matter of His creatures and His cities because you will be questioned even about lands and beasts\. Obey Allah and do not disobey Him\. When you witness virtue \(being done\) adopt it, and when you witness vice \(being committed\) avoid it\.

**Sermon 167**

**Having sworn allegiance to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), some people from among the companions of the Prophet \(h\) said to him\.**

**“You should punish the people who assaulted Othman,” whereupon he said the following :**

O Brethren\! I am not ignorant of what you know, but how do I have the power for it while those who assaulted him are in the height of their power? They have superiority over us, not we over them\. They are now in the status that even your slaves have risen with them and bedouin Arabs, too, have joined them\. They are now among you and are harming you as they please\. Do you see any way to be able to do what you aim at?

This demand is certainly that of the pre\-Islamic \(jahiliyya\) period, and these folks have support behind them\. When the matter is taken up, people will have different views about it\. One group will think as you do, but another will not think as you think, and there will be still another group that will be neither this way nor that\. Be patient till people quiet down and hearts settle in their places so that rights can be achieved for people easily\. Rest assured from me and see what is given to you by me\. Do not do anything which shatters your power, weakens your strength and engenders feebleness and disgrace\. I shall control this affair as far as possible, but if I find it necessary, the last treatment will, of course, be branding with a hot iron \(through fighting\)\.

<a id="page600"></a>

**Sermon 168**

**When the people of Jamal set out for Basra, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said the following :**\.

There is no doubt that Allah sent down the Prophet \(h\) as a

guide with an eloquent Book and a standing command\. No one will be ruined by it except one who ruins his own self\. Certainly, only doubtful innovations cause ruin except those from which Allah may protect you\. In Allah’s authority lies the safety of your affairs\. Therefore, render Him such obedience as is neither blameworthy nor insincere\. By Allah, you must do so; otherwise, Allah will take away from you the power of Islam and will never thereafter return it to you till it reverts to others\.

Certainly, these people are in agreement in disliking my authority\. I will carry on till I perceive disunity among you because if they succeed in spite of the unsoundness of their view, the whole organization of the Muslims will be shattered\. They are hankering after this world out of jealousy against him on whom Allah has bestowed it\. So they intend to revert the matters on their backs \(return to the pre \-Islamic period\), while on us it is obligatory, for your sake, to abide by the Book of Allah \(Holy Quran\), the Sublime and the conduct of the Prophet of Allah \(k\), to stand by His rights and to revive his Sunnah\.

**Sermon 169**

**When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) approached Basra, a**

**bedouin met him and spoke to him, as he had been sent to him by a group of people of Basra to inquire from him on their behalf his status vis\-a\-vis the people of Jamal\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) explained to him his status with regard to them\. From it, he became convinced that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) was on the right track\.**

**Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) asked him to swear the oath of allegiance**

**to him, but he replied, “I am just a messenger of people and shall not do anything till I get back to them\. Upon this, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said to him the following:**

“If those whom you left behind send you as a forerunner to search out a rain\-fed area for them, and you return to them and appraise them of greenery and water, but they disagree with you and go towards dry and

<a id="page601"></a>barren land, what will you do then?” The man said, “I will leave them and go towards greenery and water\.” Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) then said,

“So, then, stretch your hand\!” This man related later saying, “By Allah\! By such a clear argument, I could not refrain from swearing allegiance to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\.

This man was known as Kulayb al\-Jarmi\.

**Sermon 170**

**When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) decided to fight the enemy face\-to\-face at Siffin he said the following: **\.

“O Lord\! O Sustainer of the high sky, Suspender of the firmament which You have made a shelter for the night and the day, an orbit for the sun and the moon and a path for the rotating stars and for populating it\! You have created a group of Your angels who do not get weary of worshipping You\. O Sustainer of this earth which You have made an abode for people and a place for the movement of insects, beasts and countless other creatures, seen and unseen\! O Sustainer of strong mountains which You have made as pegs for the earth and \(a means of\) support for people\! Grant us victory over our enemy, O Lord, save us from excesses and keep us on the straight path of truth\! But if You grant them victory over us, then grant us martyrdom and save us from mischief\.

Where are those who protect honor and those self\-respecting persons who defend respectable people in the time of hardship? Shame is behind you while Paradise is in front of you\.

**Sermon 171**

**About the Consultative Committee and the Battle of Jamal**

Praise be to Allah from Whose view one sky does not conceal another sky nor one earth another earth\!

**Part of the same sermon: About the “Consultative**

**Committee” After the Death of \`Umar ibn al\-Khattab**:

<a id="page602"></a>Someone176 said to me, “O son of Abu Talib\! You covet the caliphate\.” I said to him, “Rather, you are, by Allah, more greedy, although more remote from it, while I am more suited as well as nearer\. I have demanded it as my right, while you are intervening between me and it and you are turning my face from it\.” When I knocked at his ears with arguments among the crowd of those present he was startled as if he was stunned not knowing what reply to give me about it\.

O Lord\! I seek Your succor against the tribesmen of Quraish and those who are assisting them because they are denying me \(the rights of\) kinship, have lowered my high status and are united in opposing me in the matter \(of the caliphate\) which is my right then they said, “Be informed that the rightful thing is that you have it and also that you may leave it\.”177

“They \(the tribesmen of Quraish and those who are assisting them\) were not only content to keep me away from my right over the

176During the incident of the Consultative Committee, Sa\`d ibn Abu Waqqas repeated to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) what \`Umar had said in his last hours, that is, that “O Ali\! You are very greedy for the status of Caliphate\.” Ali \(x\) replied: “He who demands his own right cannot be called greedy; rather,

greedy is he who prevents the securing of ones right and tries to grab it despite being unfit for it\.”

There is no doubt that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) considered the

Caliphate to be his right and demanded it\. The demand for one’s right does not dispel a right so that it may be put forth as an excuse for not assigning him the caliphate, and the demand may be held as a sign of greed\. Even if it was greed, who was not involved in this greed? Was not the pull between the Muhajirun and the Ansar, the mutual struggle between the members of the “Consultative Committee” and the mischief mongering of Talhah and az\-Zubayr the product of this very greed? If Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had been greedy for this status,

he would have stood for it regardless of tis consequences and outcomes\. When Abbas \(uncle of the Prophet \[h\]\) and Abu Sufyan pressed him to \(accept to

swear the oath of\) allegiance, and when, after the third Caliph, people thronged to him for \(swearing\) allegiance, he had to accept their offer regardless of the deteriorated conditions\. But at no time did Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) take any

step which indicated that he wanted the Caliphate for the sake of caliphate\. Rather, his demand for the caliphate was only with the objective that its aspects should not be altered, and the religion should not become the victim of others’ desires, not that he should enjoy the pleasures of life which could be attributed to greed\.

177Explaining the meaning, Ibn Abul\-Hadid writes that Imam Ali ibn

Abu Talib’s intention was to say:

<a id="page603"></a>caliphate which they have usurped \(from me\), but rather claimed that it was their right whether to give it to me or prevent me from the same, and that I have no right to argue with them\.”Furthermore, the intention \(of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\) was as follows: “Had they not said that it

was right to keep away from the caliphate, it would have been easy to endure it\. This is so because this will have, at least, showed their admitting my right although they were not prepared to concede it” \(Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 9, p\. 306\)\.

**Part of the Same Sermon: Describing the People of Jamal**

They \(Talhah, az\-Zubayr and their supporters\) came out dragging the wife of the Messenger of Allah \(Aisha\) just as a bondmaid is dragged for sale\. They took her to Basra where those two \(Talhah and az\-Zubayr\) put their own women in their houses while exposing the wife of the Messenger of Allah to themselves and to others in the army in which there was not a single individual who had not pledged his obedience and sworn to me allegiance quite willingly, without any compulsion\.

Here in Basra, they approached my Governor and coffers of the public treasury, the funds of its other inhabitants\. They killed some of them in captivity as well as others in treachery\. By Allah, even if they had willfully killed only one individual from among the Muslims without any fault, it will have been lawful for me to kill all of this army because they were present in it but did not disagree with it nor prevented it by tongue or hand, not to say that they killed from among the Muslims a number equal to that with which they had marched on them\.

**Sermon 172**

**On the Eligibility for Caliphate**

The Prophet \(h\) is the trustee of Allah’s revelation, the Last of

His Prophets, the giver of tidings of His mercy and the warner of His chastisement\.

O people\! The most rightful of all persons for this matter \(the caliphate\) is he who is most competent among them to maintain it and he who best knows Allah’s commands in its regard\. If any mischief is created by a mischief\-monger, he will be called upon to repent\. If he refuses, he will be fought\. By my life, if the question of Imamate was not to be decided unless all the people were present, then there would be no

<a id="page604"></a>such case\. But those who agreed about it imposed the decision on those who were absent, so much so that he who was present could not dissent, and the one who was absent could not choose \(any one else\)\. Be informed that I shall fight two persons: one who claims what is not his, and the other who ignores what is obligatory upon him\.

**The Need for Wisdom in Fighting Against Muslims**

O servants of Allah\! I admonish you to fear Allah because it is the best advice to be mutually given by persons and the best of all things before Allah\. The door of war has been opened between you and the other Muslims\. And this banner will be borne only by him who is a man of foresight, of endurance, and of knowing the status of rightfulness\. Therefore, you should go ahead with that whereby you are ordered and desist from what you are required to refrain\. Do not make haste in any matter till you have clarified it\. In the case of every matter which you dislike, we have the right to change it\.

**The Behavior of this World with those who Cling to it**

Be informed that this world which you have started to covet, and in which you are interested, and which sometimes enrages you and sometimes pleases you, is not your \(permanent\) abode, nor is it the place of your stay for which you might have been created, nor is it the one to which you have been invited\. Be informed that it will not last for you, nor will you live along with it\. If anything out of this world deceives you \(i\.e\. attracts you\), its own evils warn you, too\. You should give up \(the objects of\) its deceit in favor of \(the objects of\) its warning and \(the objects of\) its attraction in favor of \(the objects of\) its horrors\. And while being in it, advance towards that house to which you have been called and turn your hearts away from the world\. None of you should cry like a bondmaid over anything which she has been deprived of\. Seek the perfection of Allah’s bounty over you through endurance in obeying Allah and in safeguarding what He has asked you to safeguard, namely His Book\.

Be informed that the loss of anything of this world will not harm you so long as you have guarded the principles of your religion\. Know also that after the loss of your religion, nothing of this world, for which you have cared, will ever benefit you\. May Allah carry our hearts and yours towards what is right, and may He grant you and ourselves endurance\.

<a id="page605"></a>When the people collected in the saqifa of Banu Sa’idah in connection with the election, even those who were not present there were made to follow the decision taken the re\. And the principle was adopted that those present at the election had no right to reconsider the matter or to break the allegiance and those not present could do nothing but acquiesce in the agreed decision\. But when the people of Medna swore allegiance at the hands of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), the Governor of Syria

\(Mu\`awiyah\) refused to follow suit on the ground that since he was not present on the occasion he was not bound to abide by it, whereupon Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) replied in this sermon on the basis of these accepted

and agreed principles and conditions which had been established among these people and had become unable to convert\. AWhen the people of Medna and the Ansar and the Muhajirun have sworn allegiance on my hand, Mu\`awiyah had no right to keep aloof from it on the ground that he was not present on the occasion, nor were Talhah and az\-Zubayr entitled to break the pledge after swearing allegiance\.

On this occasion, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) did not argue on the strength of any saying of the Prophet \(h\) which will serve as his final

say about the caliphate because the grounds for refusal in his case was with regard to the modus operandi of the principle of election\. Therefore, in keeping with the requirements of the situation a reply based on the agreed principles of the adversary could alone quiet him\. Even if he had argued on the strength of the Prophet’s command it will have been subjected to various interpretations and the matter will have been prolonged instead of being settled\. Again Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had

seen that soon after the death of the Prophet \(h\) all his sayings and

commands had been set aside\. Therefore, how after the lapse of a long time, could one be expected to accept it when habit had been established to follow one’s free will against the Prophet’s sayings\.

**Sermon 173**

**About Talhah ibn Ubaydillah**

\(Delivered when he received the news that Talhah and az\-Zubayr had already left for Basra to fight him\):

As far as I am concerned, I will never be too afraid to fight or to initiate a battle because I am satisfied with the promise of Allah’s support for me\. By Allah, Talhah has hastened with an oath to avenge Othman’s

<a id="page606"></a>murder fearing lest the demand for Othman’s blood be made against his own self\. This is so because the people’s idea in this matter is about him and, in fact, he was the most anxious among them for killing Othman \. Therefore, he has tried to create a misunderstanding by collecting forces in order to confuse the matter and to create doubt\.

By Allah, he did not act in either of three ways about Othman: If the son of Affan \(Othman\) was wrong, as Talhah believed, it is necessary for him to support those who killed178 him or to keep away from his supporters\. If Othman was the victim of oppression, then Talhah should have been among those who were keeping \(the assailants\) away from him or were advancing pleas on his behalf\. If he was in doubt about these two alternatives, then it was incumbent upon him to leave him \(Othman\) and to retire, to leave the men with him\. But he adopted none of these three ways and came out with a thing in which there is nothing good and his excuses are not acceptable\.

**Sermon 174**

**Warning Neglectful People; the Vastness of His Knowledge**

O people who are \(negligent of Allah but\) not neglected \(by Allah\) and those who miss \(doing good deeds\) but are to be caught\! How is it that I see you becoming distanced from Allah and becoming interested in others? You are like the camel whom the shepherd drives to a disease\-stricken pasture and a disastrous watering place\. They are like animals who are fed in order to be slaughtered, but they do not know what is intended for them\. When they are treated well, they consider that day to be their whole life and eating to their fill as their aim\.

By Allah, if I wish, I can tell everyone of you from where he has come, where he has to go and all his affairs\. But I fear lest you \(in such case\) should abandon the Messenger of Allah \(k\) in my favor\. I shall certainly convey these things to the selected ones who will remain safe from such a dreadful thing\. By Allah Who deputed the Prophet \(h\) with

178The Imam here means to say that if Talhah considered Othman an oppressor, then after his assassination, instead of getting ready to avenge his blood, he should have supported his killers and justified their action\. It is not the intention that in the case of \`Othman being wrong that Talhah should have supported the attackers because he was already supporting and encouraging them\.

<a id="page607"></a>the truth and distinguished him over all creation, I do not speak save the truth\. He \(the Prophet \(h\)\) informed me of all this and also of the death

of everyone who dies, the salvation of everyone who is granted salvation and the consequences of this matter \(the caliphate\)\. He left nothing \(that could\) pass into my head without putting it in my ear and telling me about it\.

O people\! By Allah, I do not impel you to any obedience unless I practice it before you, nor do I restrain you from any disobedience unless I desist from it before you\.

Those who drink from the springs of revelation and the Divine inspiration are able to see things that are hidden behind the curtains, things of the unknown, and the events which will occur in the future\. They do so in the same way as objects are seen with the eyes\. This does not contradict with the following statement of Allah: “Say: ‘None \(either\) in the heavens or in the earth knows the unseen save Allah’” \(Holy Quran,

1. 65\) because this verse contains the negation of personal knowledge of the unknown, but not the negation of knowledge which is required by the prophets and holy persons through the Divine inspiration by virtue of which they make prophecies about the future and unveil many events and happenings\. Several verses of the Holy Quran support this view such as:\.

“When the Prophet \(h\) confided a matter to one of his wives, she

divulged it \(to others\) and Allah informed him of it\. He revealed a part of it and avoided a part\. So, when he informed her of it, said she: ‘Who informed you of this?’ He said, “The All\-knowing, the All\-aware informed me’” \(Holy Quran, 66: 3\)\.

“These are of the tidings of the unseen which We reveal to you \(O Our Prophet Muhammad\)\.\.\.”\(Holy Quran, 11: 49\)\.

It is, therefore, wrong to argue in support for the view that if it is said that the prophets and holy persons possess knowledge of the unknown, this will imply duality with regard to the Divine attributes\. It will have implied duality if it were said that someone other than Allah has personal knowledge of the unknown\. When it is not so, and the knowledge of the Prophets and Imams is given by Allah, it has no connection with duality\. If duality should mean what is alleged, what will be the status of Isa’s \(Jesus’s\) assertion related thus in the Holy Qurany:

<a id="page608"></a>“\.\.\. \.Out of clay will I make for you like the figure of a bird, and I will breathe into it and it shall become a flying bird by Allah’s permission, and I shall heal the blind and the leper and will cause the dead to rise to life by Allah’s permission, and I will declare to you what you eat and what you store in you houses” \(Holy Quran, 3: 49\)\.

If it is believed that Aisha \(Jesus\) could create and bestow life with Allah’s permission, does this mean that he was Allah’s partner in the attributes of creation and revival? If this is not so, then how can it be said that if Allah gives someone the knowledge of the unknown, it implies that he has been taken him to be His partner in His attributes? And how can anyone extol one’s belief in the Oneness of Allah by holding that the knowledge of the unknown implies duality?

No one can deny the fact that some people either see in dreams certain things which have yet to occur in the future, or that things can be read through interpretation of the dream, while during a dream neither do the senses function nor do the powers of understanding and comprehension operate\. Therefore, if some events become known to some people while being awake, why should there be amazement over it, and what are the grounds for rejecting it when it stands to reason that things possible in dreams are also possible in wakefulness? Thus, Ibn Maytham al\-Bahrani has written that it is possible to achieve all this because in a dream the spirit becomes free from looking after the body and is removed from bodily connections\. As a result of this, it perceives such hidden realities which could not be seen because of the obstruction of the body\. In the same way, those perfect beings who pay no heed to bodily matters and turn with all the attention of spirit and heart towards the center of knowledge can see those realities and secrets which the ordinary eyes are unable to discern\. Therefore, keeping in view the spiritual greatness of Ahl al\-Bayt \(x\), it should not appear strange that they were aware of

events which were going to occur in the future\. Ibn Khaldun has written the following:\.

“When thaumaturgic feats are performed by others, what do you think about those who were distinguished for their knowledge and honesty and were a mirror of the Prophet’s traits, confiding what Allah had for them on account of their noble lineage, is a proof of the high performances of his chaste offspring \(Ahl al\-Bayt \[x\]\)\. Consequently,

many events about knowledge of the unknown are related about Ahl al\-Bayt \(x\), events which are not related about others” \(Al\-Muqaddima, p\. 23\)\.

<a id="page609"></a>Thus, there is no cause for wonder over Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s claim since he was brought up by the Prophet \(h\) and was a

student in Allah’s school\. Of course, those whose knowledge does not extend beyond the limits of physical goals and whose means of learning are confined to the bodily senses refuse to believe in the knowledge about the paths of the Divine cognizance and reality\. If this kind of claim was unique and was heard only from Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), then minds

could have wavered and temperaments could have hesitated to accept it\.

But if the Holy Quran records even such a claim of Aisha \(Jesus\) that “\.\.\. I can tell you what you eat or drink or store in your houses\.\.\.” then why should there be any hesitation about Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s claim when it is agreed upon that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had succeeded in

attaining distinctions of the Prophet \(h\), and it cannot be disputed that the Prophet \(h\) did not know what Aisha \(Jesus\) knew\. Thus, if the successor of the Prophet \(h\) advances such a claim, why should it be rejected, particularly since this vastness of knowledge of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) is the best testimony and proof of the Prophet’s knowledge and perfection, a living miracle testifying to his truthfulness\.

In this regard, it is amazing that even having knowledge of events which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) did not, through any of his words or

deeds, indicate that he knew them\. Thus, commenting about the extraordinary importance of this claim, Sayyid Ibn Tawus writes the following:\.

“An amazing aspect of this claim is that despite the fact that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) was aware of conditions and events, he

observed such conduct by way of his words and deeds that one who saw him could not believe that he knew the secrets and unknown acts of others because the wise agree that if a person knows what event is likely to take place or what step his comrade is going to take, or if the hidden secrets of people are known to him, then the effects of such knowledge will appear through his movements and the expressions of his face\. But the man who, in spite of knowing everything, behaves in a way as though he is unaware and knows nothing, personality is a miracle and a combination of contradictions\.

At this stage, the question arises as to why Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) did not act upon the dictates of his secret knowledge\. The reply

<a id="page610"></a>to this is that the commands of the Shar\`a are based on apparent conditions; otherwise, secret knowledge is a kind of miracle and power which Allah grants to His prophets and Imams\. Although the prophets and Imams possess this power always, they cannot make use of it at any time unless and until there is permission of Allah and on the proper occasion\. For example, the verse quoted above about Aisha \(Jesus\) which tells that he had the power to give life, to heal the blind and declare what one ate and stored in his house, etc\. he \(Jesus\) was not used to practice this power on everything or every corpse or everyone who met him\. He used to practice this power only by the permission of Allah and on the proper occasion\.

If prophets and other holy men acted on the basis of their secret knowledge, it would have meant serious dislocation and disturbance in the affairs of the people\. For example, if a prophet, or the Almighty, on the basis of his secret knowledge, punishes a condemnable man by killing him, there will be a great commotion and agitation among those who see it on the ground that he killed an “innocent” man\. This is why Allah has not permitted the basing of conclusions on secret knowledge except in a few special cases, enjoining the following of observable factors\. Thus, despite his being aware of the hypocrisy of some of the hypocrites, the Prophet \(h\) extended to them the amicable treatment that be extended to

other Muslims\.

Now, there can be no room for the objection that if Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) knew secret matters, then why did he not act accordingly?

The answer is: It has been demonstrated that he was not obliged to act according to the requirements of his secret knowledge\. Of course, where conditions so required, he did, indeed, disclose some matters for the purposes of preaching, admonishing, giving good tidings \(of rewards\) or warning \(against punishments\), so that future events could be avoided\. For example, Imam Ja\`far as\-Sadiq \(x\) informed Yahya ibn Zayd that if

he marched out \[against the Umayyads\], he would be killed\. Ibn Khaldun writes the following in this regard:\.

“It has been authentically related from Imam Ja\`far as\-Sadiq that he used to forewarn some of his close relatives of the fateful events to fall upon them\. For example, he forewarned his cousin Yahya ibn Zayd of being killed, but the latter disobeyed him; he marched out and was martyred in Juzjan” \(Al\-Muqaddama, p\. 233\)\.

<a id="page611"></a>Nevertheless, where there was apprehension that minds would worry, such was not disclosed at all\. That is why in this sermon Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) avoided more details in view of his apprehension that

people would begin to regard him as being higher than the Prophet \(h\)\. Despite all of this, people did, in fact, go astray about Isa \(Jesus\)\. Likewise with regard to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), some people also

started saying all sorts of things and were thus misled into resorting to exaggeration\.

**Sermon 175**

**Admonishing**

\(O creatures\!\) Seek benefit from the sayings of Allah, be admonished of Allah and accept the advice of Allah because Allah has left no excuse for you when He has provided clear guidance for you, has put before you the plea and clarified for you what deeds He likes and what deeds He hates, so that you may ac upon one and avoid the other\. The Prophet of Allah \(k\) used to say, “Paradise is surrounded by

unpleasant things, while Hell is surrounded by desires\.”

You should know that every act of obedience to Allah is unpleasant in appearance while every disobedience to Allah has the appearance of enjoyment\. May Allah have mercy on the person who keeps aloof from his desire and uproot the appetite of his heart because this heart has far\-reaching aims, yet it goes on pursuing disobedience through desires\.

You should know, O servants of Allah, that a believer should be distrustful of his heart every morning and evening\. He should always blame it \(for shortcomings\) and ask it to add to \(its good deeds\)\. You should behave like those who have gone before you and those ahead\. They left this world like a traveler and covered it as distance is covered\.

**The Greatness of the Holy Quran**

And be aware that this Holy Quran is an adviser that never deceives, a leader who never misleads, and a narrator who never speaks a lie\. No one will sit in the company of this Holy Quran except that when he rises, he will achieve one addition or one diminution: addition in his guidance or elimination in his \(spiritual\) blindness\. You should also know that no one will need any thing beyond \(guidance from\) the Holy Quran

<a id="page612"></a>and no one will be free from want beyond \(guidance from\) the Holy Quran\. Therefore, seek cure from it for your ailments and seek its assistance in your distresses\. It contains a cure for the most serious diseases, namely unbelief, hypocrisy, rebellion \(against God’s commandments\) and misguidance\. Pray to Allah through it and turn to Allah through loving it\. Do not ask the people through it\. There is nothing like it through which the people should turn to Allah, the Sublime\.

Be informed that it intercedes\. Its intercession will be accepted\. It is a speaker that testifies\. For whoever the Holy Quran intercedes on the Day of Judgement, its intercession for him will be accepted\. He about whom the Holy Quran speaks ill on the Day of Judgement shall testify to it\. On the Day of Judgement, an announcer will announce: ‘Beware\! Everyone who sow a crop is in distress except those who sow \(the seeds\) of the Holy Quran\.” Therefore, you should be among the sowers of the Holy Quran and of its followers\. Make it your guide towards Allah\. Seek its advice for yourselves\. Ddo not trust your views against it and regard your desires in the matter of the Holy Quran as deceitful\.

**About the believers and their good deeds, and the hypocrites and their bad deeds**

Action\! Action\! Then \(look at\) the end results \(of your actions and remain\) steadfast\. Steadfast\! Thereafter, \(exercise\) endurance\. Endurance and piety, piety\! You have an objective\. Proceed towards your objective\. You have a sign\. Take guidance from your sign\. Islam has an objective\. Proceed towards its objective\. Proceed towards Allah by fulfilling His rights which He has enjoined upon you\. He has clearly stated His demands\. I am a witness for you and shall plead for excuses on your behalf on the Day of Judgement\.

Beware\! What had been ordained has occurred, and that which had been destined has come to pass\. I am speaking to you with the promise and pleas of Allah\.

Allah the Sublime has said the following: “Verily, those who say: ‘Our Master is Allah\! and who persevere rightly, the angels descend upon them \(saying\): ‘Fear not, nor grieve and receive the glad tidings of the Garden which you were promised’” \(Holy Quran, 41: 30\)\.

You have said, “Our Master is Allah;” so, remain steadfast to His Book, to the way of His command, and to the virtuous course of worshiping Him\. Thereafter, do not go out of it, do not introduce

<a id="page613"></a>innovation in it, and do not turn away from it because those who shrink from this course will be cut off from \(the mercy of\) Allah on the Day of Judgement\.

Beware of corrupting your manners and altering them\. Maintain one stand\. A man should control his tongue because the tongue is obstinate with its master\. By Allah, I do not find fear of Allah benefitting a man who practices such fear unless he controls his tongue\. Certainly the tongue of a believer is at the back of his heart, while the heart of a hypocrite is at the back of his tongue\. When a believer intends to say anything, he thinks it over in his mind\. If it is good, he discloses it, but if it is bad, he keeps it concealed\. A hypocrite articulates whatever comes to his tongue, without knowing what is in his favor and what goes against him\.

The Prophet of Allah \(h\) said the following: “The belief of a

person cannot be firm unless his heart is firm, and his heart cannot be firm unless his tongue is firm\.” So, anyone of you can manage to meet Allah, the Sublime, in such a status that his hands are not smeared with the blood of Muslims and their property and his tongue are safe from exposition, he will do so\.

**Following the Sunnah and Refraining from Innovation**

Be informed, O servants of Allah, that a believer should regard lawful this year what he regarded lawful the past year and should consider unlawful this year what he considered unlawful in the past year\. Certainly people’s innovation cannot make lawful for you what has been declared as unlawful\. Rather, lawful is that which Allah has made lawful, and unlawful is that which Allah has made unlawful\. You have already tested the matters and tried them; you have been admonished by those before you\. Illustrations have been drawn for you, and you have been called to clear facts\. Only a deaf man can remain deaf to all this, and only a blind man can remain blind to all this\.

He whom Allah does not allow to benefit from trials and experiences cannot benefit from preaching\. He will be confronted by losses as he witnesses them, so much so that he will approve what is bad and disapprove what is good\. People are of two categories; followers of the Shar\`a \(religious laws\) and followers of innovations to which Allah has not given any testimony by way of Sunnah or the light of any plea\.

<a id="page614"></a>**Guidance from the Holy Quran**

The Holy Quran is the strong rope of Allah and the trustworthy means to reach out to Him\. It contains the blossoming of the heart and the springs of knowledge\. For the heart, there is no other gloss than the Holy Quran, although those who remembered it have passed away while those who forgot or pretended to have forgotten it have remained\. If you see anything good, give your support to it, but if you see evil, avoid it because the Messenger of Allah \(k\) used to say: “O son of Adam\! Do good and

shun evil; by doing so, you will be treading the Path correctly\.”

**Categories of Oppression**

Be informed that injustice is of three kinds: 1\) the injustice that will not be forgiven; 2\)one, that will not be left unquestioned and 3\) the one that will be forgiven without being questioned\. The injustice that will not be forgiven is duality of Allah\. Allah has said the following: “Verily, Allah does not forgive that \(anything\) be associated with Him” \(Holy Quran, 4: 48, 116\)\. The injustice that will be forgiven is the injustice one does to his own self by committing minor sins\. The injustice that will not be left unquestioned is the injustice of men against other men\. The retribution in such a case is severe\. It is not wounding with knives, nor striking with whips, but it is so severe that all these things are insignificant compared to it\. You should, therefore, avoid alteration with regard to Allah’s religion, for your unity with regard to something right which you dislike is better than your disunity with regard to something wrong that you like\. Certainly, Allah, the Glorified One, has not given any person, whether among the dead or among the living, anything good from disunity\.

O people\! Blessed is the man whose own shortcomings keep him away from \(looking into\) the shortcomings of others\. Also blessed is the man who is confined to his house, who eats his meal, buries himself in obedience to his Lord and weeps over his sins, so he keeps himself thus busy while people are safe from his harm\.

**Sermon 176**

**About the Two Arbiters \(Following the Battle of Siffn\)**\.

Your party decided to select two persons, so we took their pledge that they would adhere to the Holy Quran and would not commit excesses, that their tongues should be with it and their hearts should

<a id="page615"></a>follow it\. But they deviated from it, abandoned what was right although they had it before their very eyes\. Wrong\-doing was their desire and going astray was their conduct\. Although we had settled with them to decide with justice, to act according to what is right and without the interference of their evil views and wrong judgement\. Now that they have abandoned the course of right, coming out with just the opposite of what was settled, we have strong grounds \(to reject their verdict\)\.

**Sermon 177**

**Praising Allah, Transience of this World and Causes of the Decline of Allah’s Blessings \(Delivered at the Beginning of His Caliphate after the Killing of Othman\) **\.

One condition does not prevent Him from \(getting into\) another condition, time does not change Him, place does not locate Him and the tongue cannot describe Him\. The number of drops of water, of stars in the sky, or of currents of winds in the air, are not unknown to Him, nor are the movements of ants on rocks, or the resting places of grubs in the dark night\. He knows the places where leaves fall and the secret movements of the eyes\.

I testify that there is no god but Allah Who has no equal, Who is not doubted, Whose religion is not denied and Whose creativeness is not questioned\. My testimony is like that of a man whose intention is free, whose conscience is clear, whose belief is pure and whose scales \(of good deeds\) are heavy\. I also testify that Muhammad \(h\) is His servant and

Messenger, the chosen one from among His creations, the one selected for explaining His realities, chosen for His honors and to convey His sacred messages\. Through him, the signs of guidance have been lit and the gloom of blindness \(misguidance\) has been dispelled\.

O people\! Surely this world deceives him who yearns for it and who is attracted to it\. It does not behave niggardly with him who aspires for it and overpowers him who overpowers it\. By Allah, no people are deprived of the lively pleasures of life after having enjoyed them except as a result of sins committed by them because certainly Allah is not unjust to His creatures\. Even then, when calamities descend upon people and pleasures depart from them, they turn towards Allah with a true intention and the feeling in their hearts that He will return to them everything that has fled away from them, that He will cure all their ills\.

<a id="page616"></a>I fear about you lest you should fall into ignorance \(that prevailed before the mission of the Prophet \[h\]\)\. In the past, there were certain

matters in which you were deflected, and in my view, you were not worthy of admiration\. But if your previous status could be returned to you, then you will become virtuous\. I can only strive; but if I were to speak, I will \(only\) say: May Allah forgive your past actions\.

**Sermon 178**

**Di’bil al\-Yemeni asked Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) whether he had seen Allah\. The Imam \(x\) then replied, “Do I worship One Whom I have not seen?\!” The man then inquired, “How have you seen Him?” Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) replied as follows :**\.

Eyes do not see Him face\-to\-face, but hearts perceive Him through the realities of belief\. He is near to things but not \(physically\) contiguous\. He is far from them but not \(physically\) separate\. He speaks but not with reflection\. He intends, but not with preparation\. He molds, but not with \(the assistance of\) limbs\. He is subtle but cannot be said as being concealed\. He is great but cannot be said to be haughty\. He sees but the faculty of vision cannot be attributed to Him\. He is Merciful, but this cannot be attributed to a weakness of heart\. Faces bow down before His greatness and hearts tremble out of fear of Him\.

**Sermon 179**

**Condemning His Disobedient Men**

I praise Allah for whatever matter He ordained, for whatever action He destines, and for my trial with you, O folks who do not obey when I order and do not respond when I call upon\! If you are at ease, you engage in \(conceited\) conversations, but if you are faced with battle, you show weakness\. If people agree on one Imam, you taunt each other\. If you are faced with an arduous matter, you turn away from it\. May the others \(your foes\) have no father\! What are you waiting for with regard to your endeavor, when fighting for your rights? For you there is either death or disgrace\. By Allah\! If my day \(of death\) comes, and it is sure to come, it will cause separation between me and you, although I am sick of your company and feel lonely while being in your company\.

May Allah deal with you\! Is there any religion which may unite you?\! Do not you have any sense of shame that may sharpen you? Is it not

<a id="page617"></a>strange that Mu\`awiyah calls upon some rude low people and they follow him without any support or grant, but when I call upon you, although you are the promoters of Islam, the \(worthy\) survivors of the people, with support and grants, yet you run away from me and oppose me?\! Truly, there is nothing between us which I like and you, too, like, or anything with which I am angry and you may also unite against it\. What I love most is death\. I have taught you the Holy Quran, clarified to you its arguments, informed you of that with which you were ignorant and made you swallow what you were spitting out\. Even a blind man will have been able to see and he who was sleeping will have been awakened\. How ignorant of Allah is their leader, Mu\`awiyah, and their mentor, the son of

an\-Nabighah?179 These five persons were \(1\) al\-Asi ibn Wa’il, \(2\) Abu Lahab, \(3\) Umayyah ibn Khalaf, \(4\) Hisham ibn al\-Mughirah and \(5\) Abu Sufyan ibn Harb\. \(Ibn Abd Rabbih, Al\-Iqd al\-Farid, Vol\. 2, p\. 120; Ibn Tayfur, Balaghat an\-Nisa’, p\. 27; Ibn Hijjah, Thamarat al\-Awraq, Vol\. 1, p\. 132; Safwat, Jamharat Khutab al\-Arab, Vol\. 2, p\. 363; Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 6, pp\. 283\-285, 291; al\-Halabi, Al\-Sira, Vol\. 1, p\. 46\)\.1

**Sermon 180**

**Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) sent one of his men to bring him**

**news of a group of the army of Kufa who had decided to join the Kharijites but were afraid of him\.1 When the man came back, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said to him: “Are they satisfied and staying or feeling weak and going astray?” The man replied, “They have gone away, O Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib\!” Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said the following:**

179An\-Nabighah\(the genius\) is the surname of Layla daughter of Harmalah al\-Anaziyyah, mother of \`Amr ibn al\-As\. The reason for attributing him to his mother is her common reputation in the matter\. When Arwa daughter of al\-Harith ibn Abdul\-Muttalib went to Mu\`awiyah, during the conversation, when Amr ibn al\-As intervened, she said to him: “O son of an\-Nabighah, you too dare speak, although your mother was known publicly and was a singer of Mecca\. That is why five persons claimed you \(as a son\) and when she was asked she admitted that five people had visited her and that you should be regarded as the son of him resembled most\. You must have resembled al\-As ibn Wa’il and, therefore, you came to be known as his son\.

180A man from the tribe of Banu Najiyah named al \-Khirrit ibn Rashid an\-Naji was on Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s side in the battle of Siffin, but after arbitration, he became rebellious and, coming to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

with thirty persons, said the following: “By Allah, I will no more obey your command, nor offer prayers behind you and shall leave you tomorrow,”

<a id="page618"></a>May Allah’s mercy remain away from them as in the case of Thamud\. Be informed that when the spears are hurled towards them and the swords strike their heads, they will repent their deeds\. Surely today Satan has scattered them and tomorrow he will deny having anything to do with them and will abandon them\. They have departed from guidance and returned to misguidance and blindness\. They have turned away from truth and fallen into wrong; such suffices \(for their chastisement\)\.

**Sermon 181**

**It has been related by Nawf al\-Bikali that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) delivered this sermon at Kufa standing on a stone which Ja’dah ibn Hubayrah al\-Makhzumi had placed for him\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had a woollen apparel on his body, the belt of his**

**sword was made of leaves and the sandals on his feet too were of palm leaves\. His forehead had a hardened spot like that a camel \(on its knee, due to many and long prostrations\)\. About Allah’s attributes, His creatures and His being above physical limitations :**

whereupon Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said the following: “You should first

take into account the grounds underlying this Arbitration and discuss it with me\. If you are satisfied, do as you will\.” He said he would return the next day to discuss the matter\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) then cautioned him thus: “Look,

upon going from here, do not get mislead by others, and do not adopt any other course\. If you have the will to understand, I will get you out of this wrong path and put you on the course of guidance\.” After this conversation, the man went away, but his countenance indicated that he was bent on rebelling and that he would not see reason by any means\. And so it happened\. He stuck to his point\. Having reached his place, he said to his tribesmen, “Since we are determined to abandon Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), there is no use going to him\. We should

do what we have decided to do\.” On this occasion, Abdullah ibn Qu’ayn al\-Azdi also went to them to inquire\. But when he came to know the situation, he asked Mudrik ibn ar\-Rayyan an\-Naji to speak to him and to advise him of the ruinous consequence of this rebellion, whereupon Mudrik assured him that this man would not be allowed to take any step\. Consequently, \`Abdullah came back satisfied and related the whole matter to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) on

returning the next day\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said, “Let us see what happens when he comes\.” But when the appointed hour passed and the man did not turn up, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) asked Abdullah to go and see what the matter was and what the cause for the delay was\. On reaching there, Abdullah found that all of them had left\. When he returned to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\),

the Imam delivered this sermon\. The fate that befell al\-Khirrit ibn Rashd an\-Naji has been stated in Sermon 44\.

<a id="page619"></a>Praise be to Allah to Whom is the return of all creation and the end of all matters\. We render Him praise for the greatness of His generosity, the charity of His proofs, the increase of His bounty\.\.\. And for His favors, a praise which may fulfil His right, repay His thanks, take \(us\) near His reward and produce an increase in His kindness\. We seek His help like one who is hopeful of His bounty, desirous of His benefit and confident of His warding \(calamities\) off, one who acknowledges His gifts and is obedient to Him in word and in deed\. We believe in Him like one who reposes hope in Him with conviction, inclines to Him as a believer, humbles himself before Him obediently, believes in His Oneness exclusively, regards Him as great, acknowledging His dignity and seeks refuge with Him with inclination and exertion\.

Allah, the most Glorified One, has not been born so that someone could be \(His\) partner in glory\. Nor has He begotten anyone so as to be inherited\. Time has not preceded Him\. Increase and decrease do not apply to Him\. But He has manifested Himself to our understanding when we observe His strong control and firm decree\. Among the proofs of His creation is the creation of the skies which are fastened without pillars, standing without support\. He called them and they responded obediently and humbly without being reluctant or loathsome\. If they had not acknowledged His being the Lord and not obeyed Him, He would not have made them the place for His throne, the abode of His angels and the destination of the pure utterances and righteous deeds of the creatures\.

He has made the stars in the skies by way of signs for the guidance of travelers who traverse the various routes of the earth\. The gloom of the dark curtains of the night does not prevent the flame of their light, nor do the veils of blackish nights have the power to turn back the light of the moon when it spreads in the skies\. Glory to Allah from Whom neither the blackness of dark dusk nor of gloomy nights in the low parts of the earth or on high dim mountains is hidden, nor the thundering of clouds on the horizons of the skies, nor the sparking of lightning in the clouds, nor the falling of leaves blown away from their falling places by the winds of hurricanes or by downpour from the sky\. He knows where the drops fall and where they settle, where the grubs leave their trails or drag themselves, what livelihood will suffice the mosquitoes and what a female bears in its womb\.

<a id="page620"></a>Praise be to Allah Who exists before the existence of the seat, the throne, the sky, the earth, the jinns or the humans\. He cannot be perceived by imagination nor measured by comprehension\. He who pleads to Him does not divert Him \(from others\), nor does giving away cause Him diminution\. He does not see by means of an eye, nor can He be confined to a place\. He cannot be said to have companions\. He does not create with \(the help of\) limbs\. He cannot be perceived by senses\. He cannot be thought of as we think of people\.

It is He who spoke to Musa \(Moses\) clearly and showed Him His great signs without the use of bodily parts, the means of speech or the uvula\. O you who exert yourself in describing Allah\! If you are serious, then \(first try to\) describe Gabriel, Michael or the host of angels who are close \(to Allah\) in the receptacles of sublimity\. But their heads are bent downwards and their wits are perplexed as to how to assign limits \(of definition\) to the Highest Creator\. This is so because those things can only be perceived through qualities which have shape and parts and which succumb to death after reaching the end of their times\. There is no god but He\. He has lighted every darkness with His glory and has darkened every light with the darkness \(of death\)\.

**An Account of Bygone Peoples and Learning from Them**

I admonish you, servants of Allah, to fear Allah Who clothed you well and bestowed upon you an abundance of sustenance\. If there was anyone who could secure a ladder to everlasting life or a way to avoid death, it was Sulayman ibn Dawud \(x\) \[Solomon son of David\] who was

given control over the domain of the jinns and men along with Prophethood and a great status with Allah\. But when he exhausted appointed ration \(of this world\) and his \(fixed\) time expired, the bow of destruction shot him with an arrow of death\. His mansions became vacant and his habitations became empty\. Another group of people inherited them\. Certainly, the by\-gone centuries have a lesson for you\.

Where are the Amalekites181 and the sons of the Amalekites?

Where are the Pharaohs?182 But when his empire in the end was

181History shows that very often the ruin and destruction of peoples has been due to their oppression and open wickedness and profligacy\. Consequently, communities which had extended their sway over all the corners of the populated world and had flown their flags in the East and West of the globe disappeared from the surface of the earth like a wrong word, on disclosure of their vicious actions and evil doings\. The Amalekites were ancient nomadic

<a id="page621"></a>destroyed in a few moments\. Neither his status nor his servants could come in the way of its destruction, nor could the vastness of his realm

tribesmen, or a group of tribes, described in the Old Testament as relentless enemies of Israel, even though they were closely related to Ephraim, one of the twelve tribes of Israel\. Their name is derived from Amalek, who is celebrated in Arabian tradition but cannot be identified\. The region over which they ruled extended from southern Judea and probably extended into northern Arabia\. The Amalekites harassed the Hebrews during the latter’s exodus from Egypt, attacking them at Rephidim \(near Mt\. Sinai\), where they were defeated by Joshua\. They also filled out the ranks of the nomadic raiders defeated by Gideon and were condemned to annihilation by Samuel\. The Amelekites, whose final defeat occurred in the time of Hezekiah, were the object of a perpetual curse\. \(See _The New Encyclopedia Britannica_ \[Micropedia\], Vol\. 1, p\. 288, ed\. 1973 \- 1974\]; also see \[for further reference\] the _Encyclopedia Americana_ \[International Edition\] Vol\. 1, p\. 651, ed\. 1975\)\.

182“Pharaoh” is a Hebrew word form of the Egyptian “per\-Ao”, the great house, signifying the royal palace, an epithet applied in the new Kingdom and after, as a title of respect, to the Egyptian king himself\. In the 22nd dynasty, this title was added to the king’s personal name\. In official documents, the full titulary of the Egyptian king contained five names\. The first and the oldest identified him as the incarnation of the falcon god Horus\. It was often written inside a square called ‘serekh”, depicting the facade of the archaic palace\. The second name, “two ladies”, placed him under the protection of Nekh\-bet and Buto, the vulture and Uraeus \(snake\) goddesses of Upper and Lower Egypt\. The third, “golden Horus”, originally signified perhaps Horus victorious over his enemies\. The last two names, written within a ring or cartouche, are generally referred to as the praenomen and nomen and were the ones most commonly used\. The praenomen, preceded by the hieroglyph meaning “King of Upper and Lower Egypt”, usually contained a reference to the king’s Unique relationship with the sun god, Re, while the fifth, or nomen, was preceded by the hieroglyph for “son of Re”, or by that for Master of the Two Lands\. The last name was given him at birth, the rest at his coronation\. \(_The New Encyclopedia Britannica_ \[Micropodia\], Vol\. VII, p\. 927, ed\. 1973\-1974; also see \[for further reference\] the _Encyclopedia Americana_, \[International Edition\], Vol\. 21, p\. 707, ed\. 1975\)\.

Among the Pharaohs was Pharaoh who was contemporary to Prophet Musa \(x\)\. His pride, egotism, insolence and haughtiness were such that by

making the claim “I am your supreme god,” he deemed himself to be holding sway over all other powers of the world\. He was confused into misunderstanding that no power could wrest the realm and government from his hands\. The Holy Quran has narrated his claim of “I and no one else” in the following verse: _And Pharaoh proclaimed to his people: “O my people\! Is not_ _the kingdom of Egypt mine? And these rivers flow below me; What\! behold you not? \(Holy Quran 43: 51\)_

<a id="page622"></a>prevent it\. Rather, the waves of the very streams of which he was extremely proud, wrapped him in and dispatched his soul to Hell, throwing the body on the bank to serve as a lesson for the whole of creation\. Where are the people of the cities of ar\-Rass183 who killed the prophets, destroyed the traditions of the holy messengers and revived the traditions of the despots? Where are those who advanced with armies, defeated thousands, mobilized forces and populated cities?

**Part of the same sermon about Imam al\-Mahdi \(x\)**

He will be wearing the amour of wisdom, which he will have secured with all its conditions, such as full attention towards it, \(complete\) knowledge of and exclusive devotion to it\. For him, it is like a thing which he had lost and which he was then seeking, or a need which he was trying to fulfil\. If Islam is in trouble, he will feel forlorn like a traveler and like a \(tired\) camel beating the end of its tail, with its neck flattened on the ground\. He is the last of Allah’s proofs and one of the vicegerents of His prophets\.

**On the Method of His Ruling and Grief over the Martyrdom of His Companions**

O people\! I have divulged to you advice which the prophets used to preach to their peoples, and I have conveyed to you what the vicegerents \(of the prophets\) conveyed for the benefit of those coming after them\. I tried to train you with my whip but you could not be straightened\. I drove you with admonition but you did not acquire proper behavior\. May Allah deal with you\! Do you want an Imam other than me to take you on the \(right\) path and show you the correct way?

Beware, the things in this world which were forward have become things of the past, and those which were behind are going ahead\.

183Who were the people of the cities of ar\-Rass? In the same way as above, the people of ar\-Rass were killed and destroyed for disregarding the preaching and the call of their prophet and for their rebellion and disobedience\. About them the Holy Qur’an says the following: _And the \(tribes of\)_ _\}d and_ _Thamud, and the inhabitants of ar\-Rass, and generations between them, in great number\. And unto each of them We did give examples and everyone \(of them\) We did destroy with utter destruction \(Holy Quran 25: 38,39\); Belied \(also\) before them were the people of Noah and the dwellers of ar\-Rass and Thamud, and \}d and Pharaoh, and the brethren of Lot, and the dwellers of the Wood and the people of Tubba’; all belied the Messengers, so My promise \(of the doom\)was proved true \(Holy Quran 50: 12\-14\)\._

<a id="page623"></a>The virtuous people of Allah have made up their minds to leave and they have traded, with a little perishable \(pleasure\) of this world, a lot of such \(reward\) in the next world that will remain forever\. What loss did our brothers, whose blood was shed in Siffin, suffer by not being alive today? Only that they are not suffering from choking upon swallowing and not drinking turbid water\. By Allah, surely they have met Allah and He has bestowed upon them their rewards; He has lodged them in safe houses after their \(having suffered\) fear\.

Where are my brethren who took the \(right\) path and trod in righteousness/ Where is Ammar? Where is ibn at\-Tayyihan? Where is Dhul\-Shahadatayn? And where are others like them7 from among their comrades who had pledged themselves to remain steadfast till death and whose \(severed\) heads were taken to the wicked enemy?

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) wiped his hand over his auspicious, honored beard and wept for a long time, then he went on to say:

O brothers who recited the Holy Quran and strengthened it, thought over their obligation and fulfilled it, revived the Sunnah and destroyed innovation\! When they were called to jihad, they responded and trusted in their leader then followed him\.

**Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Shouted the Following at the Top of His Voice:**

Al\-Jihad, al\- Jihad\! O servants of Allah\! By Allah, I am mobilizing the army today\. He who desires to proceed towards Allah should come forward\.

Nawf says the following: “Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) put Hussain \(x\) in charge of \(a force of\) ten thousand, Qays ibn Sa\`d \(mercy

of Allah be upon him\) over ten thousand, Abu Ayyub al\-Ansari over ten thousand and others over different numbers, intending to return to Siffin\. But on Friday, the Imam \(x\) did not appear in public again; the damned

Ibn Muljim \(may Allah curse him\) killed him\. Consequently, the armies came back and were left like sheep who had lost their shepherd while wolves were snatching them away from all sides\.

Ammar ibn Yasir ibn Amir al\-Madhhaji al\-Makhzumi \(Madhhaj being an ally of Banu Makhzum\) was one of the earliest converts to Islam and the first Muslim to build a mosque in his own house in which he used

<a id="page624"></a>to worship Allah \(Al\-Tabaqat, Vol\. 3, Part 1, p\. 178; Usd al\-Ghabah, Vol\.

4, p\. 46; Ibn Kathir, Tarikh, Vol\. 7, p\.311\)\.

Ammar accepted Islam along with his father Yasir and his mother Sumayya\. They suffered great atrocities at the hands of the tribesmen of Quraish due to their conversion to Islam to such an extent that Ammar lost his parents, and they were the first martyrs in Islam\.

Ammar was among those who immigrated to Abyssinia and the earliest immigrants \(Muhajirun\) to Medina\. He was present in the battle of Badr and all other battles as well as places of assembly by the Muslims during the lifetime of the Holy Prophet \(h\)\. He demonstrated his mighty support in all Islamic struggles in the best way\.

Many traditions are narrated from the Holy Prophet \(h\) about

Ammar regarding his virtues, outstanding traits and glorious deeds such as the tradition which Aisha and others have narrated that the Holy Prophet \(h\) himself had said that Ammar was filled with faith from the

crown of his head to the soles of his feet\. \(Ibn Majah, Sunan, Vol\. 1, p\. 65; Abu Nu’aym, Hilyat al\-Awliya’, Vol\. 1, p\. 139; al\-Haytami, Majma’ az\-Zawa’id, Vol\. 9, p\.295; Al\-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 3, p\. 1137; Al\-Isaba, Vol\. 2, p\. 512\)\.

In another tradition, the Holy Prophet \(h\) said the following about Ammar:\.

“Ammar is with the truth and the truth is with Ammar\. He turns wherever the truth turns\. Ammar is as close to me as an eye is close to the nose\. Alas\! A rebellious group will kill him” \(Al\-Tabaqat, Vol\. 3, part 1, p\. 187; Al\- Mustadrak, Vol\. 3, p\. 392; Ibn Hisham, Sira, Vol\. 2, p\. 143; Ibn Kathir, Tarikh, Vol\. 7, pp\. 268\-270\)\.

Also in the decisive and widely known tradition which al\-Bukhari \(in his Sahih, Vol\. 8, pp\. 185 \-186\), at\-Tirmithi \(in Al\- Jami’ Sahih, Vol\. 5, p\. 669\); Ahmed ibn Hanbal \(in Al\- Musnad, Vol\. 2, pp\. 161, 164, 206; Vol\. 3, pp\. 5, 22, 28, 91; Vol\. 4, pp\. 197, 199; Vol\. 5, pp\. 215, 306, 307; Vol\. 6, pp\. 289, 300, 311, 315\) and all the narrators of Islamic traditions and historians transmitted through twenty\-five Companions that the Holy Prophet \(h\) said the following about Ammar:\.

“Alas\! A rebellious group which swerves from the truth will murder Ammar\. Ammar will be calling them towards Paradise and they

<a id="page625"></a>will be calling him towards Hell\. His killer and those who strip him of arms and clothing will all be in Hell\.”

Ibn Hajar al\- Asqalani \(in Tahthib al\-Tahthib, Vol\. 7, p\. 409; Al\-Isaba, Vol\. 2, p\.512\) and al\-Sayyuti \(in Al\-Khasa’is al\-Kubra, Vol\. 2, p\.

1. say: “The narration of this \(above mentioned\) tradition is mutawatir \(i\.e\. narrated successively by so many people that no doubt can be entertained about its authenticity\)\.

Ibn Abdul\-Barr \(in Al\-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 3, p\. 1140\) says the following:\.

“The narration followed uninterrupted succession from the Holy Prophet \(h\) saiying the following: “A rebellious group will murder

Ammar,” and this is a prediction of the Prophet’s secret knowledge and the sign of his Prophethood\. This tradition is among the most authentic and the most rightly ascribed traditions\.

After the death of the Holy Prophet \(h\), Ammar was one of the closest adherents and best supporters of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

during the reign of the first three Caliphs\. During the caliphate of Othman when the Muslim population protested against Othman’s policy regarding a number of issues including the distribution of the Public Treasury \(baytul\-mal\) Othman said at a public assembly that, “The money which was in the treasury was sacred and belonged to Allah and that he \(as being the successor of the Prophet \[h\)\) had the right to dispose of them as he

thought fit\. He \(Othman\) threatened and cursed all those who presumed to censure or murmur at what he said\. Upon this, Ammar ibn Yasir boldly declared his disapprobation and began to charge him with his inveterate propensity to ignore the interests of the general public; accused him with reviving the heathenish customs abolished by the Prophet \(h\),

whereupon Othman ordereded him to be beaten\. Imediately some Umayyads, the relatives of the Caliph fell upon the venerable Ammar and the Caliph himself, kicking the lattedr with his shoes \(on his feet\) on Ammar’s testicles and afflicted him with a hernia\. Amma became unconscious for three days and was taken care of by Umm al\-Mu’minin \[mother of the Faithful\] Umm Salamah in her own house \( al \-Baladhiri, Ansab al\-Ashraf, Vol\. 5, pp\. 48, 54, 88; Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 3, pp\. 47\-52; Al\-Imamah wal\-Siyasa, Vol\. 1, pp\. 35\-36; Al\-\`Iqd al\-Farid, Vol\. 4, p\. 307; Al\-Tabaqat, Vol\. 3, Part 1, p\. 185; Tarikh al\-Khamis, Vol\. 2, p\. 271\)\.

<a id="page626"></a>When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) became Caliph, Ammar was

one of his most sincere supporters\. Ammar participated fully in all social, political and military activities during this period, especially in the first battle \(the Battle of Jamal\) and in the second \(the battle of Siffin\)\.

However, Ammar was martyred on the 9th of Safar, 37 A\.H\., in the battle of Siffin when he was over ninety years old\. On the day Ammar ibn Yasir achieved martyrdom, he turned his face to the sky and said the following:\.

“O Lord\! Surely You are aware that if I know that You wish that I should plunge myself into this River \(the Euphrates\) and be drowned, I will do it\. O Lord\! Surely You know that if I knew that You would be pleased if I put my scimitar on my chest \(to hit my heart\) and press it so hard that it comes out of my back, I would do it\. O Lord\! I do not think there is anything more pleasant to You than fighting this sinful group\. If I knew that any action at all is more pleasing to You, I would do it\.”

Abu Abd ar\-Rahman al\-Salami narrates the following:\.

“We were present with Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) at Siffin when I saw Ammar ibn Yasir not turning his face in any direction, or towards any valley of Siffin, but the companions of the Holy Prophet \(h\)

were following him as if he was a sign for them\. Then I heard Ammar say the following to Hashim ibn Utbah \(al \-Mirqal\): ‘O Hashim\! Rush into the enemy’s ranks, for Paradise is under the shade of the sword\! Today, I shall meet the beloved one, Muhammad \(h\) and his party\.’

“Then he said the following: ‘By Allah\! If they put us to fight \(and pursue us\) to the date\-palms of Hajar \(a town in Bahrain \[i\.e\. if they pursue us along all the Arabian desert\] nevertheless\) we know surely that we are right and they are wrong\.’

“Then he \(Ammar\) continued \(addressing the enemies\) thus: ‘We struck you so that you may \(believe in\) its \(Holy Quran\\s\) revelation; And today we strike you to \(believe in\) its interpretation; Such strike as to remove heads from their resting places; And to make the friend forget his sincere friend, until the truth returns to its \(right\)

course\.’”

The narrator says the following: “I did not see the Holy Prophet’s companions killed at any time as many as they were killed on that day\.”

<a id="page627"></a>Then Ammar spurred his horse, entered the battlefield and began fighting\. He persistently chased the enemy, launching one attack after another, raising challenging slogans till at last a group of mean\-spirited Syrians surrounded him from all sides\. A man named Abul\-Ghadiyah al\-Juhari \(al\- Fazari\) inflicted such a wound upon him that Ammar could not withstand it\. Ammar returned to his camp and asked for water\. A tumbler of milk was brought to him\. When Ammar looked at the tumbler, he said the following: “The Messenger of Allah had said the right thing\.” People asked him what he meant by those words\. He said, “The Messenger of Allah \(k\) informed me that my last sustenance in the life of this world

would be milk\.” Then he took that tumbler of milk in his hands, drank the milk and surrendered his life to Allah, the Almighty\. When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) came to know of his death, he came to Ammar’s side, put

his \(Ammar’s\) head on his own lap and recited the following elegy to mourn his death:

Surely any Muslim who is not distressed at the killing of the son of Yasir and is not afflicted by this grievous misfortune does not have a true faith\.

May Allah shower His mercy on Ammar the day he embraced Islam; may Allah shower His mercy on Ammar the day he was killed, and may Allah shower His mercy on Ammar the day he is raised to life\.

Certainly, I found Ammar \(on such level\) that three companions of the Holy Prophet \(h\) could not be named unless he was the fourth, and four of them could not be mentioned unless he was the fifth\.\.\.

There was none among the Holy Prophet’s companions who doubted this: Not only was Paradise once or twice bestowed upon Ammar, but that he gained his claim to it \(a number of times\)\. May Paradise give enjoyment to Ammar\.

Certainly, it was said \(by the Holy Prophet \[h\]\): “Surely,

Ammar is with the truth, and the truth is with Ammar; he turns wherever the truth turns; his killer will certainly be lodged in hell\.”

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) stepped forward and offered the

funeral prayers for Ammar and with his own hands he buried him with his clothes still on\.

<a id="page628"></a>Ammar’s death caused a good deal of commotion in the ranks of Mu\`awiyah, too, because there a large number of prominent people fighting on the side of Mu\`awiyah under the impression hat he was fighting Imam

Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) for a just cause\. These people were aware of the saying of the Holy Prophet \(h\) that Ammar would be killed by a

group that would be on the wrong track\. When they observed that Ammar had been killed by Mu\`awiyah’s army, they became convinced that they were on the wrong side and that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) was

definitely on the track\. This agitation thus caused among leaders as well as in the rank and file of Mu\`awiyah’s army was quelled by the latter with the argument that it was Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) who brought Ammar

to the battlefield and, therefore, it was he who was responsible for Ammar’s death\. When Mu\`awiyah’s argument was mentioned before Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), the Imam said that it was as if the Prophet

\(h\) was responsible for killing \[his brave uncle\] Hamzah since he

himself had brought him to the battlefield of Uhud\! \(al\-Tabari, Tarkh, Vol\. 1, pp\. 3316\-3322; Vol\. 3, pp\. 2314\-2319; Ibn Sa\`d, Al\- Tabaqat, Vol\. 3, Part 1, pp\. 176\-189; Ibn al\-Athir, Al\-Kamil, Vol\. 3, pp\. 308\-312; Ibn Kathir, Tarikh, Vol\. 7, pp\. 267\-272; al\-Minqari, Siffin, pp\. 320\-345; Ibn Abdul \-Barr, Al\-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 3, pp\. 1135\-1140; Vol\. 4, p\. 1725; Ibn al\-Athir, Usd al\-Ghaba, Vol\. 4, pp\. 43\-47; Vol\. 5, p\. 267; Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 5, pp\. 252\-258; Vol\. 8, pp\. 10\-28; Vol\. 10,

Abul\- Haytham \(Malik\) ibn at\-Tayyihan al\-Ansari was one of the twelve chiefs \(naqibs \[of the Ansar\] who attended the fair and met at al\-Aqabah the first and the second times\. It was there that he swore the pledge of allegiance to the Holy Prophet of Islam \(h\)\. He was present

also during the battle of Badr and in all other battles in addition to all places of assembly by the Muslims during the lifetime of the Holy Prophet \(h\)\. He was also among the sincere supporters of Imam Ali ibn

Abu Talib \(x\) on whose side he fought during the Battles of Jamal and of

Siffin where he was martyred \(Al\-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 4, p\. 1773; Siffin, p\. 365; Usd al\-Ghaba, Vol\. 4, p\. 274; Vol\. 5, p\. 318; Al\-Isaba, Vol\. 3, p\. 341;

<a id="page629"></a>Vol\. 4, pp\. 312 \-313; Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 10, pp\. 107\-108; Ansab al\-Ashraf, p\. 319\)\.

Khuzaymah ibn Thabit al\-Ansari \[who is referred to above\] is known as “Dhul\-Shahadatayn” \(the man with the two testimonials\) because the Holy Prophet \(h\) considered his testimony equivalent to that

of two witnesses\. He was present in the battle of Badr and in other battles as well as in the places of assembly of the Muslims during the lifetime of the Holy Prophet \(h\)\. He is counted among the earliest of those who

showed their adherence to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\. He was also

present in the Battles of Jamal and Siffin\. Abd ar\-Rahman ibn Abu Layla narrated that he saw a man in the battle of Siffin fighting the enemy valiantly, and when he protested against his action, the man said the following:\.

“I am Khuzaymah ibn Thabit al\-Ansari\. I have heard the Holy Prophet \(h\) saying, ‘Fight, fight, on the side of Ali’” \( orator al\-Baghdadi, Muwaddih Awham al\-Jam’ wal\-Tafriq, Vol\. 1, p\. 277\)\.

Khuzaymah was martyred in the battle of Siffn soon after the martyrdom of Ammar ibn Yasir\.

Sayf ibn \`Umar al\-Usaydi \(the well known liar\) has fabricated another Khuzaymah and claimed that the one who was martyred in the battle of Siffin was this one and not the one titled “Dhul\-Shahadatayn”\. Al\- Tabari has quoted this fabricated story from Sayf either intentionally or; otherwise, and through him this story has affected some other historians who quoted from or relied on al \-Tabari\. For further reference, see al\-‘Askari, Khamsun wa miah sahabi mukhtalaq \[one hundred and fifty fabricated companions\], Vol\. 2, pp\. 175\-189\.

After having rejected this fabrication, Ibn Abul\-Hadid adds \(in Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 10, pp\. 109\-110\) that: “Furthermore, what is the need for those who, in order to defend Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), boast of an abundance of statements by Khuzaymah, Abul\-Haytham, Ammar and others? If people treat this man \(Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \[x\]\)

with justice and look at him with healthy eyes, they will certainly realize that should he be alone \(on one side\) and all other people \(on the other side\) fighting him, he will still be on the side of the truth while all the rest will be wrong” \(Al\-Tabaqat, Vol\. 3, Part 1, pp\. 185, 188; Al\- Mustadrak, Vol\. 3, pp\. 385, 397; Usd al\-Ghaba, Vol\. 2, p\. 114; Vol\. 4, p\. 47; Al\-

<a id="page630"></a>Isti\`ab, Vol\. 2, p\. 448; al\-Tabari, Vol\. 3, pp\. 2316, 2319, 2401; Al\- Kamil, Vol\. 3, p\. 325; Siffin, pp\. 363, 398; Ansab al\-Ashraf, pp\. 313\-314\)\.

Among the people who were present during the Battle of Jamal on the side of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) were one hundred and thirty Badris \(those who participated in the battle of Badr with the Holy Prophet \[h\]\) and seven hundred of those who were present in the Pledge of ar\-

Ridwan \(Bay’at al\-Ridwan\) which took place under a tree \(al\-Dhahbi, Tarikh al\-Islam, Vol\. 2, p\. 171; Khalifah ibn Khayyat, Tarikh, Vol\. 1, p\. 164\)\. Those who were killed in the Battle of Jamal from among the supporters of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) numbered about five hundred

\(some said that the number of martyrs were more than that\)\. But on the side of the people of Jamal, twenty thousand were killed \(Al\-Iqd al\-Farid, Vol\. 4, p\. 326\)\.

Among those who were present in the Battle of Siffin on the side of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), there were eighty Badris and eight hundred of those who swore to the Holy Prophet \(h\) the Pledge of al\-

Ridwan \(Al\-Mustadrak, Vol\. 3, p\. 104; Al\-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 3, p\. 1138; Al\-Isaba, Vol\. 2, p\. 389; Tarkh, al\-Ya\`qubi, Vol\. 2, p\. 188\)\.

On the side of Mu\`awiyah, forty\-five thousand were killed, and on the sides of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), twenty\-five thousand\. Among these martyrs \(from the camp of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \[x\]\), there were

twenty\-five or twenty\-six Badris and sixty\-three or three hundred and three of the people of the Pledge of ar\-Ridwan \(Siffin, p\. 558; Al\-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 2, p\. 389; Ansab al\-Ashraf, p\. 322; Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 10, p\. 104; Abul\-Fida’, Vol\. 1, p\. 175; Ibn al\-Wardi, Tarkh, Vol\. 1, p\. 240; Ibn Kathr, Vol\. 7, p\. 275; Tarikh al\-Khams, Vol\. 2, p\. 277\)\.

Besides the distinguished and eminent companions of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), such as Ammar, “Dhul\-Shahadatayn” and Ibn al\-Tayyihan, those who were martyred in Siffin were:

i\. Hashim ibn \`Utbah ibn Abu Waqqas al\-Mirqal\. He was killed on the same day when Ammar was martyred\. He was the bearer of the standard of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s army on that day\.

1. Abdullah ibn Budayl ibn al\-Warqa al\-Khuza’i\. Sometimes, he was the right wing’s Commander of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s army and sometimes the infantry’s Commander\.

**Sermon 182**

**Praising Allah for His Bounties**

Praise be to Allah Who is recognized without being seen and Who creates without weariness\. He created everything with His Might, and He receives the devotion of rulers by virtue of His dignity\. He exercises superiority over great men through His generosity\. It is He who made His creation populate the world and sent to the jinns and human beings His messengers to clarify His Message for them, to warn them of taking it lightly, to present to them its examples, and to place before them a whole collection of matters containing lessons about the changing of health and sickness in life of this world, what is lawful and what is unlawful, and all that Allah has ordained for the obedient ones as well as for the disobedient, namely, Paradise and Hell, honor and disgrace, respectively\. I extend my praise to His Being as He desires His creation to praise Him\. He has fixed for everything a measure, for every measure a time limit, and for every time limit a record\.

**Part of the Same Sermon: the Greatness and Importance of the Holy Quran**

The Holy Quran bids and forbids, remains silent and speaks\. It is the Argument of Allah before His creation\. He has taken from them a pledge \(to act\) upon it\. He has perfected its glory and completed through it His creed\. He let the Prophet \(h\) leave this world once he had

conveyed to the people all His commandments of guidance through the Holy Quran\. You should, therefore, regard Allah as Great as He has held Himself Great because He has not concealed anything of His religion from you, nor has He left out anything which He likes or dislikes\. He made for everything a clear sign \(of guidance\) and a definite indication, either prohibiting \(us\) from doing it or calling upon us to uphold it\. What pleases Him is the same for now, in the past, and for all times to come\.

You should know that He will not be pleased with you if you do anything with which He was displeased by those before you who committed it, and He will not be displeased with you for anything for which won His pleasure when acted upon by those before you\. You are treading on a clear path and are speaking the same as the people before you had spoken\. Allah suffices you for the achievement of your worldly needs\. He has persuaded you to remain thankful \(with your hearts\) and has made it obligatory on you to mention Him with your tongues\.

<a id="page632"></a>**Warning Against the Punishment on the Day of Judgement**

He has advised you to be pious, making piety the highest point of earning His pleasure and all that He requires from His creatures\. You should, therefore, fear Allah in such a way as if you stand in front of Him\. Your forelocks are in His grip and your change of condition is in His control\. If you conceal a matter from anyone, you cannot conceal it from Him\. If you disclose a matter, He will record it\. For this, He has appointed honored guards \(angels\) who do not omit any rightful matter nor insert anything of their own\. You should know that whoever fears Allah, He will make for him a way to get out of troubles and \(grant him\) a light \(to help him get\) out of darkness\. He will always keep him in whatever \(condition\) He wishes and will make him stay in a status of honor near Him, in the abode \(of bliss\)which He has made for Himself\. The shade of this abode is His throne; its light is His glory, its visitors are His angels, and its companions are His prophets\.

Therefore, hasten towards such a place of return and proceed to \(your\) ends \(by collecting provision for the next world\)\. Shortly, the expectations of the people will be cut short and death will overtake them, while the door of repentance will be closed for them\. You are still in a place to which those who were before you have been wishing to return\. In this world, which is not your \[eternal\] abode, you are just like a traveler in motion\. You have been given the call to leave from here, and you have been ordered to collect provisions while you are still here\. You should know that this thin skin cannot tolerate the Fire \(of Hell\)\. So, have pity on your own selves because you have already tried it in the tribulations of this world\.

Have you ever seen how a person cries of the pain when he has been pricked with a thorn or who bleeds due to stumbling or whom hot sand has burnt? How will he feel when he is between two frying pans of Hell with stones all around, with Satan as his companion? Do you know that when Malik \(the custodian of Hell\) is angry with the fire, its parts begin to clash with each other \(in rage\), and when he scolds it, it leaps between the doors of Hell crying on account of his scolding?

O you old folks whom old age has made hoary, how will you feel when rings of fire touch the bones of your neck and when handcuffs hold you so hard that they eat away the flesh of your forearms? \(Fear\) Allah\! \(Fear\) Allah\! O crowd of men, while you are in good health before sickness \(grips you\), when you are in ease before hardship \(overtakes you\)\. You should aspire to release your necks before their mortgage is

<a id="page633"></a>foreclosed, and your eyes; thin down your bellies, use your feet \(to go where you earn the Pleasure of Allah\); spend your wealth \(rather than hoard it\); take your bodies and wear them out for the goodness of your own souls, and do not be niggardly about them because Allah, the most Glorified One, has said the following: “If you help \(yourselves and others in the way\) of Allah, He will \(also\) help you and will set your feet firm \(on His Straight Path\) \(Holy Quran, 47: 7\)\. And He, the most Sublime One, has said the following: “Who will loan unto Allah a goodly loan so that He may double it for him and for him shall be a noble recompense?” \(Holy Quran, 57: 11\)\.

He does not seek your support because of being weak, nor does He demand a loan from you because of being in need\. He seeks your help, although He possesses all the armies of the skies and of the earth, and He is strong and wise\. He seeks a loan from you, although He owns the treasures of the skies and of the earth, and He is rich and praiseworthy\. \(Rather\) He intends to try you as to which of you performs good deeds\. You should, therefore, be quick in performance of \(good\) deeds so that your way may be with His neighbors in His abode\. He made His Prophet’s companions from among these neighbors and made the angels visit them\. He has honored their ears so that the sound of Hell\-fire may never reach them, and He has afforded protection to their bodies from weariness and fatigue\.

\.\.\. That is the grace of Allah, He bestows it upon whomsoever He pleases, and Allah is the master of Mighty Grace \(Holy Quran, 57: 21\)\.

I say you hear me\. I seek Allah’s help for myself and for you\. He suffices me, and He is the best dispenser \(of bounties\)\.

**Sermon 183**

**One of the Kharijites, namely al\-Burj ibn Mus’hir at\-Ta’i, raised the call of “Command is fit for only Allah” in such a way that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) heard it\. On hearing it he said the following:**

Keep quiet, may Allah expose your ugliness, O you with the broken tooth\! Certainly, by Allah, when the truth becomes manifest, even then, your personality is weak and your voice is loose\. But when wrong began to shout loudly, you again shouted up like the \(blown\) horns of a kid\.

<a id="page634"></a>

**Sermon 184**

**Praising Allah and His Wonderful Creatures**

Praise be to Allah\! He is such that senses cannot perceive Him, place cannot contain Him, eyes cannot see Him and veils cannot cover Him\. He proves His eternity by the bringing His creation into existence and \(also\) by originating His creation\. \(He proves\) His existence, and through their spirituality, He proves that there is nothing similar to Him\. He is true to His promise\. He is too Sublime to be unjust to His creatures\. He stands by equity among His creation and implements justice over them in His commands\. He provides testimony of His own being through the creation of things from ever, through their marks of incapability of His power and through their powerlessness against death of His eternity\.

He is One, but not by counting\. He is everlasting without any limit\. He is existent without any support\. Minds admit His existence without the need for the senses\. Things which can be seen testify to Him without confronting Him\. Imagination cannot encompass Him\. He manifests Himself to the imagination with his help for the imagination, refusing to be conceived by the imagination\. He has made imagination the arbiter\. He is not “big” in the sense that volume is vast, so His body is also “big”\. Nor is He great in the sense that His limits should extend to the utmost, so His frame should be extensive\. But He is ‘big” in status and great in authority\.

**About the Holy Prophet \(h\)**

I testify that Muhammad \(h\) is His slave, His chosen Prophet \(h\) and His responsible trustee\.May Allah bless him and his

descendants\. Allah sent him with undeniable proofs, with a clear success and an open path\. So he conveyed the message, declaring the truth with it\. He led the people on the \(correct\) path, established signs of guidance and minarets of light, making Islam’s ropes strong and knots firm\.

**Part of the Same Sermon: About the Creation of Animal**

**Species**

Had they pondered over the greatness of His power and the vastness of His bounty, they would have returned to the right path and feared the punishment of the Fire\. But hearts are sick and eyes are impure\. Do they not see the small things which He has created, how He

<a id="page635"></a>strengthened their system and opened for them the hearing and the sight, making for them bones and skins? Look at the ant with its small body and delicate form\. It can hardly be seen in the corner of the eye, nor by the perception of the imagination\. Look and see how it moves on the earth and leaps at its sustenance\. It carries the grain to its hole and deposits it in its place of repose\. It collects during the summer for its winter and during strength for the period of its weakness\. Its livelihood is guaranteed and it is fed to be fit\. Allah, the Kind, does not forget it, and \(Allah the Giver\) does not deprive it, even though it may be in a dry stone or in fixed rocks\.

If you have thought about its digestive tract, in its high and low parts, the carapace of its belly, its eyes and ears in its head\.\.\., you will be amazed at its creation, and you will feel it difficult to describe it\. Exalted is He Who made it stand on its legs and erected it on its pillars \(limbs\)\. No other originator took part with Him in its origination, and no one else has any power to assist Him in its creation\. If you tread on the paths of your imagination and let it reach its extremes, it will not lead you anywhere except to the fact that the Originator of the ant is the same as He Who is the Originator of the date\-palm because everything has \(the same\) delicacy and detail, and every living being has little difference with another\.

**Creation of the Universe**

In His creation, the big, the delicate, the heavy, the light, the strong, the weak are all equal\.184 So is the sky, the air, the winds and the water\. Therefore, look at the sun, moon, vegetation, plants, water, stone, the difference of this night and day, the springing of the streams, the large number of the mountains, the height of their peaks, the diversity of languages and the variety of tongues\. Then woe unto him who disbelieves in the One who ordains, who denies the Ruler\! These believe that they are like grass for which there is no cultivator nor any maker for their own sundry shapes\. They have not relied on any argument for what they assert,

184The meaning is: If the smaller thing in creation is examined, it will be found to contain all that which is found in the biggest creatures\. Each will exhibit the same reflection of nature, workmanship and performance and the ratio of each to Allah’s might and power will be the same, whether it be as small as an ant or as big as a palm tree\. Is it not that making a small thing is easy for Him while the making of a big thing is difficult because the diversity of color, volume and quantity is just based on the dictates of His sagacity and expediency? As regarding creation itself, there is no difference among them\. Therefore, this uniformity of creation is a proof of the Oneness and Unity of the Creator\.

<a id="page636"></a>nor on any research for what they have heard\. Can there be any construction without a constructor, or any offense without an offender?

**The Wonderful Creation of the Locust**

If you wish, you can tell about the locust \(as well\)\. Allah gave it two red eyes, lighted for them two moons like pupils, made for it small ears, opened for it a suitable mouth and gave it a keen sense, gave it two teeth to cut with and two sickle\-like feet to grip with\. The farmers are afraid of it in the matter of crops\. Farmers cannot drive the locust away even though they may join together in their effort\. The locust attacks the fields and satisfies its hunger although its body is not equal to a thin finger\.

**The Glory of Allah**

Glorified is Allah before Whom everyone in the skies or on earth bows down in prostration willingly or unwillingly, submits to Him by placing his cheeks and face \(on the dust\), kneals before Him \(in obedience\) peacefully and humbly and hands over to Him full control in fear and apprehension\.

The birds are bound by His commands\. He knows the number of their feathers and their breaths\. He has made their feet stand on water and on dry land\. He has ordained their livelihoods\. He knows their species: This is the crow, this is the eagle, this is the pigeon, and this is the ostrich\. He called out every bird by its name \(while creating it\) and provided it with its livelihood\. He created heavy clouds and produced from them heavy rain, spreading it on various lands\. He drenched the earth after its dryness and grew vegetation from it after its barrenness\.

**Sermon 185**

**The Oneness of Allah\. Principles of Knowledge**

He who assigns to Him \(different\) conditions does not believe in His Oneness, nor does he who likens Him in order to grasp His reality\. He who illustrates Him does not signify Him\. He who points at Him and imagines Him does not mean Him\. Everything that is known through itself has been created, and everything that exists by virtue of other things is the effect \(of something else\)\. He works but not with the help of

<a id="page637"></a>instruments\. He fixes measures but not with the activity of thinking\. He is rich but not by acquisition\.

Times do not keep company with Him\. His Being precedes times\. His Existence precedes non\-existence, and His eternity precedes beginning\. By His creating the senses, it is known that He has no “senses”\. By the contraries in various matters, it is known that He has no contrary, and by the similarity between things, it is known that there is nothing similar to Him\. He has made light the contrary of darkness, brightness that of gloom, dryness that of moisture and heat that of cold\. He produces affection among opponents\.

He fuses together diverse things, brings near remote things and separates things which are joined together\. He is not confined to limits, nor counted by numbers\. Material parts can surround things of their own kind and organs can point out things similar to themselves\. The word mundhu \(i\.e\. since\) disproves their eternity185, the word qad \(that denotes nearness of time of occurrence\), disproves their being from ever and the word lawla \(if it were not\) keep them remote from perfection\.

Through them, the Creator manifests Himself to the intelligence, and through them He is guarded from the vision of the eyes\.

Stillness and motion do not apply to Him\. How can a thing occur in Him which He has Himself made to occur, and how can a thing revert to Him which He first created, and how can a thing appear in Him which He first brought to appearance? If it had not been so, His Self will have become subject to diversity, His Being will have become divisible \(into parts\) and His reality will have been prevented from being deemed

185The meaning here is: The words “_mundhu, qad_ and _lawla_” have been made to be the antitheses of the attributes of “ever, eternal and perfect”\. Therefore, their application to anything will prove that they have come into existence from non\-existence and are imperfect\. For example, “mundhu” is used to denote time as is “qad wujida mundhu kadha” \(this thing is found since such\-and\- such time\)\. Here, a time limit has been stated\. Anything for which a limit of time can be described cannot exist from ever or remain forever\. The word “qad” shows \(indicates the present perfect tense\) the immediate past\. This sense also can apply to a thing which is limited in time\. The word _lawla_ is used to denote the negation of something in another thing, such as “ma ahsanahu wa akmalahu lawla annahu kasha”; that is, “How beautiful and perfect it will be if it were such\-and\-such”\. Therefore, the thing for which this word is used will be in need of others to compare how handsome and perfect what it describes is, and this word will remain deficient by itself\.

<a id="page638"></a>Eternal\. If there was a front to Him there will have been a rear also for Him\. He will need completing only if shortage befell Him\. In such case, signs of the created will appear in Him and He will become a sign \(leading to other objects\) instead of signs leading to Him\. Through the might of His abstention \(from affectedness\) He is far above being affected by things which effect others\.

He is that which does not change or vanish\. The process of setting does not behoove Him\. He has not begotten anyone lest He should be regarded as having been born\. He has not been begotten; otherwise, He will be contained within limits\. He is too Sublime to have sons\. He is too purified to contact women\. Imagination cannot reach Him so as to assign Him quantity\. Understanding cannot think of Him so as to give Him shape\. Senses do not perceive Him so as to feel Him\. Hands cannot touch Him so as to rub against Him\. He does not change into any condition\. He does not pass from one state to another\. Nights and days do not turn Him old\. Light and darkness do not alter Him\.

It cannot be said that He has a limit or extremity, an end or termination, nor do things control Him so as to raise or lower Him, nor does anything carry Him so as to bend Him or keep Him erect\. He is not inside things nor outside them\. He conveys news, but not with tongue or voice\. He listens, but not with the holes of the ears or the organs of hearing\. He says but does not utter words\. He remembers, but does not memorize\. He determines, but not by exercising His mind\. He loves and approves without any sentimentality \(of heart\)\. He hates and feels angry without any painstaking\. When He intends to create someone/something He says, “Be\!”, and there he/she/it is\! But He does not do so through voice that strikes \(the ears\)\. His speech is an indication of His creation\. His like never existed “before” nor “after”\.

It cannot be said that He came into being after He had not been in existence because, in that case, the attributes of the created things will be assigned to Him and there will remain no difference between them and Him, and He will have no distinction over them\. Thus, the Creator and the created will become equal and the initiator and the initiated will be on the same level\. He created \(the whole of\) creation without any example made by someone else, and He did not secure the assistance of anyone out of His creation for creating it\.

He created the earth and suspended it without being ‘busy”, retained it without support, made it stand without legs, raised it without pillars, protected it against bending and curving and defended it against

<a id="page639"></a>crumbling and splitting \(into parts\)\. He fixed mountains on it like stumps, solidified its rocks, caused its streams to flow and opened its valleys wide\. Whatever He made did not suffer from any flow, and whatever He strengthened did not show any weakness\.

He manifests Himself over the earth with His authority and greatness\. He is aware of its inside through His knowledge and understanding\. He has power over everything on earth by virtue of His sublimity and dignity\. Nothing from the earth that He may ask for defies Him, nor does it oppose Him so as to overpower Him\. No swift\- footed creature can run away from Him so as to ahead of Him\. He is not needy towards any possessing person so that the latter should feed Him\. All things bow down to Him and are humble before His greatness\. They cannot flee away from His authority to someone else in order to escape His benefit or His harm\. There is no parallel for Him that may match Him and no one like Him so as to equal Him\.

He will destroy the earth after its existence, till all that exists on it will become non\-existent\. But the extinction of the world after its creation is no more wonderous than its first formation and invention\. How could it be? Even if all the animals of the earth, whether birds or beasts, stabled cattle or pasturing ones, of different origins and species, dull people and sagacious men\.\.\., all jointly try to create \(even\) a mosquito, they are not able to bring it into being and do not understand what is the way to its creation\. Their wits are bewildered and wandering\. Their powers fall short, fail and return disappointed and tired, knowing that they are defeated and admitting their inability to produce it, also realizing that they are too weak \(even\) to destroy it\.

Surely, after the extinction of the world, Allah, the most Glorified One, will remain alone with nothing else besides Him\. He will be, after its extinction, as He was before its production: without time or place or moment or period\. At this moment, period and time will not exist and years and hours will disappear\. There will be nothing except Allah, the One, the Almighty\. To Him is the return of all matters\. Its initial creation was not in its power, and the prevention of its extinction was \(also\) not in its power\. Had it had the power to prevent it, it would have existed forever\. When He made anything of the world, the making of it did not cause Him any difficulty and the creation of anything which He created and formed did not cause Him any fatigue\. He did not create it to heighten His authority nor for fear of loss or harm, nor to seek its help against an overwhelming foe, nor to guard against any avenging opponent with its help, nor for the extension of His domain by its help, nor for boasting

<a id="page640"></a>\(over the size of His possession\) against a partner, nor because He felt lonely and desired to seek its company\.

After its creation, He will destroy it, but not because any worry has overcome Him in its upkeep and administration, nor for any pleasure that will accrue to Him, nor for the cumbrousness of anything over Him\. The length of its life does not weary Him so as to induce Him to its quick destruction\. Allah, the Glorified One, has maintained it with His kindness, kept it intact with His command and perfected it with His power\. Then after its destruction, He will resurrect it, but not for any need of His own towards it, nor to seek the assistance of any of its things against it, nor to change over from the condition of loneliness to that of company, nor from the condition of ignorance and blindness to that of knowledge and search, nor from paucity and need towards needlessness and plenty, nor from disgrace and lowliness towards honor and prestige\.

**Sermon 186**

**Regarding the Vicissitudes of Time \(The Mischief That Is to Occur and the Absence of Lawful Ways of Livelihood\)**

May my father and mother be sacrificed for those few whose names are well\-known in the heavens while not known on the earth\! Beware, you should expect what is to befall you, such as adversity in your affairs, severance of relations and the rising up of inferior people\. This will happen when the blow of a sword will be easier for a believer than to secure one dirham lawfully\. This will happen186 when the reward of the beggar is more than that of the giver\. This will be when you are intoxicated, not by drinking, but with wealth and plenty, swearing without compulsion and speaking lies without compulsion\. This will be when troubles hurt you as the saddle hurts the hump of the camel\. How long will these tribulations be and how distant the hope \(for deliverance from them\)?

186During such a period, the reward of the beggar who takes \(charity\) will be higher than that of the giver because of the ways of earning livelihood\. Such means earned by the rich will be unlawful; so, whatever one donates of it, its purpose will be to show off, for the sake of hypocrisy and fame for which he will not be entitled to any reward, while the poor who takes it by force of the necessity of their poverty and helplessness and spend it in the right manner will deserve more reward and recompense\.

<a id="page641"></a>O people\! Throw away the reins of the horses that carry on their backs the weight of your hands have committed \(i\.e\. your sins\)\. Do not cut away from your chief \(Imam\); otherwise, you will blame yourselves for your own doings\. Do not jump in the fire which is in flames in front of you; keep away from its courses and leave the middle way for it\. Because, by my life, a believer will die in its flames while others will remain safe\.

I am among you like a lamp in the darkness\. Whoever enters by it will be lit\. So listen, O men\! Preserve it and remain attentive with the ears of your hearts so that you may understand\.

The commentator, Ibn Abul\- Hadid, has written another meaning of it: If the beggar does not take the wealth from the rich, so it remains with the latter, they will spend it on unlawful matters and enjoyments\. Since the beggar’s taking the wealth from the rich prevents the latter from using wealth for unlawful things, hence there will be prevention from evil, the beggar deserves more rewards and compensations \(Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 13, p\. 97\)\.

**Sermon 187**

**Allah’s Favors**

I admonish you, O people, to fear Allah and to praise Him abundantly for His favors unto you, for His reward for you, and \[even\] for His obligations on you\. See how He chose you for favors and dealt with you with mercy\. You sinned openly; He kept your sins covered\. You behaved in a way to incur His punishment, but He gave you more respite\.

**Condition of Persons Facing Death**

I also admonish you to remember death and to lessen your heedlessness towards it\. Why should you be heedless of the One Who is not heedless of you? Why expect from him \(i\.e\. the angel of death\) to give you a respite? The dead whom you have been watching suffice as preachers\. They were carried to their graves, not riding but transported, and were placed in their graves, but not of their own accord\. It seems as if they never lived in this world and as if the next world had always been their abode\. They have made lonely the place where they were living and are now living where they used to feel lonely\. They remained busy about what they had to leave behind them and did not care about where they were going to\. Now, they cannot remove themselves from evil, nor add to

<a id="page642"></a>their virtues\. They were attached to the world and it deceived them\. They trusted it and it overturned the tables to them\.

**Transience of this World**

May Allah have pity on you\! You should, therefore, hasten towards \(the preparation of\) houses which you have been commanded to populate, towards which you have been called upon, and to which you have been invited\. Seek the completion of Allah’s favors on you by exercising endurance in His obedience and abstention from His disobedience because tomorrow is close to today\. How fast are the hours of the day?\! How fast are the days in the month?\! How fast are the months in the years and how fast the years in one’s lifetime?\!

**Sermon 188**

**Steadfastness versus a Transient Belief**

One belief is \(conviction\) which is firm and steadfast in the hearts\. Another remains temporarily in one’s heart up to a certain period of time\. If you were to acquit \(yourselves\) before anyone, you should wait till death approaches, for that is the time limit for being acquitted\.

Migration stands as its original status\. Allah has no need for one who secretly accepts belief or one who openly does so\. Migration \(to the other world\) will not apply to any one unless he recognizes the proof \(of Allah\) on the earth\. Whoever recognizes him and acknowledges him will be a muhajir \(immigrant\) \. Istid’af \(i\.e\. freedom from the obligation of migration\) does not apply to him whom the proof \(of Allah\) reaches and he hears it and his heart preserves it\.187

187This is the interpretation of the words _muhajir_ and _mustad’af_ as mentioned in the Holy Quran: _Verily those whom the angels take away \(at the_ *time of death\), being unjust to their \(own\) selves, they \(the angels\) shall ask \(the sinning souls\): “In what state were you? They shall reply: Weakened \(*mustad’af

- *oppressed\) were we in the land; they \(angels\) will say: Was not the land of Allah vast \(enough\) for you to traverse therein? So these \(are those\) whose refuge shall be Hell, and what a bad resort it is\! Except the \(really\) weakened ones from among the men, women and children who have not in their power the means \(to escape from the unbelievers\) nor do they find the \(right\) way\. Allah will perhaps pardon them, and Allah is the Clement, the Oft\-forgiving One \(4: 97\-99\)\. *The meaning of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) here is that* hijra *\(migration\) was not only obligatory during the lifetime of the Holy Prophet \(h\),

<a id="page643"></a>**The challenge of “Ask me before you miss me” and a prediction about the Umayyads**

Certainly, our case is difficult and complicated\. No one can bear it except a believer whose heart Allah has tried with belief\. Our traditions will not be preserved except by trustworthy hearts and \(men of\) firm understanding\. O people\! Ask me before you miss me because certainly I am acquainted with the passages of the sky more than the passages of the earth, and before that mischief springs upon its feet which will trample even the nose string and destroy the wits of the people\.

Some people have explained this saying of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) to mean that by the passages of the earth he means matters of the world and by passages of the sky matters of religious law and that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) intends to say that he knows the matters of

religious law and commandments more than the worldly matters\. Thus, Ibn Maytham al\-Bahrani writes \(in Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 4, pp\. 200\-201\):\.

Allama al\-Wabari is quoted as having said that the gist of the intention of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) is this: The scope of his religious

knowledge is greater than his knowledge about matters relevant to the world\.

But taking the context into account, this explanation cannot be held as correct because this sentence \(being explained\) has been used as the cause of the sentence “Ask me before you miss me” and after it is the prediction of a rebellion\. In\-between these two, the occurrence of the sentence “I know religious matters more than worldly matters” makes the whole utterance quite disregarded because Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s challenge to ask whatever one likes is not confined to matters of the religious law only, so this sentence could be held as its cause\. After that, the prediction of the rebellion has nothing to do with matters of the

but it is a permanent obligation\. This migration is nowadays obligatory for attaining the proof of Allah and the true religion\. Therefore, if one has attained the proof of Allah and believed in it, even if he is in midst of the unbelievers of his locality, he is not duty\-bound to migrate\.

The _mustad’af_ \(weakened\) is one who is living among the unbelievers and is far from being informed of the proofs of Allah and, at the same time, he is unable to migrate in order to attain knowledge of the Signs of Allah\.

<a id="page644"></a>religious law so that it could be put forth as a proof of more knowledge of religious matters\. To ignore the clear import of the words and to interpret them in a way which does not suit the occasion, does not exhibit a correct spirit when from the context also the same meaning accrues, one which the words openly convey\. Thus, it is to give a warning about the Umayyad’s mischief that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) uttered the

statement “Ask me whatever you like because I know the paths and courses of the Divine destiny more than the passages of the earth\. So, even if you ask me about matters which are recorded in the Preserved Tablet and which concern the Divine destiny, I can tell you\. A serious mischief is to rise against me in those matters in which you should have doubt because my eyes are more acquainted with those ethereal lines which concern the occurrence of events and mischiefs than with what I know about life as it appears on earth\. The occurrence of this mischief is as certain as an object seen with the eyes\. You should, therefore, ask me about its details and about how to keep safe from it, so that you may be able to manage your defense when the time comes\.” This meaning is supported by the successive sayings of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) which

he uttered with regard to the unknown and to which future events did, indeed, testify\. Thus, Ibn Abul Hadid comments on this claim of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) as follows:

“Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s claim is also supported by his statements about future events which he uttered not once or a hundred times but continuously and successively\. From them, there remains no doubt that whatever he spoke was on the basis of knowledge and certainty, not by chance” \(Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 13, p\. 106\)\.

With regard to this saying of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), it has

already been demonstrated and explained \(in Sermon 92, Footnote 2\) that no one else dared advance such a claim, and those who made such a claim had to face only disgrace and humility\. About the prophecies made by Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), see Ibn Abul\-Hadid’s Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha,

Vol\. 7, pp\. 47\-51; judge Nurullah al\-Mar’ashi’s Ihqaq al\-Haqq \(New ed\.\), Vol\. 8, pp\. 87\-182\.

**Sermon 189**

**Importance of Fearing Allah, Desolateness of the Grave, Death of Those Who Love Ahl Al\-bayt \(x\) Similar to That of Martyrs**

I praise Him out of gratitude for His rewards and I seek His assistance in fulfilling my obligations to Him\. He has a strong host\. His dignity is grand\. I testify that Muhammad \(k\) is His slave and Prophet\.

He called \(people\) to His obedience and overpowered His enemies when fighting for His religion\. People’s joining together to falsify Him and their attempt to extinguish His light were of no avail\.

You should, therefore, be steadfast in your fear of Allah because it has a rope the knot of which is strong, its pinnacle is lofty and invulnerable\. Hasten towards death in its pangs \(by doing good deeds\) and be prepared for it before its approach because the ultimate end is the Day of Judgement\. This is enough admonishment for one who understands and suffices for a lesson for one who does not know\. What idea do you have, before reaching that end, about how narrow the grave is, about the hardship of loneliness, fear of the passage towards the next world, the pangs of fear, the shifting of ribs here and there \(due to narrowing of the grave\), the deafness of ears, the darkness of the grave, the fear of the promised punishment, the closing of the receptacle of the grave and the laying of the tomb stones?

So fear Allah, fear Allah, O servants of Allah, because the world is behaving with you in the usual way, and you and the Day of Judgement are in the same rope \(close to each other\), as though it has come with its signs, has approached with its pleas and has made you stand in its way\. It is as though it has come forward with all its quaking and has settled down with its chest on the ground while the world has parted from its people and turned them out of its lap\. It was like a day that has passed or a month that has gone by\. Its new things have become old and the fat ones have become thin\.

They are in a narrow place, in very complicated affairs and in a fire whose pain is intense, the cries are loud, the flames rise \[as high as mountains\], the sound causes a trembling, the burning is severe and abatement from all of this is quite remote\. Its fuel is burning, its threats are fearful, its hollows are hidden, its sides are dark, its vessels are aflame and everything about it is abominable\.

<a id="page646"></a>“Those who feared \(the wrath of\) their Master shall be conveyed in groups to the Garden” \(Holy Quran, 39: 73\)\. They are safe from chastisement, away from punishment and are kept aloof from the fire\. Their abode will be peaceful, and they will be pleased with their lodging and place of stay\. These are the people whose deeds in this world were pure, their eyes were tearful, their nights in this world were like days because of fearing \[Allah\], seeking \[His\] forgiveness, and their days were like nights because of feeling of loneliness and separation\. Therefore, Allah made Paradise the place of their \(eventual\) return, a reward in recompense\. They were most eligible and suitable for it \(Holy Quran, 48: 26\) in the eternal domain and everlasting bliss\.

Therefore, O servants of Allah, pay regard to all that by being mindful of which one will succeed and by ignoring which one will incur loss\. Hasten towards your death by means of your \(good\) deeds because you are bound by what you have done in the past, and you have to your credit only what \(good deeds\) you have sent before\. \(Behave in such a way\) as though the feared event \(death\) has come upon you, so you cannot return \(to do good deeds\) nor can you be cleared of evil deeds\. May Allah prompt us and you to be obedient to Him and to His Prophet \(h\), and may He forgive us and your own selves by His great mercy\.

Remain patient during trials and tribulations\. Do not move your hands and swords after the liking of your tongues, and do not make haste in matters in which Allah has not asked for haste: anyone of you who dies in his bed while having knowledge of the rights of Allah and the rights of His Prophet \(h\) and members of the Prophet’s house will die as a martyr\.

His reward is incumbent on Allah\. He is also eligible to the recompense of what good deeds he has intended to do, since his intention takes the place of drawing his sword\. Certainly, for everything there is a time and a limit\.

**Sermon 190**

**Praising Allah**

Praise be to Allah Whose praise is wide\-spread, Whose army is over\-powering and Whose dignity is grand\. I praise Him for His successive favors and great boons\. His forbearance is high, so He forgives, and He is just in whatever He decides\. He knows what is going on and what has already passed\. He crafted all creation with His knowledge and produced it with His intelligence without being limited to

<a id="page647"></a>anything, without learning \[from anyone or anything\], without following the example of any intelligent producer, without committing any mistake and without the availability of any group \(for help\)\. I testify that Muhammad \(k\) is His slave and His Messenger whom He deputed \(at a

time\) when people were collecting in the abyss and moving in bewilderment\. The reins of destruction were dragging them and the locks of malice lay fixed on their hearts\.

**Advice about fear of Allah and an account of this world and its people**

I admonish you, O servants of Allah,to fear Allah because it is a right of Allah over you; it creates your right over Allah, and that you should seek Allah’s help in it and help in \(meeting\) Allah\. Certainly, for today, fear of Allah is a protection and a shield for tomorrow \(the Day of Judgement\); it is the road to Paradise\. Its way is clear and he who treads it is the winner\. Whoever holds it must safeguards it\. It has presented itself to the people who have already passed and to those coming into being because they will need it tomorrow \(on the Day of Judgement\) \. It is then that Allah will revive His creation again, take back what He has given and take account of what He has bestowed\. How few will be those who accept it and practice it as it ought to be practiced\! They will be very few in number; they are the people who fit the description provided by Allah, the Glorified One, when He says: “And very few of My creatures are grateful\!” \(Holy Quran, 34: 13\)\.

So make haste towards it; intensify your efforts for it\. Make it a substitute for all your past \(shortcomings\) as a successor\. Make it your supporter against every opponent\. Turn your sleep into wakefulness by its help and pass your days in its company\. Make it the tool of your hearts, wash your sins with it, treat your ailments with it and hasten towards your death with it\.\.\. Learn a lesson from him who neglects it, so that others who follow it should not learn a lesson from you \(i\.e\. from your neglecting it\)\. Beware, therefore; you should take care of it and should take care of yourselves through it\.

Keep away from this world and proceed towards the next with infatuation\. Do not regard humbly one whom fear of Allah has given a high status, and do not accord a high status to him whom this world has given a high status\. Do not keep your eyes on the shining clouds of the world\. Do not listen to him who speaks of it, do not respond to him who calls you towards it, do not seek light from its glare and do not die for its precious things because its glitter is deceitful, its words are false, its

<a id="page648"></a>wealth is a liability to be looted, and its precious things are to be taken away\.

Beware\! This world attracts then turns away\. It is stubborn, refusing to go ahead\. It speaks lies, and it misappropriates\. It disowns and is ungrateful\. It is malicious and abandons \(its lovers\)\. It attracts but causes trouble\. Its condition is changing, its step shaking, its honor disgraceful, its seriousness a jest and its height is lowliness\. It is a place of plunder and pillage, ruin and destruction\. Its people are ready with their feet to drive, to overtake, then to depart\. Its routes are bewildering, its exits are baffling and its schemes end in disappointment\. Consequently, strongholds betray them, houses throw them out and cunning fails them\.

Some of them are like hocked camels, some like butchered meat, some like severed limbs, some like spilt blood, some bite their hands \(in pain\), some rub their palms \(in remorse\), some hold their cheeks on their hands \(in anxiety\), some curse their own views and some retreat from their determination\. But the time for action has gone by, and the hour of calamity has approached\. This is so while \(there is no longer\) time to escape \(Holy Quran, 38: 3\)\. Alas\! Alas\! What is been lost is lost\! What is gone is gone\! The world has passed in its usual manner\.

“So the heavens and the earth did not mourn them, nor were they given a respite” \(Holy Quran, 44: 29\)\.

**Sermon 191**

**Known as “al\-Khutbah al\-Qasi’a” \(the Sermon of Disparagement\)**

It comprises a disparagement of Satan \[Iblis\] for his vanity, his refusal to prostrate before Adam \(x\), and his being the first to display

bigotry and behave with vanity\. It contains a warning to people treading in Satan’s path\.

Praise be to Allah Who wears the apparel of Honor and Dignity and has chosen them for Himself rather than for His creation\. He has made them inaccessible and unlawful for others\. He has selected them for His own great self and has hurled a curse on him who contends with Him concerning them\.

<a id="page649"></a>**Trial by Allah, Vanity of Iblis**

Then He put His angels on trial concerning these attributes in order to distinguish those who were modest from those who were vain\. Therefore, Allah, Who is aware of whatever is hidden in the hearts and whatever lies behind the unseen, said the following: “Verily, I am about to create man from clay\. And when I have completed and breathe d into him of My spirit, prostrate to him\. And the angels, all of them, did prostrate \[to Adam\] save Iblis” \(Holy Quran, 38: 71 \- 74\)\.

His vanity stood in his \[Iblis’s\] way\! Consequently, he felt proud about Adam by virtue of his creation, boasted over him on account of his origin\. Thus, this enemy of Allah is the leader of those who boast and the fore\-runner of vanity\. It is he who laid the foundation of factionalism, quarreled with Allah about the robe of greatness, put on the outfit of haughtiness and took off the covering of humility\. Do you not see how Allah made him low on account of his vanity and humiliated him for his bid to be high? He discarded him in this world and provided for him burning fire in the next world\.

Had Allah wanted to create Adam from a light whose glare dazzles the eyes, whose handsomeness would have amazed the wits and whose smell would have caught the breath, He would have done so\. And if He had done so, people would have bowed down to him in humility, and the trial of the angels through him would have become easier\. But Allah, the Glorified One, tries His creatures by means of those things the real nature of which they do not know\. He does so in order to distinguish \(what is good from what is bad\) for them through the trial, to remove vanity from them, and to keep them away from pride and self\-admiration\.

You should learn a lesson from what Allah did with Satan\. He nullified his great deeds and extensive efforts on account of the vanity of one moment, although Satan had worshipped Allah for six thousand years

- whether by the reckoning of this world or by that of the next world is not known\. Who now can remain safe from Allah after Satan by committing a similar disobedience? None at all\. Allah, the Glorified One, will not let a human being enter Paradise if he does the same thing for which Allah turned an angel from it\. His command for the inhabitants in the sky and the earth is the same\. There is no friendship between Allah and any individual out of His creation so as to give him license for an undesirable thing which He has held unlawful for all the worlds\.

<a id="page650"></a>**Warning Against Satan**

Therefore, you should fear lest Satan should infect you with his disease or lead you astray through his call or march on you with his horsemen and footmen because, by my life, he has put the arrow in the bow for you, has stretched the bow strongly and has aimed at you from a nearby distance and: “He \(Satan\) said the following: Lord\! Because You let me stray, certainly will I adorn unto them the path of error, and certainly will I cause them all to go astray” \(Holy Quran, 15: 39\)\.

Although he \(Satan\) had said so only by guessing about the unknown future and by wrong conjecturing, yet the sons of vanity, the brothers of haughtiness and the horsemen of pride and intolerance proved him to be true, so much so that when disobedient persons from among you bowed before him and his greed about you gained strength, and what was a hidden secret turned into a clear fact\.\.\., he spread his full control over you and marched with his forces towards you\.

Then they pushed you into the hollows of disgrace, threw you into the whirlpools of slaughter and trampled on you, wounding you by striking your eyes with spears, cutting your throats, tearing your nostrils, breaking your limbs and taking you in ropes towards the fire that is already prepared\. In this way, he became more harmful to your religion and a greater kindler of flames \(of mischief\) about your worldly matters than the enemies against whom you showed open opposition and against whom you marched with your forces\.

You should, therefore, spend all your force against him and all your efforts confronting him because, by Allah, he boasted over your \(i\.e\. Adam’s\) origin, questioned your status and spoke lightly of your lineage\. He advanced on you with his army and brought his footmen towards your path\. They are chasing you from every place and they are hitting you at every finger joint\. You are not able to defend by any means, nor can you repulse them by any effort\. You are in the thick of disgrace, the ring of straitness, the field of death and the way of distress\.

You should, therefore, put out the fires of haughtiness and the flames of intolerance that are hidden in your hearts\. This vanity can exist in a Muslim only through the insinuations of Satan, his haughtiness, mischief and whisperings\. Make up your mind to be humble, to trample on egotism and self\-pride and to cast off vanity\. Adopt humility as the weapon with which you fight your enemies, Satan and his forces\. He certainly has, from every people, fighters, helpers, footmen and horsemen\.

<a id="page651"></a>Do not be like him who feigned superiority over the son of his own mother without any distinction given to him by Allah except the feeling of envy which his feeling of greatness created in him and the fire of anger that vanity kindled in his heart\. Satan blew into his nose his own vanity following which Allah gave him remorse and made him responsible for the sins of all killers up to the Day of Judgement\.

**Cautioning Against Vanity and Ignorant Boasting**

Beware\! You strove hard in rebellioning and created mischief on earth in open opposition to Allah, challenging the believers over fighting\. \(You should fear\) Allah in feeling proud; beware of your vanity and ignorant boasting over because this is the root of enmity and the design of Satan whereby he has been deceiving past people and bygone ages, with the result that they fell into the gloom of his ignorance and the hollows of his misguidance, submitting to his driving and accepting his leadership\. In this matter, the hearts of all the people were similar\. Centuries passed by, one after the other, in the same way, and there was vanity with which chests were tightened\.

**Cautioning Against Obeying Haughty Leaders and Elders**

Beware\! Beware of obeying your leaders and elders who feel proud of their achievements and boast about their lineage\. They hurled the \(liability for\) things on Allah and quarreled with Him regarding what He did with them, contesting His decree and disputing His favors\. Certainly, they are themain foundation of obstinacy, the chief pillars of mischief and the swords of pre\-Islamic boasting over fore\-fathers\. Therefore, fear Allah, do not become antagonistic to His favors on you, nor jealous of His bounty over you and do not obey the claimants \(of Islam\) whose dirty water you drink along with your clean one, whose ailments you mix with your healthiness and whose wrongs you allow to enter into your rightful matters\.

They are the foundation of vice and the linings of disobedience\. Satan has made them carriers of misguidance and the soldiers with whom he assaults men\. They are interpreters through whom he speaks in order to steal away your wits, enter into your eyes and blow into your ears\. In this way, he makes you the victim of his arrows, the treading ground of his footsteps and source of strength for his hands\. Learn from how he brought wrath, violence, chastisement and punishment on those who were vain from among the past people\. Take admonition from their lying on their

<a id="page652"></a>cheeks and falling on their sides and seek Allah’s protection from the dangers of vanity, as you seek His protection from calamities\.

**Humbleness of the Holy Prophet \(h\)**

Certainly, if Allah were to allow anyone to indulge in pride, He will have allowed it to His selected prophets and vicegerents\. But Allah, the Sublime, disliked vanity for them and likes to see them humble\. Therefore, they laid their cheeks on the ground, smeared their faces with the dust, bent down for the believers and remained humble\. Allah tried them with hunger, afflicted them with difficulty, tested them with fear and upset them with troubles\. Therefore, do not regard wealth and progeny as the criterion for Allah’s pleasure and displeasure, as you are not aware of the chances of mischief and trials during richness and power as Allah, the Glorified One, the Sublime, has said the following: “What?\! Do they think that what We aid them with wealth and children that We are hastening to them the good things? Nay\! They \(only\) do not perceive it” \(Holy Quran, 23: 55\-56\)\.

Certainly, Allah, the most Glorified One, tries His beings who are vain through His beloved persons who are humble in their eyes\.

When Musa son of Imran went to Pharaoh along with his brother Harun \(Aaron\) wearing \(coarse\) shirts of wool and holding canes in their hands, they guaranteed him retention of his country and continuity of his prestige only if he submitted\. But he said the following: “Do you not wonder at these two men guaranteeing me the continuity of my prestige and the retention of my country although you see their poverty and lowliness?\! Otherwise, why do they not have gold bangles on their wrists?\!” He said so feeling proud of his gold and collected possessions and considering wool and its cloth as nothing\.

Allah, the Glorified One, deputed His prophets to mankind\. If He had wished to open for them treasures and mines of gold and \(surround them with\) planted gardens and collect around them the birds of the skies and the beasts of the earth, He could have done so\. Had He had done so, there would have been no trial, nor recompense and no tidings \(about the affairs of the next life\)\. Those who accepted \(His message\) could not be given the recompense due after trial, and the believers could not deserve the reward for good deeds, and all these words will not have retained their meanings\. But Allah, the Glorified One, makes His Prophets firm in their determination and gives them weakness of appearance as seen by the

<a id="page653"></a>eyes, along with contentment that fills the hearts and eyes resulting from care\-freeness and with want that pains the eyes and the ears\.

Had the prophets possessed authority that could not be assaulted, or honor that could not be touched with harm or domain towards which thenecks of people would turn and the saddles of mounts could be set, it will have been very easy for people to seek lessons and quite difficult to feel vain\. They will have then accepted belief out of fear felt by them or inclination attracting them and their intention will have been the same, although their actions will have been different\. Therefore, Allah, the Glorified One, decided that people should follow His prophets, acknowledge His books, remain humble before His Greatness, act upon His commands and accept His obedience with sincerity in which there should not be an iota of anything else\. As the trial and tribulation will be stiffer, the reward and recompense, too, should be greater\.

**The Holy Ka\`ba**

Do you not see that Allah, the Glorified One, has tried all the people who came with Adam, up to the last ones in this world, with stones which yield neither benefit nor harm, which neither see nor hear? \[Yet\] He made those stones into His sacred House which He made as a place of worship for people\. He placed it in the most rugged stony part of the earth, on a highland with the least soil, among the most narrow valleys between rough mountains, soft sandy plains, springs of scanty water and scattered inhabitants, where neither camels nor horses nor cows nor sheep can prosper\.

Then He commanded Adam and his sons to turn towards it\. In this way, it became the center of their journey in seeking pasture, the rendezvous for the meeting of their beasts of burden, so that human spirits would hasten towards it from distant waterless deserts, deep and low lying valleys and scattered islands in the seas\. They shake their shoulders in humbleness, recite the slogan of having reached His audience, march with swift feet and have disheveled hair and dusted faces\. They throw their pieces of cloth on their backs\. They have marred the beauty of their faces by leaving the hair uncut as a matter of great test, severe tribulation, open trial and extreme refining\. Allah has made it a means to His mercy and an approach to His Paradise\.

If Allah, the Glorified One, had placed His sacred House and His great signs among plantations, streams, soft and level plains, plenty of trees, an abundance of fruits, a thick population, close habitats, golden

<a id="page654"></a>wheat, lush gardens, green land, watered plains, thriving orchards and crowded streets \.\.\., the amount of recompense will have decreased because of the lightness of the trial\. If the foundation on which the House is built and the stones with which it has been raised had been of green emerald and red rubies, and had therebeen brightness and glory, then this will have lessened the action of doubts in the breasts, will have dismissed the effect of Satan’s activity from the hearts and will have stopped the surging of misgivings in people\. But Allah tries His servants with means of different troubles\. He wants them to render worship through hardship and involves them in distress, all in order to extract vanity from their hearts, to settle down humbleness in their spirits and to make all this an open door for His favors and an easy means for His forgiveness \(of their sins\)\.

**Cautioning Against Rebellion and Oppressiveness**

\(Fear\) Allah from the immediate consequence of rebellion and the eventual consequence of weighty oppressiveness \(to accrue in the next world\) and from the evil result of vanity\. Vanity is the great trap of Satan and his big deceit which enters the hearts of the people as fatal poison does\. It is never wasted, nor does ti miss anyone, neither the learned on account of their knowledge, nor the destitute in their rags\. This is the thing against which Allah has protected His believing servants by means of prayers and alms\-giving and suffering the hardship of fasting in the days in which it has been made obligatory, in order to provide their limbs with peacefulness, to cast fear in their eyes, to humble their spirits, to give their hearts humility and to remove haughtiness from them\. All this is achieved through the covering of their delicate cheeks with dust in humility, prostrating their limbs on the ground in humbleness and retracting their bellies so as to reach to their backs due to fasting by way of lowliness \(before Allah\), besides giving all sorts of products of the earth to the needy and the destitute by way of alms\.

Look what these deeds contain of curbing the appearance of pride and suppressing the traces of vanity\. I cast my glance and noticed that no one in the world, except you, feel vanity for anything without a cause which may appeal to the ignorant, or a reason which may cling to theminds of the fools because you feel vanity for something for which no reason is discernable, nor any ground\.

As for Satan, he felt proud about Adam because of his origin and taunted at him about his creation\. He said, “I am created of \[smokeless\] fire whereas you are created of clay\.” Likewise, the rich among the prosperous communities have been feeling vanity because of their riches,

<a id="page655"></a>as \(Allah\) said the following: ‘And they said, ‘We are more \(than you\) in wealth and in children, and we shall not be chastised’” \(Holy Quran, 34: 35\)\.

**Enthusiasm for Attractive Manners, Respectable Status and Taking Lessons from the Past**

In case you cannot avoid vanity, your vanity should be for good qualities, praiseworthy deeds and admirable merits with which the dignified and noble chiefs of the Arab families distinguished themselves\. Such merits include attractive manners, high thinking, respectable status and commendable feats\. You, too, should show vanity in praiseworthy habits like protection of the neighbor, fulfillment of agreements, obedience of the virtuous, opposition to the haughty, extending generosity to others, abstention from dissension, keeping aloof from bloodshed, doing justice to people, suppressing anger and avoiding trouble on earth\. You should also fear what calamities befell nations before you on account of their evil deeds and detestable conduct\. Remember, during good or bad times, what happened to them and be cautious lest you should become like them\.

After you have thought over the conditions of these people, attach yourself to everything with which their status became honorable, on account of which enemies kept away from them, thus safety spread over them, by reason of which riches bowed before them and, as a result, distinction connected itself to their rope\. These things were: abstention from division, sticking to unity, calling each other to it and advising each other about it\. You should avoid everything which broke those nations’ backbone and weakened their power, such as malice in the heart, hatred in the chest, turning away \(from each other’s help\) and abstaining from one another’s assistance\.

Think about the condition of people from among the believers who passed by before you\. What distresses and trials they were in\! Were they not the most over\-burdened among all the people and in the most strained circumstances in the whole world? The Pharaohs took them as slaves\. They inflicted on them the worst punishments and bitter sufferings\. They continuously remained in this state of ruinous disgrace and severe subjugation\. They found no method for escape and no way for protection\. Allah, the Glorified One, noticed that they were enduring troubles in His love and bearing distresses out of fear of Him, He provided escape routes from the distress of trials\. So, He changed their disgrace into honor and fear into safety\. Consequently, they became

<a id="page656"></a>ruling kings and conspicuous leaders\. Allah’s favors over them reached limits to which their own wishes had not reached\.

See how they were when their groups were united, their views were unanimous, their hearts were moderate, their hands used to help one another, their swords were intended for assisting one another, their visions were sharp, and their aims were uniform\. Did they not become masters of the corners of earth and rulers over the necks of all the worlds? Thereafter, also see what happened to them towards the end when division overtook them, unity became fractured and differences arose between their words and hearts\. They divided into various groups and were scattered fighting among themselves\. Then Allah took away from them the apparel of His honor and deprived them of the prosperity produced by His favors\. Only their stories have remained among you for the guidance of those who may learn lessons from them\.

You should learn a lesson from the fate of the progeny of Isma’il, the children of Isaac and the children of Israel\. How similar their affairs and how akin their examples are\! With regard to the details of their division and disunity, think of the days when Kisras of Persia and the Caesars of Rome had become their masters\. They turned them out of their pastures, the rivers of Iraq and the fertility of the world, towards thorny forests, the passages of \(hot\) winds and hardships in livelihood\. In this way, they turned them into just camel herders\. Their houses were the worst in the world and their places of stay were the most drought \-stricken\. There was not one single voice towards which they could turn for protection, nor any shade of affection on whose strength they could place their trust\.

Their condition was full of distress\. Their energies were scattered\. They were mostly divided, disunited\. They were in great anguish and in pathetic ignorance\. They buried their daughters alive, worshipped idols, disregarded kinship and practiced robbery\.

Now, look at the various favors of Allah upon them\! He deputed to them a Prophet \(k\) who got them to pledge their obedience to him and

made them unite under his call\. \(Look\) how \(Allah’s\) bounty spread the wings of its favors over them and streams of its blessing flowed for them; the whole community became wrapped in blissful prosperity\. Consequently, they were submerged under its bounty and enjoyed its lush life\. Their affairs were settled under the protection of a powerful ruler\. Circumstances offered them lofty honor, and all things became easy for them within one united and strong country\. They became rulers over the

<a id="page657"></a>world and kings in the \(various\) parts of earth\. They became masters of those who were formerly their masters and began issuing commands over those who used to command them\. They were so strong that neither their spears needed testing nor did their weapons have any flaw\.

**Condemning His People**

**Beware\! You have shaken your hands loose from the rope of obedience and broken the Divine fort around you by \(resorting to\)**

jahili \(pre\-Islamic\) customs\. Certainly, it is a great blessing of Allah, the Glorified One, that He has promoted among them unity through the cord of affection in whose shade they walk and are sheltered\. This is a blessing the value of which none in the whole world realizes because it is more valuable than any price and more precious than any material wealth\.

You should know that you have again reverted to the status of bedouin Arabs after migration \(to Islam\) and have become different parties after having been once united\. You do not possess anything of Islam except its name and know nothing of belief except its outer cover\. You say, “The Fire, yes, but no shameful status,” as if you will throw down Islam on its face in order to defame its honor and break its pledge \(of brotherhood\) which Allah gave you as a sacred trust on His earth and \(a source of\) peace among the people\. Rest assured that if you incline towards anything other than Islam, the unbelievers will fight you\. Then there will be neither Gabriel nor Michael, neither Muhajirun nor Ansar to help you, only the clashing of swords, till Allah settles the matter for you\.

Certainly, there are examples before you of Allah’s wrath, punishment, days of tribulations and serious events\. Therefore, do not disregard His promises, ignoring His punishment, underestimating His wrath and not expecting His violence\. Allah, the Glorified One, did not curse the past generations except because they had forsaken enjoining others to do good deeds and to refrain from doing bad deeds\. In fact, Allah cursed the foolish ones for committing sins and the wise for giving up on curbing others from committing evil deeds\. Beware\! You have broken the shackles of Islam, transgressed its limits and destroyed its commands\.

<a id="page658"></a>**Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib’s High Status and Wonderful Deeds in Islam**

Beware\! Surely Allah has commanded me to fight those who rebellion or break their pledge or create trouble in the land\. As regarding pledge\-breakers, I have fought them\. As regarding those who shrunk from the truth, I have waged a holy war against them\. And as regarding those who have abandoned the creed, I have put them in \(serious\) disgrace\. As for Satan of the Pit, he, too, has been dealt with by me through the loud cry with which the scream of his heart and shaking of his chest was also heard\. Only a small portion of the rebels has remained\. If Allah allows me one more chance over them I will annihilate them except a few remnants that may remain scattered in the suburb of the cities\.

Even in my boyhood, I had lowered the chest of \(famous men\) of Arabia and broken the horn points \(i\.e\. defeated the chiefs\) of the tribes of Rabi\`ah and Mudar\. Certainly, you know my status of close kinship and special relationship with the Prophet of Allah \(k\)\. When I was only a

child, he took charge of me\. He used to press me to his chest and put me beside him in his bed, bringing his body close to mine and letting me smell his fragrance\. He used to chew something then feed me with it\. He found no lie in my speech, nor weakness in any deeds\.

From the time of my weaning, Allah had put a mighty angel with the Prophet \(k\) to take him along the path of high character and good

behavior through the day and the night, while I used to follow him like a young camel following in the footprints of its mother\. Every day, he would show me in the form of a banner some of his high traits, commanding me to follow it\. Every year he used to go in seclusion to the hill of Hira’, where I saw him but no one else saw him\. In those days, Islam was not recognized in any house except that of the Prophet of Allah \(k\) and Khadija, while I was the third after these two\. I used to see and

watch the glory of the Divine revelation and message, and I breathed the scent of Prophethood\.

When the revelation descended on the Prophet of Allah \(k\), I

heard the moan of Satan\. I said, “O Prophet of Allah\! What is this moaning?” He replied, “This is Satan who has lost all hope of being worshipped\. O Ali\! You see all that I see and hear all that I hear, except that you are not a prophet; you are a vicegerent and you are surely on \(the path of\) virtue\.”

<a id="page659"></a>I was with him when a party of the tribesmen of Quraish came to him and said, “O Muhammad\! You have made a big claim which none of your forefathers or those of your family has made\. We ask you one thing; if you give us an answer to it and show it to us, we will believe that you are a prophet and a messenger, but if you cannot do it, we will know that you are a sorcerer and a liar\.” The Messenger of Allah said the following: “What do you ask for?” They said, “Ask this tree to move towards us, even with its roots and stop before you\.” The Prophet \(h\) said, “Verily,

Allah has power over everything\. If Allah does it for you, will you then believe and testify to the truth?” They said, “Yes\.” Then he said, “I shall show you whatever you want, but I know that you will not bend towards virtue, and there are among you those who will be thrown into the pit and those who will form parties \(against me\)\.” Then the Holy Prophet \(h\)

said the following: “O tree\! If you do believe in Allah and in the Day of Judgement and know that I am the Prophet of Allah, come up with your roots and stand before me with the permission of Allah\.” By the One Who deputed the Prophet \(h\) with the truth, the tree did remove itself with its

roots and came with a great humming sound and a flapping like the flapping of the wings of birds, till it stopped before the Messenger of Allah while some of its twigs came down onto my shoulders and I was on the right side of the Holy Prophet \(h\)\.

When the people saw this, they said by way of pride and vanity, ‘Now you order half of it to come to you and the other half of it to remain \(in its place\)\.” The Holy Prophet \(h\) ordered the tree to do the same\. Half of the tree advanced towards him in an amazing manner and with a grater humming\. It was about to touch the Prophet of Allah \(k\)\. Then they said in their disbelief and rebellion, “Ask this half to get back to its other half and be as it was\.” The Prophet \(h\) ordered it and it returned\.

Then I said, “O Prophet of Allah\! I am the first to believe in you and to acknowledge that the tree did what it did just now with the command of Allah, the Sublime One, in testimony to your Prophethood and to strengthen your word\.” Upon this all the people shouted, ‘Rather a sorcerer, a liar, you are\! This is wonderful sorcery\! He is very adept in it\. Only a youth like this \(pointing to me\) can stand testimony to you in your affairs\.”

Certainly, I belong to the group of people who care not for the reproach of anybody in matters concerning Allah\. Their countenance is the countenance of the truthful and their speech is the speech of the virtuous\. They are wakeful during the nights \(in devotion to Allah\) and

<a id="page660"></a>over beacons \(of guidance\) in the day\. They hold fast to the rope of the Holy Quran, revive the traditions of Allah and of His Prophet \(h\)\. They

do not boast nor indulge in self\-conceit, nor misappropriate, nor create mischief\. Their hearts are in Paradise while their bodies are busy in \(good\) deeds\.

The intention above is: “You should not create conditions because of which you may be deprived of Allah’s favors, like the jealous who aims at harming one of whom he is jealous\.”

There is also the intention above that if belief is accepted by force, and if worship is offered under pressure by some power or authority, neither will it be belief in the true sense nor worship in the real spirit\. This is so because belief is an inner testimony and a heartfelt conviction\. The conviction produced by force and compulsion can only be verbal, not heartfelt\. Similarly, worship is the name of open acknowledgment of one’s status of servitude\. Worship devoid of the feeling of servitude or the sense of devotion performed only out of fear cannot be real worship\. Therefore, such belief and such worship will not present their correct connotation\.

The reason for the Imam \(x\) specifying the learned and the poor,

as indicated above, is that the learned person has the light of learning to lead him\. The destitution of the poor may be a hindrance\. In spite of this, both the learned and the poor may fall prey to one’s deceit\.

How can the ignorant person save himself from Satan’s clutches, and how can the rich person, who has all the means to get into wrong ways, defend himself against him?

Nay\! Verily man is wont to rebel\!

As he deems himself needless\!

If a glance is cast at the rise and fall as well as the events of the past nations, this fact will shine like daylight: The rise and fall of communities is not the result of luck or change\. To a great extent, it is affected by their actions\. Whatever type those actions may be, their outcomes and consequences are in accord with them\. Consequently, the stories and events of past peoples openly reflect the fact that the result of oppression and evil deeds has always been ruin and destruction, while the consequence of a virtuous action and peaceful living was always good fortune and success\. Since time immemorial, people make no difference,

<a id="page661"></a>if the same conditions appear again and again, the same actions are repeated, the same results must accrue which had appeared in the earlier set of circumstances\. The accrual of the results of good or bad actions is sure and certain like the properties and effects of everything\. If this were not so, it would not be possible to kindle hope in the minds of the oppressed and the afflicted by presenting to them past events and their respective effects, nor could the oppressors and tyrants be warned of the ill effects of their own misdeeds on the ground that it was not necessary that the same will accrue now as had accrued before\. But it is the universality of causes which makes past events the object of a lesson for posterity\. Consequently, it was for this purpose that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) provoked thinking and consideration, stating the various events

of Banu Isma’il, Banu Ishaq and Banu Isra’il and their being afflicted at the hands of the kings of Persia and Rome\.

The progeny of Isma’il, the elder son of Ibrahim \(Abraham\), is called Banu Isma’il, while the progeny of his younger son, Isaac, is called Banu Ishaq which later continued to divide into various off\-shoots and acquired different names\. Their original abode was at Canaan, Palestine, where Ibrahim had settled after the migration from the plains of the Euphrates and the Tigris\. His son Isma’il had settled in Hijaz, where Ibrahim had left him and his mother Hajar \(Hagar\) \. Isma’il married Sayyidah daughter of Mudad, a woman from the tribe of Jurhum which also inhabited this area\. His progeny sprang from her and spread elsewhere\. The other son of Ibrahim, namely Ishaq, remained in Canaan\. His son was Ya\`qub \(Jacob, or Israel\) who married Liya the daughter of his maternal uncle brother and after her death married his uncle’s other daughter\. Both of them bore his progeny which is known as Banu Isra’il\. One of his sons was Yusuf \(Joseph\) who reached the neighboring country, Egypt, through an accident and, after suffering slavery and imprisonment, eventually he won a high position in the then government of a just Egyptian king\.

After this change, Yusuf sent for all his family and relatives to join him\. Thus, Egypt became the new abode of Banu Isra’il\. For some time, they lived there in peace and security, leading a respectable life\. But by and by, the locals began to view them with disdain and hatred, making them the target of all sorts of tyrannies, so much so that they used to kill their children and let their women live as their bondmaids, as a result of which their determination and courage were trampled upon, their spirit of freedom was completely subdued\. At last, conditions changed and the period of their troubles came to an end after four hundred years of the shackles of slavery\. This happened when Allah sent Musa to deliver them

<a id="page662"></a>from the oppression of Pharaoh\. Musa set off with them to leave Egypt\. In order to destroy Pharaoh, Allah turned them towards the Nile\. Thus, the mighty river was in front and behind them were the huge forces of Pharaoh\. This terrified them a great deal, but Allah commanded Musa to strike the river with his cane, causing a dry pathway therein\. Thus, when he advanced, there appeared in the river not only one but several courses to pass through\. Musa crossed to the other side of the river along with Banu Isra’il\. Pharaoh was closely following\. When he saw them passing, he, too, advanced with his army\. But when they reached the middle of the Nile, the water engulfed Pharaoh and his army in its waves, finishing them\. About them, the Holy Quran says the following: “And \(remember\) when We delivered you from Pharaoh’s people who afflicted you with grievous torment, slaying your sons and letting your women live, and in that there was a great trial from your Master” \(2: 49\)\.

Having left the boundaries of Egypt, they entered their motherland, Palestine, established their own state and began to live in freedom\. Allah changed their lowliness and disgrace into the greatness and sublimity of rule and power\. In this regard, Allah says the following:

“And We made the people who were deemed weak inherit the eastern parts of the earth and the western parts of it which we had blessed the rein \(with fertility\), and the good word of your Lord was fulfilled in the children of Israel for what they did endure, and We destroyed what Pharaoh and his people had wrought and what shade they made” \(Holy Quran, 7: 137\)\.

On gaining power and regaining prosperity and security, Banu Isra’il forgot all the ignominy and disgrace of the period of slavery\. Instead of being thankful to Allah for the favors which He granted them, they took to rebellion and rebellion\. Consequently, they shamelessly indulged in vices and misconduct, partaking in mischief and evil deeds to the maximum\. They made lawful things which are unlawful and vice versa by false excuses\. They disobeyed the prophets who tried to preach and correct them under the command of Allah and even killed them\. The natural consequence of their vicious activities was that they were caught in punishment for their deeds\. Nebuchadnezzar, who was ruling Babylon \(in nowadays’ Iraq\) in 600 B\.C\. rose to power against Syria and Palestine and killed seventy thousand of Banu Isra’il with his blood \-thirsty swords\. He devastated their towns, drove away the survivors with him like sheep and goats and threw them in the abyss of ignominy by turning them into slaves\. Although after this ruination there seemed no way for them to regain status and power, nature gave them still another chance to recover\.

<a id="page663"></a>When Nebuchadnezzar died and power came in the hands of Belshazzar, one of their own, the latter started all sorts of oppression on the people\. Being disgusted with this, they sent word to the ruler of Persia that they were tired of enduring the oppression of their ruler and that he should rescue them from him and free them from the oppression of Belshazzar\. Cyrus the Great, who was a just and upright ruler, rose up in response to this request and, with the cooperation of the local population, overturned the government, as a consequence of which the yoke of slavery on the necks of Banu Isra’il was also removed, and they were allowed to return to Palestine\. Thus, after seventy years of subjugation, they again set foot in their homeland and took over the reins of government\. If they had taken their lesson from the past events, they would not have committed the same evils as a consequence of which they had to suffer slavery\. But the mental constitution of his community was such that whenever they achieved of prosperity and freedom from care, they lost themselves in the intoxication of riches and in the enjoyment of pleasure, mocked the laws of religion, derided the prophets and even killed them; all these vices did not mean anything to them\. Thus, when their ruler, Herod, at the request of his sweetheart \[Shalomy\], beheaded Prophet Yahya \(John the Baptist\) and presented his head to her, none of them raised any voice against this brutality or was affected by it in any manner\. This was the state of their unruliness and fierce nature when Isa made his appearance\. He stopped them from committing evil deeds and exhorted them to adopt good customs, but they opposed him, too, and gave him troubles of various sorts, so much so that they even tried to end his life\. However, Allah foiled all their plots and made Isa safe against their mischief\. When their disobedience reached this stage and their capacity to accept guidance was completely wiped out, fate decided to ruin them and make full arrangements for their annihilation and destruction\. The ruler of Byzantine Rome, Vespasianus, sent his son, Titus, to attack Syria\. He laid a siege around Jerusalem, demolished houses and broke down the walls of the synagogues as a result of which thousands of Banu Isra’il left their homes and became scattered abroad, while thousands died of hunger\. Those who remained were put to death\. Most of them settled in Hijaz\. Because of their rejection of Prophet Muhammad \(h\), their unity was so

disturbed that they could never again converge on any one center of honor and could never regain a life of prestige and dignity in place of disgrace and ignominy\.

In the same way, the ruler of then Persia made serious attacks on Arabia and subjugated the inhabitants of those areas\. Thus, Shahpur son of Hormuz, at the age of sixteen, took with him four thousand combatants and attacked the Arabs who resided within the boundaries of Persia then

<a id="page664"></a>advanced towards Bahrain, Qatif and Hajar and ruined Banu Tamim, Banu Bakr ibn Wa’il and Banu Abdul\-Qays, cutting through the shoulders of seventy thousand Arabs, earning the nickname “Dhul\-Aktaf” \(the man of the shoulders\)\. He forced the Arabs to live in tents of woven animal hair, grow long hair on their heads, not wear white clothes and ride unsaddled horses\. Then he settled twelve thousand people of Isfahan and other cities of Peria in the area between Iraq and Syria\. In this way, he drove the inhabitants of those areas from fertile lands to waterless forests which had neither conveniences of life nor means of livelihood\. For long, these people remained the victims of others’ oppression due to their own disunity and division\. At last, Allah deputed the Prophet \(h\) and raised

them out of disgrace to the highest pinnacle of progress and sublimity\.

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), Abu Ayyub al\-Ansari, Jabir ibn Abdullah al\-Ansari, Abdullah ibn Mas\`ud, \`Ammar ibn Yasir, Abu Sa’id al\-Khudri and Abdullah ibn Abbas narrated that the Holy Prophet \(h\) commanded Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) to fight those who were pledge\-

breakers \(nakithin\), deviators from truth \(qasitin\) and those who had reneged from the faith \(mariqin\)\. See the following references for this fact: Al\-Mustadrak, Vol\. 3, p\. 139; Al\-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 3, p\. 1117; Usd al\-Ghaba, Vol\. 3, pp\. 32\-33; Al\-Durr al\-Manthur, Vol\. 6, p\. 18; Al\-Khasa’is al\-Kubra, Vol\. 2, p\. 138; Majma’ al\-Zawa’id, Vol\. 5, p\. 186; Vol\. 6, p\. 235; Vol\. 7, p\. 238; Kanz al\-Ummal, Vol\. 6, pp\. 72,82,88,155,215,319,391,392; Tarikh Baghdad, Vol\. 8, p\. 340; Vol\. 13,

1. 186\-187; Tarikh, Ibn Asakir, Vol\. 5, p\. 41; Tarikh, Ibn Kathir, Vol\. 7, pp\. 304\-306; Al\-Riyad al\-Nadira, Vol\. 2, p\. 240; Sharh al\-Mawahib al\-Ladunniyya, Vol\. 3, pp\. 316\-317; Sharh al\-Mawaddat al\-Awham, Vol\. 1, p\. 386\)\.

Ibn Abul\-Hadid says, “It has been proven \(by right ascription\) from the Holy Prophet \(h\) that he said the following to Ali \(x\): “You

will fight after me those who are pledge\-breakers, deviators from the truth and those who have gone out of the faith\.”

The pledge\-breakers were the people of Jamal because they broke their allegiance to him\. The deviators from the truth were the people of Syria at Siffin\. Those who reneged from the faith were the Kharijites at an\-Nahrawan\. Regarding these three groups, Allah says \(about the first one\): “Verily, those who swear their fealty to you do swear fealty to Allah; the hand of Allah is above their hands; so, whosoever violates his oath violates it only to the harm of his \(own\) self” \(Holy Quran, 48: 10\)\. About the second group Allah says the following: “As for the deviators,

<a id="page665"></a>they shall be the fuel of hell” \(Holy Quran, 72: 15\)\. Concerning the third group, Ibn Abul\-Hadid has referred to the following tradition \(hadith\) that al\-Bukhari \(in Sahih, Vol\. 4, pp\.166\-167, 243\), Muslim \(in Sahih, Vol\. 3,

1. 109\-117\), al\-Tirmidhi \(in Jami’al\-Sihah, Vol\. 4, p\. 481\), Ibn Majah \(in Al\-Sunan, Vol\. 1, pp\. 59\-62\), al\-Nisa’i \(in Al\-Sunan, Vol\. 3, pp\. 65\-66\), Malik ibn Anas \(in Al\-Muwatta’, pp\. 204\-205\), al\-Dar Qutni \(in Al\-Sunan, Vol\. 3, pp\. 131\-132\), ad\-Darmi \(in Al\-Sunan, Vol\. 2, p\. 133\), Abu Dawud \(in Al\-Sunan, Vol\. 4 pp\.241\-246\), al\-Hakim \(in Al\-Mustadrak, Vol\. 2, pp\. 145\-154; Vol\. 4, p\.531\), Ahmed ibn Hanbal \(in Al\-Musnad, Vol\. 1, pp\. 88,140,147; Vol\. 3, pp\.56,65\) and al\-Bayhaqi \(in Al\-Sunan al\-Kubra, Vol\. 8, pp\.170\-171\) have narrated through a group of the companions of the Holy Prophet \(h\) that he said the following about

Dhul\-Khuwaysira \(the surname for hu’th\-Thudayyah Hurqus ibn Zuhayr at\-Tamimi, the chief of the Kharijites\): “From this very person’s posterity, there will rise people who will recite the Holy Quran, but it will not go beyond their throat; they will kill the followers of Islam and will spare the idol\-worshippers\. They will glance through the teachings of Islam as hurriedly as the arrow passes through its prey\. If I were to ever find them, I would kill them like Ad\.”

Then ibn Abul\-Hadid goes on to say the following: “This is the sign for his \(Holy Prophet’s\) Prophethood and prediction of the secret knowledge \(Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 13, p\.183\)\.

There is a reference above to “satan of the pit”\. This is a reference to Dhu’t\-Thudayyah \(whose full name is already mentioned in a footnote above\) who was killed during the battle of Nahrawan by the stroke of lightning from the sky, so there was no need to kill him by the sword\. The Holy Prophet \(h\) had predicted the way how he would die\. Therefore,

after the annihilation of the Kharijites at Nahrawan, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) came out in hot pursuit but could not find his body anywhere\. In

the meantime, ar\-Rayyan ibn Sabirah saw forty to fifty bodies in a pit on the bank of the Nahrawan canal\. When they were taken out \[to be identified\], the body of Dhul\-Thudayya was found among them\. He was called Dhul\-Thudayya because of a mass of flesh on his shoulder \[which looked like a small breast\]\. When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) saw the

man’s body, he said, “Allah is Great\! Neither I spoke a lie nor was I told wrong” \(Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 13, pp\. 183\-184; al\-Tabari, Vol\. 1, pp\.3383 \- 3384; Ibn al\-Athir, Vol\. 3, p\.348\)\.

<a id="page666"></a>

**Sermon 192**

**It is related that a companion of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)**

**called Hamman188, who was a man devoted to worship, and said to him, “O Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib\! Describe to me the pious men in such a way as though I see them\.” Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) replied**

**saying: **“Hamman\! Fear Allah and do good deeds because “Verily, Allah\_\_ \_\_is

with those who guard \(themselves against evil\) and those who do good \(to others\)” \(Holy Quran, 16: 128\)\. But Hamman was not satisfied with this answer and pressured the Imam to provide more details\. Thereupon, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) praised Allah and extolled Him

and sought His blessings on the Holy Prophet \(h\) then said the following:

Allah, the most Glorified One, the Sublime, created everything and everyone\. He created them without any need for their obedience\. The sin of any sinner does not harm Him, nor does the obedience of anyone who obeys Him benefit Him\. He has distributed among them their livelihood and has assigned for them their positions in the world\.

Thus, the God\-fearing, in this world are the people of distinction\. Their speech is to the point, their clothing is moderate and their gait is humble\. They keep their eyes closed to what Allah has made unlawful for them, and they put listen to the knowledge which is beneficial to them\. They remain calm during the time of trials\. If there had not been fixed periods \(of life\) ordained for each one of them, their spirits would not have remained in their bodies even for the twinkling of an eye because of \(their\) eagerness for the reward \[awaiting them in the Hereafter\] and fear of chastisement\. The greatness of the Creator is seated in their heart and; so, everything else appears small in their eyes\. Thus, to them, Paradise is as though they see it and are enjoying its bliss\. To them, Hell is also as if they see it and are suffering from its punishment\.

Their hearts are grieved, they are protected against evils, their bodies are thin, their needs are scanty and their souls are chaste\. They endure \(hardship\) for a short while; consequently, they secure comfort for a long time\. It is a beneficial transaction that Allah made easy for them\.

1. According to ibn Abul\-Hadid, this is a reference to Hamman ibn Shurayh, but _allama_ al\-Majlisi says that apparently this is Hamman ibn Abadah\.

<a id="page667"></a>The world wants them, but they do not want it\. It captured them, but they freed themselves from it with a ransom\.

During the night, they are up standing on their feet reading portions of the Holy Quran and reciting it in a well\-measured way, creating through it grief for themselves and seeking by it the cure for their ailments\. If they come across a verse which creates eagerness \(for Paradise\), they pursue it avidly, and their spirits turn towards it eagerly, and they feel as if it is in front of them\. And when they come across a verse which inspires fear \(of Hell\), they bend the ears of their hearts towards it and feel as though the sound of Hell and its cries are reaching their ears\. They bend their backs, prostrate on their foreheads, palms, knees and toes, beseeching Allah, the Sublime, for their deliverance\. During the day, they endure, learn and remain virtuous and God \-fearing\. Fear \(of Allah\) has made them thin like arrows\. If any one looks at them, he believes they are sick, although they are not sick at all, and he would say that they have lost their sanity\. In fact, a great concern \(i\.e\. fear\) has made them look like that\.

They are not satisfied with \[what they consider as\] their minor good deeds and do not regard their major deeds as great\. They always blame themselves and are afraid of their deeds\. When anyone of them is spoken of highly, he says the following: “I know myself better than others and my Master knows me better than I know\. O Allah\! Do not deal with me according to what they say, make me better than they think of me and forgive me \(my shortcomings\) which they do not know\.”

The peculiarity of any of them is that you would see that he has strength in religion, determination along with leniency, faith with conviction, eagerness in \(seeking\) knowledge in forbearance, moderation when rich, devotion in worship, gracefulness in hunger, endurance in hardship, desire for what is lawful, pleasure with guidance and hatred for greed\. He performs virtuous deeds but still feels alert\. In the evening, he is anxious to offer thanks \(to Allah\)\. In the morning his anxiety is to remember \(Allah\)\. He fearfully passes his night in adoration and rises in the morning in joy \- fear lest night is passed in forgetfulness, and joy over the favor and mercy which he is sure to receive\. If his soul refuses to endure a thing which it does not like, he does not grant its request towards what it does like\. The coolness of his eye lies in what is to last forever, while from the things \(of this world\) that would not last he keeps aloof\. He transfuses knowledge with forbearance and speech with action\.

<a id="page668"></a>You would see his hopes simple, his shortcomings few, his heart fearing, his spirit contented, his meal small and simple, his religion safe, his desires dead and his anger suppressed\. Only goodness is expected from him\. Evil from him is not to be feared\. Even if he is found among those who forget \(Allah\), he is counted among those who remember \(Him\)\. But if he is among those who remember, he is never counted among the forgetful\. He forgives whoever is unjust to him, and he gives whoever deprives him\. He behaves well with whoever behaves ill towards him\.

Indecent speech is far from him; his utterance is lenient, his evils are non\-existent, his virtues are ever present, his goodness precedes him, and mischief turns away from him\. He is dignified during calamities, patient in distresses and thankful in ease\. He does not commit excesses against anyone whom he may hate and does not commit sin for the sake of one who loves him\. He admits the truth before testimony is brought against him\. He does not misappropriate what is placed in his custody and does not forget what he is required to remember\. He does not call others bad names, he does not cause harm to his neighbor, he does not feel happy at others’ misfortunes, he does not enter into wrong and does not go out of right\.

If he is silent, his silence does not grieve him\. If he laughs, he does not raise his voice and if he is wronged he endures till Allah takes revenge on his behalf\. His own “nafs” is in distress because of his own demeanor, while the people are in ease from him\. He exposes himself to hardship for the sake of his Hereafter while letting people feel safe from him\. His keeping away from others is asceticism and purification, while his nearness to those to whom he feels close is out of his own kindness and gentleness\. His keeping away from others is not out of vanity or arrogance, nor is his nearness to them is flattery or for deception\.

It is related that Hamman passed into a deep swoon then expired\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said the following: “Verily, by Allah, I had

this fear about him\.” Then he added: “Effective advice produces such effects on receptive minds\.” Someone189 said to him, “O Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib\! How is it you do not receive such an effect?” Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) replied: “Woe unto you\! For death there is a fixed hour

189This man was Abdullah ibn al\-Akwa’ who was in the fore\-front of the Kharijite movement and was a great opponent of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\.

<a id="page669"></a>which cannot be exceeded and a cause which does not change\. Now look, never repeat such talk which Satan had put on your tongue\.”

**Sermon 193**

**Describing the Hypocrites**

We praise Allah for the succor which He has given us in carrying out the obligations of being obedient to Him and in preventing us from disobedience\. We ask Him to complete His favors \(to us\) and to make us hold on to His rope\. We testify that Muhammad \(h\) is His slave and

Messenger\. He entered every hardship in pursuit of Allah’s pleasure and endured for its sake every grief\. His near relatives changed their attitudes towards him, and those who were distant \(in kinship\) united against him\. The Arabs let loose the reins \(of their horses to quicken their march\) against him and struck the bellies of their mounts to fightt him, so much so that enemies came to his threshold from the remotest places and most distant areas\.

I admonish you, O servants of Allah, to fear Allah, and I warn you of the hypocrites because they themselves are misguided and have misguided others as well\. They have slipped and will cause others to slip, too\. They change into many colors and adopt various ways\. They support you with all means but lie in ambush for you at every post\. Their hearts are sick while their faces look clear\. They walk stealthily and tread like the approach of sickness \(over the body\)\. Their words speak of cure, but their deeds are like incurable diseases\. They are jealous of ease; they intensify distress and destroy hopes\. Their victims are found lying in ambush on every path, while they have means to approach every heart\. They have \(false\) tears for every grief\.

They eulogize each other and expect rewards from each other\. When they ask something, they insist on it\. If they reprove \(any one\), they disgrace \(him\), and if they pass a verdict, they commit excesses\. They have adopted for every truth a wrong way, for every erect thing a bender, for every living being a killer, for every \(closed\) door a key and for every night a lamp\. They covet, but with despair, in order to maintain with it their markets and propagate for their “handsome” merchandise\. When they speak, they create doubts\. When they describe, they exaggerate\. First they offer easy paths but \(afterwards\) they make them narrow\. In short, they are the party of Satan and the stings of the Fire\. “Satan has gained hold on them, so he makes them forget the remembrance of Allah; they

<a id="page670"></a>are Satan’s Party; Beware\! Verily, the party of Satan are the losers” \(Holy Quran, 58: 19\)\.

**Praising Allah, Advising about Fear of Allah and Providing Details about the Day of Judgement**

Praise be to Allah Who has displayed such effects of His authority and the glory of His sublimity through the wonders of His might, so they dazzle the eyes and render the minds incapable of appreciating the reality of His attributes\. I testify that there is no god but Allah by virtue of belief, certainty, sincerity and conviction\. I also testify that Muhammad \(h\) is His slave and Prophet whom He deputed when

the signs of guidance were obliterated and the ways of religion were desolate\. So, he threw open the truth, admonished the people, guided them towards righteousness and ordered them to be moderate\. May Allah bless him and his descendants\.

Be informed, O servants of Allah, that He has not created you for naught and has not left you free\. He knows the extent of His favors over you and the quantity of His bounty towards you\. Therefore, ask Him for success and for the attainment of objectives\. Beg before Him and seek His generosity\. No curtain hides you from Him, nor is any door closed before you against Him\. He is at every place, in every moment and instance\. He is with every man and jinn\. Giving does not create any breach in Him\. Gifting does not cause Him diminution\. A beggar cannot wear Him out \[with his persistent pleas\] and giving \(to others\) can never exhaust Him\.

One person cannot turn His attention from another, one voice does not detract Him from another, and one grant of favor does not prevent Him from refusing another\. Anger does not prevent Him from mercy, mercy does not prevent Him from punishing; His concealment does not hide His manifestation and His manifestation does not prevent Him from concealing\. He is near and at the same time distant\. He is high and at the same time low, He is manifest and also concealed\. He is concealed yet well\-known\. He lends but is not lent anything\. He has not created creation after devising, nor did He receive any assistance on account of fatigue\.

I admonish you, O servants of Allah, to fear Allah, for it is the rein and the mainstay \(of religion\)\. Hold fast to its salient tenets, keep

<a id="page671"></a>hold of its realities\. It would take you to abodes of ease, to places of comfort, to fortresses of safety and to houses of honor on the Day \(of Judgement\) when eyes will be wide open \(see Holy Quran, 14:42\), when there will be darkness all around and when small groups of camels pregnant for ten months will be allowed free grazing\. And when the Horn is blown, every living being will then die, every voice will be muted\. The high mountains and the hard rocks will crumble \(to pieces\) so that their hard stones will turn into moving sand and their bases will become level\. \(On that day\) there will be none to intercede, no kinship to ward off \(trouble\), and no excuse will be of any avail\.

**Sermon 195**

**The Condition of the World at the Time of the Proclamation of Prophethood, the Transience of this World and the State of its Inhabitants \.**

Allah deputed the Prophet \(h\) when no sign of guidance existed, no beacon was giving light and no passage was clear\.

I admonish you, O servants of Allah, to fear Allah, and I warn you of this world which is a house from which departure is inevitable, and it is a place of discomfort\. Whoever lives in it has to depart, and whoever stays here has to leave\. It is drifting with its people like a boat which severe winds dash \(here and there\) in the deep sea\. Some get drowned and die, while others escape on the surface of the waves; winds push them with their currents and carry them towards their dangers\. So, whatever is drowned cannot be restored and whatever escapes is on the way to destruction\.

O servants of Allah\! You should know now that you have to perform \(good\) deeds because \(presently\) your tongues are free, your bodies are healthy, your limbs have movement, the area of your coming and going is vast and the course for your running is wide, before the loss of opportunity or the approach of death\. Take death’s approach as imminent and do not think it will come \(hereafter\)\.

**Sermon 196**

**Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib’s Attachment to the Holy Prophet \(h\), Performance of Funeral Rites for Him \(h\)**

<a id="page672"></a>Those companions of Muhammad \(k\), the custodians \(of the

Divine messages\), know that I never disobeyed Allah or His Messenger1 at all and by virtue of the courage with which Allah honored me, I supported him with my life on occasions when even the brave turned away and feet lagged behind\.

When the Prophet \(h\) died, his head was on my chest and his

\(last\) breath blew over my palms, and I passed it over my face\. I performed his funeral ghusul \(ceremonial bath\), may Allah bless him and his descendants, and the angels helped me\. The house and the courtyard were full of them\. One party of them was descending while another was ascending\. My ears continually caught their humming voice, as they invoked Allah’s blessing on him, till we buried him in his grave\. Thus, who can have greater rights with him than I during his life or after his death? Therefore, depend on your enemy because I swear by the One Who is such that there is no god but He, that I am on the path of truth and that they \(the enemy\) are on the misleading path of wrongdoing\. You hear what I say and I seek Allah’s forgiveness for myself and for you\.

Ibn Abul\-Hadid has written \(in Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 10,

1. 180\-183\) that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s saying that he never disobeyed the commands of the Prophet \(h\) is a sort of taunt to those

who felt no hesitation in rejecting the Prophet’s commands and sometimes even checked him\. For example, when, at the time of the peace of al\-Hudaybiya, the Prophet \(h\) was inclined to negotiate peace with

the unbelievers from among the tribesmen of Quraish, one of the companions became so enraged that he expressed doubts about the Prophethood of the Prophet \(h\) whereupon Abu Bakr had to say: “Woe

be to you\! Keep clinging to him\. He is certainly Allah’s Messenger, and He will not ruin him\.”

The introduction to the oath, “inna” and the word of emphasis “lam”, which are used here \[in the original Arabic text\] to create conviction about the Prophethood shows that the addressee had gone further than mere doubt because these words of emphasis are employed only when the stage of denial has been reached\. However, if belief required absence of doubt, the presence of doubt must imply defect in the belief, as Allah says the following: “The believers are only those who believe in Allah and His Messenger, they do not doubt thereafter” \(Holy Quran, 49: 15\)\.

<a id="page673"></a>Similarly, when the Prophet \(h\) intended to perform the funeral

prayers for Ubayy ibn Salul, the same companion said to him, “How do you intend to seek forgiveness for this chief of hypocrites?” And he even drew away the Prophet \(h\) by pulling the ends of his shirt\.\.\. Then the

Prophet \(h\) had to say, “No deed nothing besides the command of

Allah\.” In the same way, the Prophet’s command to accompany the troops led by Usamah ibn Zayd was ignored\. The greatest of all such insolence was displayed with regard to the Prophet’s intention to write down his advice to the nation\. When such a blame was laid against the Prophet \(h\), a behavior which proves an absence of belief in the commands of

the Shari’a and creates doubt about whether each command was based on the Divine revelation or whether \(Allah forbid\) it was just the result of “mental disorder”\.

Who can deny that the ever\-successful lion of Allah, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), shielded the Prophet \(h\) on every critical occasion

and performed the duty of protecting him by dint of the courage and valor gifted to him by Allah? The first occasion of risking his life was when the unbelievers from the tribe of Quraish decided finally to kill the Prophet \(h\)\. Ali slept on the Prophet’s bed surrounded by enemies and under the

direct peril of swords, whereby the enemies were not able to succeed in their plot\. Then, in those battles where the enemies used to attack the Prophet \(h\) and where the feet of even the reputed heroes could not

stand firm, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) remained steadfast with the

banner \(of Islam\) in his hand\. Abdul\-Barr and al\-Hakim writes the following about it: “Ibn Abbas says that Ali had four qualities which no one else possessed\. First, he was the first among the Arabs and the non\-Arabs to have offered prayers with the Messenger of Allah\. Second, he always had the banner of Islam in his hand in every battle\. Third, when people ran away from the Prophet \(h\), Ali remained with him, and

Fourth, he was the one who gave the Prophet \(h\) his funeral ablution and

placed him in his grave” \(Al_Isti’ab, Vol\. 3, p\. 1090; Al\-Mustadrak Ala Sahihayn, Vol\. 3, p\. 111\)\.

A study of the holy wars of Islam fought during the Prophet’s time leaves no doubt that, except for the battle of Tabuk in which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) did not participate, all other battles testify to his

great performance and all the successes are due to his valour\. Thus, in the battle of Badr, seventy unbelievers were killed, half of whom were killed by Ali’s sword\. In the battle of Uhud, when victory changed into defeat as

<a id="page674"></a>a result of the Muslims engaging themselves in the collection of booty, they fled away under the sudden attack of the enemy, but Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) remained steadfast, taking jihad to be a religious obligation and displayed such conspicuous courage in support and in defense of the Prophet \(h\) that the Prophet \(h\) himself acknowledged it as did arch\-angel Gabriel\. Again, in the battle of the Trench \(al\-Khandaq\), the Prophet \(h\) was accompanied by three thousand combatants, but none dared to face \`Amr ibn Abd\-Wudd\. At last, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)

killed him and saved the Muslims from ignominy\. In the battle of Hunain, the Muslims were proud of their number because they were ten thousand while the unbelievers were only four thousand, but here, too, they leapt onto the booty, as a consequence of which the unbelievers gained the opportunity and pounced upon them\. Taken by surprise thus, the Muslims fled away as the Holy Quran says the following verse: “Most certainly did Allah help you in many \(battle\) fields and on the day of Hunain when made your great number was to your liking, but your being superior in number availed you nothing, and the earth was straitened against you despite its expanse, then you turned back in retreat” \(9: 25\)\.

On this occasion, too, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) remained

steadfast like a rock and eventually, with Allah’s support, victory was achieved\.

**Sermon 197**

**Allah’s Attribute of Omniscience**

Allah knows the cries of the beasts in the forest, the sins of the people in seclusion, themovements of the fishes in the deep seas and the rising of the water by tempestuous winds\. I testify that Muhammad \(h\) is

the choice of Allah, the conveyor of His revelation and the Messenger of His mercy\.

**Why Fearing Allah**

I admonish you to fear Allah Who created you\. To Him is your return, with Him lies the success of your aims, at Him terminate \(all\) your desires, toward Him runs your path of righteousness and He is the aim of your fears \(for seeking protection\)\. Certainly, fear of Allah is themedicine for your hearts, the sight for the blindness of your spirits, the cure for the ailments of your bodies, the rectifier of the evils of your breasts, the

<a id="page675"></a>purifier of the pollution of your minds, the light of the darkness of your eyes, the consolation for the fear of your heart and the brightness for the gloom of your ignorance\.

Therefore, make obedience to Allah the way of your life, not only your outside covering\. Make it your inner habit instead of only outer routine, subtle enough to enter through your ribs \(up to the heart\), the guide for all your affairs, the watering place for your getting down \(on the Day of Judgement\), the one who intercedes for the achievement of your aims, the asylum for the day of your fear, the lamp of the interior of your graves, the company for your long loneliness and the deliverance from the troubles of your abodes\. Certainly, obedience to Allah is a protection against encircling calamities, expected dangers and the flames of burning fires\.

Therefore, whoever entertains fear of Allah, troubles remain away from him after having been near, affairs become sweet after their bitterness, waves \(of troubles\) recede from him after having crowded over him, difficulties become easy for him after occurring, generosity rains fast over him after shortage, mercy bends over him after it had been loath, the favors \(of Allah\) spring forth on him after they had been dried and blessing descends over him in showers after being scanty\. So, fear Allah Who benefits you with His good advice, preaches to you through His Messenger and obliges you with His favors\. Devote yourselves to His worship and acquit yourselves of the obligation of obeying Him\.

**About Islam**

Islam is the religion which Allah has chosen for Himself, developed it before His eyes, preferred it as the best among His creations, established its pillars on His love\. He has disgraced other religions by giving honor to it\. He has humiliated all communities before its sublimity; He has humbled its enemies with His kindness and made its opponents lonely by according it His support\. He has smashed the pillars of misguidance with its columns\. He has quenched the thirst of the thirsty with its cisterns and filled the cisterns through those who draw its water\.

He made Islam such that its constituent parts cannot break, its joins cannot separate, its structure cannot fall, its columns cannot decay, its plant cannot be uprooted, its time does not end, its laws do not expire, its twigs cannot be cut, its parts do not become narrow, its ease does not change into difficulty, its clarity is not affected by gloom, its straightness does not acquire curvature, its wood has no crookedness, its vast paths

<a id="page676"></a>have no narrowness, its lamp knows no putting off and its sweetness has no bitterness\.

It consists of columns whose bases Allah has fixed in truthfulness and whose foundation He has strengthened, and of sources the streams of which are ever full of water, of lamps the flames of which are full of light and of beacons with the help of which travelers get guidance and of signs through which a way is found to its highways and of watering places which provide water to those who come to them\. Allah has placed in Islam the height of His pleasure, the pinnacle of His pillars and the prominence of His obedience\. Before Allah, therefore, its columns stand strong, its structure is lofty, its proofs are bright, its fires are aflame, its authority is strong, its beacons are high and its destruction is difficult\. You should, therefore, honor it, follow it, fulfil its obligations and accord the status due to it\.

**About the Holy Prophet \(h\)**

Allah, the Glorified One, deputed Muhammad \(k\) with the truth

at a time when the destruction of the world was near and the next life was at hand, when its brightness was turning into gloom after shining\. It has become troublesome for its inhabitants, its surface had become rough and its decay had approached near\. This was during the exhaustion of its life at the approach of signs \(of its decay\), the ruin of its inhabitants, the breaking of its links, the dispersal of its affairs, the decay of its signs, the divulging of its secret matters and the shortening of its length\. Allah made him responsible for conveying His message and \(a means of\) honor for his people, a period of bloom for the men of his days, a source of dignity for the supporters and an honor for his helpers\.

**About the Holy Quran**

Then Allah sent him the Book as a light whose flames cannot be extinguished, a lamp whose gleam does not die, a sea whose depth cannot be sounded, a way whose direction does not mislead, a ray whose light does not darken, a separator \(of good from evil\) whose arguments do not weaken, one who clarifies, one whose foundations cannot be dismantled, a cure which leaves no room for disease, an honor whose supporters are not defeated and the truth whose helpers are not abandoned\. Therefore, it is the mine of belief and its nucleus, the source of knowledge and its oceans, the plantation of justice and its pools, the foundation stone of Islam and its construction, the valleys of truth and its plains, an ocean

<a id="page677"></a>which those who draw water cannot empty, springs which those who draw water cannot dry up, a watering place which those who come to take water cannot exhaust, a staging place in moving towards which travelers do not get lost, signs which no trader fails to see and a highland which those who approach it cannot surpass\.

Allah has made it quench the thirst of the learned, a bloom for the hearts of religious jurists, a highway for the ways of the righteous, a cure after which there is no ailment, a glory with which there is no darkness, a rope whose grip is strong, a stronghold whose peak is invulnerable and honor for whoever owes it, a peace for whoever enters it, a guidance for whoever follows it, an excuse for whoever adopts it, an argument for whoever argues with it, a witness for whoever quarrels with it, a success for whoever argues with it, a carrier of burden for whoever seeks the way, a shield for whoever arms himself \(against misguidance\), a knowledge for whoever listens carefully, a worthy story for whoever relates it and a final verdict of whoever passes judgements\.

**Sermon 198**

**Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Advising His Companions about Prayers**

Pledge to uphold prayers and to remain steady on it; offer prayer as much as possible and seek nearness \(to Allah\) through it because it is \(imposed\) upon the believers as a timed ordinance \(Holy Quran, 4:103\)\. Have you not heard the reply of the people of Hell when they are asked: “What has brought you into hell?” They shall say: “We were not of those who offered regular prayers\!” \(Holy Quran, 74: 42\-43\)\. Certainly, prayer drops out sins like the leaves of trees drop and removes them as ropes are removed from the necks of cattle\. The Messenger of Allah \(h\) likened it

to a flowing river at the doorstep of a person who takes a bath in it five times a day\. Will then any dirt remain on him?

Its obligation is recognized by those believers whom neither the adornment of property nor the coolness of the eyes produced by children can turn away from it\. Allah, the Glorified One, says the following: “\.\.\.

men whom neither merchandise nor any diversion distracts them from the remembrance of Allah and constancy in prayer and paying the zakat \(Qur;an, 24: 37\)\.

<a id="page678"></a>Even after receiving assurance of Paradise, the Messenger of Allah \(k\) used to exert himself for the prayers because of the command

of Allah, the Glorified One\. “\.\.\. enjoin prayer on your followers and adhere thereto steadfastly” \(Holy Quran, 20: 132\)\.

Then the Holy Prophet \(h\) used to enjoin his followers to pray and exert himself for its sake\.

**About the Islamic Tax of Zakat**

Then Islamic tax has been laid down along with prayers as a sacrifice \(to be offered\) by the followers of Islam\. Whoever pays it by way of purifying his spirit, it serves as a purifier for him, a protection and a shield against the fire \(of Hell\)\. No one, therefore, \(who pays it\) should feel attached to it afterwards, nor should he feel grieved\. Whoever pays it without the intention of purifying his heart, expecting through it to gain more \[material rewards\], he is certainly ignorant of the Sunnah; he is allowed no reward for it; his action goes to waste, and his hope for repentance is excessive\!

**Fulfillment of Trust**

As regarding the fulfillment of trust, whoever does not pay attention to it will be disappointed\. It was placed before the mighty skies, the vast earth and the high mountains, but none was found to be stronger, more vast, or higher than it\. If anything could be unapproachable because of height, vastness, power or strength, they will have been unapproachable\. But they felt afraid of the evil consequences \(of failing in fulfilling a trust\) and noticed what a weaker person did not realize it, and this was man\. “Verily, he \[man\] was \(proven\) unjust, ignorant” \(Holy Quran, 33: 72\)\.

Surely, Allah, the Glorified One, the Sublime, nothing is hidden from Him of whatever people do in their nights or days\. His knowledge encompasses all things\. Your limbs are a witness \[against you\], the organs of your body constitute an army \(against yourself\), your inner self serves Him as eyes \(to watch over your sins\) and your loneliness is open to Him\.

<a id="page679"></a>

**Sermon 199**

**Treason and Treachery of Mu\`awiyah and the Fate of Those Guilty of Treason**

By Allah, Mu\`awiyah is not more shrewd than I am, but he deceives and commits evil deeds\. Had I not been hateful of deceitfulness, I will have been the most cunning of all men\. But \(the fact is that\) deceit is a sin and sin is disobedience \(of Allah\)\. Every deceitful person will have a banner by which he will be recognized on the Day of Judgement\. By Allah, I cannot be made forgetful by strategy, nor can I be overpowered by hardships\.

People who are ignorant of religion and its ethics, free from the shackles of religious laws and unaware of the concept of punishment and reward find abundance of excuses, methods and means for the achievement of their objectives\. They can find ways to succeed at every stage\. But when they find the dictates of humanity, or Islam, or the limitations imposed by ethics and religious laws as impeding their designs, their chances of devising and finding vile means become narrow and the possibility of their action becomes limited\. Mu\`awiyah’s influence and control was the result of these devices and ways in which he knew no impediment nor any obstacle of what is lawful or unlawful, nor did the fear of the Day of Judgement prevent him from acting defiantly\. Describing the character of Mu\`awiyah, allama ar\-Raghib al\-Isfahani writes the following: “His aim was always to achieve his objective whether lawful or unlawful\. He did not care for religion, nor did he ever think of the Divine chastisement\. Thus, in order to maintain his power, he resorted to false statements and concoctions, practiced all sorts of deceit and contrivance\. When he saw that success was not possible without entangling Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) in war, he roused Talhah

and az\-Zubayr against him\. When success could not be achieved by this means, he instigated the Syrians, bringing about the civil war of Siffin\. And when the status of his rebellion became exposed through the killing of Ammar, he at once duped the people by saying that Ali was responsible for killing him as he had brought him into the battlefield\. And on another occasion, he interpreted the words ‘rebellious party’ in the hadith of the Prophet \(h\) to mean ‘avenging party’, trying desperately to prove that

Ammar would be killed by the group that would seek revenge of Othman’s blood, although the next portion of this statement, that is, ‘he will call them towards Paradise while they will call him to Hell’, does not leave any room for interpretation\. When there was no hope of victory

<a id="page680"></a>even by these cunning means, he contrived to raise the Holy Quran on the spears, although in his view neither the Holy Quran nor its commandments carried any weight\. If he had really aimed at deriving a decision from the Holy Quran, he should have put this demand before the commencement of the battle\. When it became known to him that the decision had been secured by \`Amr ibn al\-As by deceiving Abu Musa al\-Ash\`ari and that it did not have even a remote connection with the Holy Quran, he should not have accepted it and should have punished \`Amr ibn al\-As for this cunning or at least warned and rebuked him\. But on the contrary, the latter’s performance was much appreciated and, in reward, he was made the Governor of Egypt\.

In contrast to this outrage, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s conduct was a high specimen of religious law and ethics\. He kept in view the requirements of truth and righteousness even in adverse circumstances and did not allow his virtuous life to be tarnished by the views of deceit and contrivance\. If he wished, he could face cunning by cunning and Mu\`awiyah’s shameful activities could have been answered by similar measures\. For example, when he posted guards on the Euphrates and stopped the supply of its water \(to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s men\), then the supply of water could have been cut off from them also on the grounds that since they had occupied the Euphrates, it was lawful to retaliate\. In this way, they could be overpowered by weakening their fighting power\. But Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) could never tarnish his

hands with such an inhuman deed which was not permitted by any law or code of ethics, although common people regard such deeds against the enemy as lawful and call this duplicity of character for the achievement of success as a normal policy and administrative ability\. But Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) could never think of strengthening his power by fraud or

duplicity of behavior on any occasion\. Thus, when people advised him to retain the officers who had been appointed during the government of Othman and to befriend Talhah and az\-Zubayr by assigning them governorship of KÅfa and Basra and make use of Mu\`awiyah’s ability in administration by giving him the government of Syria\.\.\., Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) rejected this advice and preferred the commandments of the

religious law over worldly expediency and openly declared about Mu\`awiyah as follow: “If I allow Mu\`awiyah to retain what he already has, I will be one who takes those who lead \(people\) astray as helpers” \(refer to Holy Quran, 18: 51\)\.\.

Those who look at apparent successes do not care to find out by what means the success has been achieved\. They support anyone whom

<a id="page681"></a>they see as succeeding by means of cunning and deception, and they begin to regard him an administrator, a man of intelligence, a politician, an intellectually brilliant man \.\.\., and so on, while whoever does not deploy cunning and fraudulent methods due to his adherence to Islamic commandments and the Divine instructions and prefers failure over success secured through wrong methods is regarded as ignorant of politics and weak in foresight\. They do not feel it necessary to think what difficulties and impediments exist in the way of a person who adheres to principles and laws which prevent him from proceeding forward even after approaching near success\.

**One Should Not Be Afraid of the Scarcity of Those Who Tread on the Right Path**

O people\! Do not wonder at the small number of those who follow the right path because people throng only around the table \(of this world\) whose edibles are few but whose hunger is insatiable\.

O people\! Certainly what gathers people together is \(their\) agreement \(to good or bad\) and \(their\) disagreement, for only one individual killed the camel of Thamud190 but Allah held all of them as

190Thamud, an ancient Arabian tribe or group of tribes, seems to have been prominent from about the 4th Century B\.C\. to the first half of the 7th Century A\.D\. Their homeland, called the Valley of al\-Qura \[Wadi al\-Qura, valley of the towns\], was lying on the way between Hijaz and Syria and bore this name because it consisted of several towns\. Allah deputed for their guidance and directions Prophet Salih who preached to them as Allah relates in his story: “And to \(the people of\) Thamud \(We did send\) their brother Salih\. He said, ‘O my people\! Worship Allah \(alone\); you have no god other than Him\. Indeed there came to you a clear proof from your Master: this is the she\-camel of Allah \(which\) to you is a Sign; so, leave it to pasture in Allah’s earth and do not touch her with any harm or else you should be seized with a painful chastisement\. And remember when He made you successors after the \(people\) of Ad and settled you in the land\. You build mansions on its plain and hew the mountains into dwellings\. So, remember the bounties of Allah and do not seek to do mischief on earth\.’ Said the chiefs of those who were puffed up with pride from among his people to those who were regarded as weak to those who believed from among them \(sarcastically\): ‘Do you know that Salih is sent by his Lord?\!’ Said they: ‘Verily, we believe in what he has been sent\.’ Said those who were puffed up with pride: ‘Verily we, in that which you believe, are disbelievers\.’ They hamstrung the she\-camel and rebelled against the command of their Lord and

<a id="page682"></a>liable for punishment because all of them joined him with their acquiescence\. Thus, Allah, the Glorified One, has said the following: “Then they hamstrung her and became regretful” \(Holy Quran, 26: 157\)\.

Then their land declined by sinking \(into earth\) as the spike of a plough pierces unploughed weak land\. O people\! Whoever treads the clear path \(of guidance\) reaches the spring of water, and whoever abandons it strays into a barren desert\.

**Sermon 201**

**What Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Said on the Occasion of the Burial of the Supreme Lady, Fatima \(x\), While Addressing the Holy Prophet \(h\) at His Grave :**

O Prophet of Allah \(k\)\! Peace be upon you from me and from your daughter who has come to you and who has hastened to meet you\. O Prophet of Allah \(k\), my patience about your chosen \(daughter\) has been

exhausted and my power of endurance has weakened, except that I have ground for consolation in having endured the great hardship and heart\-rending event of your separation\. I laid you down in your grave when you breathed your last \(as your head was\) between my neck and chest\.

said: ‘O Salih\! Bring us that with which you did threaten us, if you are \[as you claim\] one of the Messengers\.’ Then the earthquake seized them \(while they were unaware\), so they became in their dwellings motionless\. Then he turned away from them and said: ‘O my people\! Indeed I did deliver to you the message of my Lord and did admonish you, but you do not love those who admonish you’” \(Holy Quran, 7: 73\-79\)\. \(The people of\) Thamud belied the warners and said: “What?\! A single man from among us \[thus dares to warn us\]\! And we are to follow him?\! Verily, then, we shall be straying and in distress\. It is that reminding has been bestowed on him \(alone\) of all people from among us?\! Nay\! He is a great liar and an insolent one\!’ Soon they shall know on the morrow \(as to\) who the liar is, the insolent one\. \(O Our Messenger Salih\!\) verily We are going to send the she\-camel as a trial for them; so, watch them and be patient\. And \(you O Salih\!\) make them aware \(beforehand\) that the water is \(to be\) divided between them, and every drinking share shall be witnessed\. But they called their companions, then he pursued and hamstrung her\. How \(great\) was My chastisement and My warning? Verily We sent upon them a single \(violent\) blast and they were \(all\) like the dry stubble used by a fencer in a fence” \(Holy Quran, 54: 23\-31\)\.

<a id="page683"></a>“Verily we are Allah’s and verily to Him shall we return” \(Holy Quran, 2: 156\)\.

Now, the trust has been returned, and what had been given has been taken back\. As to my grief, it knows no bounds, and as to my nights, they will remain sleepless till Allah chooses for me the house in which you are now residing\.

Certainly, your daughter will apprise you of the joining together of your191 umma \(people\) for the aim of oppressing her\. Ask her for the details and get all the news\. This has happened only a short period of time had elapsed, yet your remembrance has already disappeared\.\.\. My Salam be to you both, the Salam of a grief \-stricken one, ndighdf a disgusted nor a hateful one\. If I go away, it is not because I am weary \(of you\), and if I

191The treatment meted out to the daughter of the Prophet \(h\) after his death was extremely painful and sad\. Although Sayyidatul\-Nisa’\[head of all women of mankind\], Fatima \(x\), did not live in this world more than a few months after the death of her most revered father, the Prophet \(h\), yet even this

short period has a long tale of grief to tell and many woes\. In this regard, the first scene that strikes the eyes is the fact that the arrangements for the funeral rites of the Prophet \(h\) had not yet been made when the contest for power and authority started at the _saqifa_ \[shed\] of Banu Sa’idah\. Naturally, their leaving the body of the Prophet \(h\) \(without burial\) must have deeply injured the grief\-

stricken heart of Sayyidatul Nisa’, Fatima \(x\)\. She saw how those who had professed love and attachment to the Prophet \(h\)\) during his life\-life became so

engrossed in their machinations for pursuing power and authority, so much so that instead of consoling his only daughter, they did not even care to know when the Prophet \(h\) was to be given his funeral rites and when he was to be buried\.

And the way they “consoled” her was by crowding at her house after having brought firewood in order to set fire to her house and to burn everyone inside it\. All of this they did in order to secure the oath of allegiance by such brute force from her husband, Imam Ali \(x\), and from Ahl al\-Bayt \(x\)\. They justified all of

this coercion, compulsion and violence to achieve their goal of usurping the power of the government for themselves\. In fact, all these excesses were to obliterate the prestigious status of this house\. They thus hoped it might not regain its lost prestige on any occasion in the future\. With this aim in view, and in order to crush her economic status and that of her family, by confiscating her \(estate of\) Fadak through trickery and falsehood\.\.\., the ultimate effect was that Sayyidatul\-Nisa’ Fatima \(x\) was killed with grief in her heart, and even then,

none was there to witness her burial\. Till now, nobody even knows where she was buried\.\.\. Love for this world thus blinds people\.

**Transience of this World, the Importance of Collecting Provisions for the Next Life**

O people\! Certainly this world is a passage while the next is a place of permanent abode\. So, take from the passage \(all that you can\) for the permanent abode\. Do not tear away your curtain before the One Who is aware of your secrets\. Take your hearts away from this world before your bodies exit out of it\. Herein, you have been put on trial, and you have been created for the other world\. When a man dies, people ask what \(property\) he has left, while the angels ask what \(good actions\) he has sent forward \[to his Hereafter\]\. May Allah bless you; send forward something; it will be a loan for you\. Do not leave everything behind, for that will be a burden on you\.192

**What Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Provided the Following**

**General Advice to His Companions, Warning Them about the Perils of the Day of Judgement **:

May Allah have mercy on you\! Prepare provisions for the \[imminent\] journey \[to the life to come\] because the call for departure has been announced\. Regard your stay in this world as very short, and return \(to Allah\) with the best provisions with you because surely, in front of you lies a valley difficult to climb and places of stay full of fears and dangers\. You have to get there and to permanently stay\. And be admonished that the eyes of death are approaching you, fixed on you\. It is as though you are \(already\) in the talons of death, and it has struck you\. Difficult affairs and distressing dangers have crushed you into it\. You should, therefore, cut away all the attachments of this world and seek assistance with the provision of the fear of Allah\.

192When Hazrat Khadija, first wife of the Prophet \(k\), passed away,

she left neither a gold dinar nor a silver dirham\. Thus are we told by historians\. How many people are thus admonished, and how many act upon this admonishment? \_\_ Ed\.

<a id="page685"></a>Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “part of this statement has been quoted before through another narration\.”

**Sermon 204**

**Having Sworn Allegiance to Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\),**

**Talhah and Az\-zubayr Complained to Him That He Had Not Consulted Them or Sought Their “Advice” in the Affairs \(of State\)\. Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Replied as Follows :**

You both frown over a small issue and leave aside many big ones\. Can you tell me of anything wherein you have a right of which I have deprived you, or a share which was due to you and which I have held away from you, or any Muslim who has laid any claim before me and I have been unable to decide it or have been ignorant of it, or committed a mistake about it?

By Allah, I had no liking for the caliphate, nor have I had any interest in the government, but you yourselves invited me to it and prepared me for it\. When the caliphate came to me, I kept the Book of Allah in my view and all that Allah had put the rein for us, all that according to what He has commanded us to decide\. I followed it and also acted on whatever the Prophet \(h\) had laid down as his Sunnah\. In this

matter, I did not need your advice nor the advice of anyone else, nor has there been any order of which I was ignorant so that I ought to have consulted you or my Muslim brethren\. If it were so, I would not have turned away from you or from others\. As regarding your reference to the question of equality \(in the distribution of shares from the Muslim common fund\), this is a matter in which I have not taken a decision according to my own opinion, nor have I done it by my caprice\. But I found and you, too, \(must have\) found, that whatever the Prophet \(h\)

brought had been finalized\. Therefore, I felt no need to turn towards you about a share which had been determined by Allah and in which His verdict has been passed\. By Allah, in this matter, therefore, you two or anyone else can have no favor from me\. May Allah keep our hearts and yours in righteousness, and may He grant us and yourselves endurance\.

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) added: “May Allah have mercy on

the person who, when he sees the truth, supports it, when he sees falsehood, he rejects it and who helps the truth against anyone who is wrong\.”

**During the Battle of Siffin, Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Heard**

**Some of His Men Verbally Abusing the Syrians, So He Said the**

**Following :**

I dislike for you to start taunting them, but if you describe their deeds and recount their situations, it will be a better mode of speech and a more convincing argument\. Instead of abusing them you should say, “O Allah\! Save our blood and theirs, produce reconciliation between us and them and lead them out of their misguidance so that whoever is ignorant of the truth may know it and whoever inclines towards rebellion and rebellion may turn away from it\.”

**Sermon 206**

**In the Battle of Siffin, Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Saw Imam Al\-hasan Proceeding Rapidly to Fight, So He Said the Following :**

Hold back this young man on my behalf lest he should cause my ruin because I am loath to send these two \(meaning al\-Hassan and al\-Hussain\) towards death, lest the descending line of the Prophet \(h\) is cut off permanently by their death\.

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s words ‘amiku anni hadha’l\- ghulam’ \(i\.e\. Hold back this young man on my behalf\) represents the highest and the most eloquent form of expression\.”

**Sermon 207**

**When Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib’s Companions Expressed Displeasure about His Attitude Concerning the Arbitration1, He Said the Following :**

193When the surviving forces of the Syrians lost ground and were ready to run away from the field, Mu\`awiyah changed the tables of the battle by using the Holy Quran as his instrument of political strategy, succeeding in creating such a division among the Iraqis that, despite Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s efforts at counseling, they were not prepared to take any forward step\. They insisted on stopping the war, whereupon Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), too, had to reluctantly

<a id="page687"></a>O people\! Matters between me and you went as I wished till war exhausted you\. By Allah, it has overtaken some of you while leaving others, completely weakening your enemy\. Till yesterday, I was giving orders but today I am being given orders\! Till yesterday, I was dissuading people \(from wrong deeds\), but today I am being dissuaded\! You have now shown a liking to live in this world, and it is not for me to bring you to what you dislike\.

**Sermon 208**

**Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Went to Inquire about the Health**

**of His Companion Al\-Ala’ Ibn Ziyad al\-Harithi\. When He Noticed the Vastness of His Mansion Estate, He Said the Following :**

What will you do with this vast house in this world, although you need this house more in the next world? If you want to take it to the next world, you can entertain in it guests and be regardful of kinship and discharge all \(your\) obligations according to their accrual\. In this way, you will be able to take it to the next world\.

Then al\-Ala said to him: “O Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\! I want to complain to you about my brother Asim ibn Ziyad\.” Imam Ali ibn Abu

agree to arbitration\. Among these people there were some who had actually been duped, believing that they were being asked to abide by the Holy Quran, but there were others who had become weary of the long duration of the war and had lost stomach for it, thus cowering\. Then people got a good opportunity to stop the war; so, they cried hoarse for its postponements\. There were others who had accompanied Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) because of his temporal authority

but did not support him by heart, nor did they aim at achieving victory for him\. There were some people who had expectations with Mu\`awiyah and had started attaching hopes to him for worldly gains, while there were some who were, from the very beginning, \[covertly\] in league with him\. In these circumstances, and with such an army, it was really due to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s political ability and competence of military control and administration that he carried out the war up to this stage\. Had Mu\`awiyah not adopted this trick, there could have been no doubt in Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s victory because the military power of the Syrian forces had been exhausted and defeat was hovering over their heads\. In this regard, Ibn Abul\-Hadd writes the following: “Malik al\-Ashtar had reached Mu\`awiyah and \[angrily\] grabbed him by the neck\. The entire might of the Syrians had been smashed\. Only so much movement was discernable in them as remains in the tail of a lizard which is killed, but the tail continues hopping right and left” \(_Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha_, Vol\. 11, pp\.30\-1\)\.

<a id="page688"></a>Talib \(x\) inquired: “What is the matter with him?” Al\-Ala’ said the

following: “He has put on a woolen coat and cut off himself from the world\.” Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said, “Let me see him\.” When the man came, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said to him, “O enemy of

yourself\! Certainly, the evil one \(Satan\) has misguided you\. Do you feel no compassion for your wife and children? Do you believe that if you use those things which Allah has made lawful for you, He will dislike you? You are too unimportant for Allah to do so\.” The man said, “O Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\! You yourself put on coarse outfits and eat rough food\.”

The Imam replied thus: “Woe unto you\! I am not like you\. Certainly, Allah, the Sublime, has made it obligatory on true leaders that they should maintain themselves at the level of low people so that the poor do not cry over their poverty\.”

Since ancient times, asceticism and the abandonment of worldly attachments has been regarded as a means of purification of the spirit and importance of the soul\. Consequently, those who wished to lead a life of abstention and meditation used to go out of the cities and towns to stay in forests and caves in the mountains and stay there concentrating on Allah according to their own way of thinking\. They would eat only if a casual traveler or the inhabitant of nearby dwellings gave them anything to eat; otherwise, they remained contented with the fruits of wild trees and the water of the streams\. Thus did they pass their life away from the public\. Actually, this way of “worship” commenced in a way that was forced by the oppression and cruelty of rulers\. Certain people left their houses and, in order to avoid the grip of such rulers, hid in some wilderness or a cave in a mountain, engaging themselves in worship of and devotion to Allah\. Later on, this forced asceticism acquired a voluntary form and people began to retire to caves and hollows of their own volition\. Thus, it became an accepted way that whoever aimed at spiritual development retired to some corner after severing himself from all worldly ties\. This method remained in vogue for centuries\. Even nowadays, some traces of this way of “worship” are found among Buddhists and Christians\.

The moderate views of Islam do not, however, agree with the monastic life style\. In order to attain spiritual development, one does not have to abandon lawful worldly enjoyments and pleasures, nor should a Muslim leave his house and fellow men and keep himself occupied in such sort of “worship\.” One must not thus hide in some corner\. The concept of worship in Islam is not confined to a few particular rituals\. Islam regards the earning of one’s livelihood through lawful means, sympathy with and concern about others, good behavior, and cooperation

<a id="page689"></a>with and assistance of others are absolutely important, so important that they are the stuff of true worship\. If an individual ignores his responsibilities and does not fulfil his obligations towards his wife and children, nor does he occupy himself with earning a livelihood but instead spends all his time meditating, he ruins his life and does not fulfil the purpose of living in this world\. If this were Allah’s aim behind creating His servants, what would have been the need for creating and populating the world especially when there was already a category of beings who all the time are engaged in worshipping and adoring the Lord of Lords, seeking forgiveness for His servants?

The Creator has made man stand at the cross\-roads of options where the mid\-way represents the center of guidance\. If he deviates from this point of moderation even a bit, tilting towards this way or that, there is nothing but sheer misguidance for him\. That mid\-way is that he should neither bend towards this world to such an extent that he ignores the next life, devoting himself entirely to this one, nor should he abstain from this world to the extent that he has no regard for nor interest in anything in it, confining himself to some corner, isolating himself from everyone\. Since Allah has created man and placed him in this world, man should follow the code of life for living in this world\. He should partake of the comforts and pleasures bestowed by Allah within moderate limits\. Eating and enjoying things made lawful by Allah does not go against Allah’s worship\. Rather, Allah has created these things for the very purpose that they should be enjoyed, and so that He would be thanked for providing them for mankind\. That is why those who were chosen and preferred by Allah from among all His servants lived in this world with others eating, drinking, marrying and fathering children just like all others\. They did not feel the need to turn their faces away from the people of this world and adopt a norm of life in the wilderness, in caves of mountains as their abodes, or in places distant from the public\. On the other hand, they remembered Allah, remained disentangled from worldly affairs and did not forget death despite the pleasures and comforts of this life\.

The life of asceticism sometimes produces such evils that ruin the next life for the “ascetic” person also as well as ruining this one\. Such an individual proves to be the true portrait of one who loses this life as well as the next\. When natural urges are not satisfied in the lawful and legal way, the mind turns into a center of evil\-insinuated ideas, becoming incapable of performing worship with peace and concentration\. And sometimes passions overcome the ascetic to the extent that he would break all moral fetters, devoting himself completely to their satisfaction\. Consequently, man falls into an abyss of ruin from which it is impossible

<a id="page690"></a>to extract himself\. That is why religious laws accord a greater status to the worship performed by a family man than that by a non\-family man because the former can exercise mental peace and concentration in the worship and rituals\.

Individuals who put on the cloak of Sufism and make a loud show of their spiritual greatness are cut off from the path of Islam and are ignorant of its wide teachings\. They have been misled by Satan and, relying on their self\-formed concepts, tread wrongful paths\. Eventually, their misguidance becomes so serious that they begin to regard their leaders as having attained such a level that their word is like the word of Allah, and their deed is as though that of Allah\.\.\. Sometimes, they regard themselves as being beyond all the bounds and limitations of religious laws, considering every evil deed as lawful for them\. This deviation from the faith and creed is labeled as Sufism\. Its unlawful principles are called tariqah \(way of achieving communion with Allah\) and the followers of this cult are known as Sufis\. First, Abu Hashim al\-Kufi al\-Shami adopted this title\. He was of an Umayyad descent and a fatalist \(believing that man is bound to act as pre\-ordained by Allah\)\. The reason for giving him this name was that in order to make a show of his asceticism and fear of Allah, he put on a woolen cloak\. Later on, this title became common and various grounds were put forth as the bases of this name\. For example, one ground is that sufi has three letters: the sad, waw and fa’\. Sad stands for sabr, endurance, sidq, truthfulness, and safa, purity of heart\. The waw, according to them, stands for wudd, love or affection, wird \(repetition of Allah’s Name\) and wafa’, faithfulness to Allah\. The fa’ stands for fard, unity or oneness, faqr, poverty or destitution, and fana’, death or absorption in the Self of Allah\. The second view is that it has been derived from “as\- Suffah”, a platform near the Prophet’s mosque which had a covering of date\-palm leaves and which housed a number of poor and homeless companions of the Prophet \(k\)\. Those who stayed there

were called ashabus \-Suffah \(people of the platform\)\. The third view is that the name of the progenitor of an Arab tribe was Sufah and his tribe performed the duties of serving the pilgrims and the Ka\`ba, and it is with reference to their regard that this tribe and those people were called Sufis\. This group is divided among various sects but the basic sects are seven only as follows:

1. al\-Wahdatiyyah \(unitarian\): This sect believes in the oneness of all existence\. Its belief is that everything IN this world is Allah, so much so that they assign to even polluted things the same divine status\. They liken Allah with the river and the waves rising in it, arguing that the waves which sometimes rise and sometimes fall have no separate

<a id="page691"></a>existence other than the river, but their existence is exactly the existence of the river\. Therefore, nothing can be separated from its own existence\.

1. al\-Ittihayyah \(the unitists\): They believe that they have united with Allah and Allah has united with them\. They liken Allah with fire and themselves with iron that lies in the fire from which it acquires its form and quality\.
2. al\-Huluyyah \(the formists\): Their belief is that Allah takes the form of those who claim to know Him and the perfect ones and their bodies are places of His stay\. In this way, they are seemingly men but really Allah\.
3. al\-Wasiliyyah \(the combiners\): This sect considers itself to have combined with Allah\. Their belief is that the laws of the Shar’a are a means of development of the human personality and character and that when the human self combines with Allah, it no longer needs perfection or development\. Consequently, for the Wasilis, worship and ritual become useless because they hold that when truth/reality is achieved, the Shari\`a becomes irrelevant\. Therefore, they can do anything, and they cannot be questioned\.
4. az\-Zarraqiyyah \(the revelers\): This sect regards vocal and instrumental music as worship; it earns the pleasures of this world through a show of asceticism and from door to door begging\. They are ever engaged in relating concocted stories of miraculous performances of their leaders in order to impress the common people\.
5. al\-Ushshaqiyyah \(the lovers\): The theory of this sect is: Apparency is the means to reality, meaning that carnal love is the means to achieve the love of Allah\. That is, in order to reach the stage of Allah’s love, it is necessary to have love with a human beauty\. But the love which they regard as love for Allah is just the product of mental disorder through which the lover inclines to one individual with all his attention\. His final objective is to have access to the beloved one\. This love can lead to the way of evil and vice, but it has no connection with the love of Allah\.

A Persian couplet says: “The truth of the fact is that carnal desire is like a jinn, and a jinn cannot give you guidance\.”

1. at\-Talqiniyyah \(the encounterers\): According to this “sect”, the reading of religious sciences and books of scholarship is totally unlawful\.

<a id="page692"></a>Instead, the status that is achieved by an hour of spiritual effort of the Sufis cannot be achieved even by seventy years of book reading\.

According to Shi\`a ulema’, all these sects are on the wrong path and out of the fold of Islam\. In this regard, numerous sayings of the Imams are related\. In this sermon, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has

regarded the severance of Asim ibn Ziyad from this world as the mischief of Satan\. He strongly dissuaded him from adopting that course\. \(For further study, see Sharh Nahjul \-Balagha, al\-Hajj Mirza Habibullah a\-Khoei, Vol\. 13, pp\.132\-417; Vol\. 14, pp\. 2\-22\)\.

**Sermon 209**

**Someone1 Asked Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) about Concocted Traditions and Contradictory Sayings of the Prophet \(h\)**

**Which Were Then in Circulation among the Public\. The Imam Said the Following :**

Certainly, what is current among the people is both right and wrong, true and false, repealing and repealed, general and particular, definite and indefinite, exact and surmised\. Even during the Prophet’s days, false sayings had been attributed to him, so much so that he had to say during his sermon that “Whoever attributes falsehoods to me makes his own abode in Hell\.” Those who relate traditions are no more than four categories:

194This person was Sulaym ibn Qays al\-Hilali, one of the narrators of traditions through Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\)\.

<a id="page693"></a>**1\. The Lying Hypocrites**

The hypocrite is a person who makes a show of faith and adopts the appearance of a Muslim\. He does not hesitate to sin, nor does he keep aloof from vice\. He willfully attributes false things to the Messenger of Allah\. If people knew that he was a hypocrite and a liar, they would not accept anything from him and would not consider what he says\. Rather, they would say that he is the companion of the Prophet \(h\), has met him,

heard \(his statements\) and acquired knowledge from him\. They, therefore, accept what he says\. Allah, too, had warned you against the hypocrites and described them fully to you\. They have continued after the Holy Prophet \(h\)\. They gained positions with the leaders of misguidance and

callers towards Hell through falsehoods and slandering\. So, the latter put them in high positions and made them officers over the heads of the people, letting them amass wealth\. People are always with the rulers and after this world except those to whom Allah affords protection\. This is the first of the four categories\.

**2\. Those Who are Mistaken**

Then there is the individual who heard \(a saying\) from the Holy Prophet \(h\) but did not memorize it as it was, but surmised its gist\. He

does not lie willfully\. Now, he carries the saying with him and relates it, depends upon it and claims that: “I heard it from the Messenger of Allah\.” If the Muslims come to know that he has committed a mistake in it, they will not accept it from him, and if he himself knows that he is wrong, he will give it up\.

**3\. Those Who are Ignorant**

The third man is one who heard the Prophet \(h\) ordering to do something, and later the Prophet \(h\) forbade people from doing it, but this man did not know it, or he heard the Prophet \(h\) forbidding people

from doing something and later he allowed it, but this man did not know it\. In this case, he retained in his mind what had been repealed and did not retain the repealing tradition\. If he knew that it had been repealed, he would reject it, or if the Muslims knew, when they heard it from him, that it had been repealed, they would reject it\.

<a id="page694"></a>**4\. Those Who Accurately Memorize**

The last, namely the fourth man, is whoever does not speak a lie against Allah or against His Prophet \(h\)\. He hates falsehood out of fear

for Allah and respect for the Messenger of Allah and does not commit mistakes, but retains \(in his mind\) exactly what he heard \(from the Prophet \(h\)\) and he relates it as he heard it without adding anything or

omitting anything\. He heard the repealing tradition, he retained it and acted upon it and he heard the repealed tradition and rejected it\. He also understands the particular and the general and he knows the definite and indefinite and gives everything its due status\.

The sayings of the Prophet \(h\) used to be of two types\. One was

particular and the other common\. Sometimes a man would hear him but he would not know what Allah, the Glorified One, meant by it or what the Messenger of Allah meant by it\. In this way the listener carries it and memorizes it without knowing its meaning and its real intention, or what was its reason\. Among the companions of the Messenger of Allah all were not in the habit of putting him questions and ask him the meanings, indeed they always wished that some Bedouin or stranger might come and ask him \(x\) so that they would also listen\. Whenever any such thing came

before me, I asked him about its meaning and preserved it\. These are the reasons and grounds of differences among the people in their traditions\.

In this sermon, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has divided the traditionists into four categories:\.

The first category is that of a man who concocts a tradition then attributes it to the Prophet \(h\)\. Traditions were in fact falsified and

attributed to him even during his holy life\-time\. This process continued with the result that numerous fabricated traditions came into existence\. This is a fact which cannot be denied, but if anyone does deny it, his basis would not be knowledge, or sagacity by oratory, or argumentative necessity\. Thus, once, “alamul\-huda” \(the ensign of guidance\), namely Sayyid al\-Murtada, had a chance to meet some Sunni ulema’ \(scholars\) with whom he made a debate\. During that incident, Sayyid al\-Murtada proved by citing historical facts that the traditions related about the merits of the “great companions” \(or the “righteous caliphs”\) were concocted and fabricated\. On this, the \(Sunni\) ulema’ argued that it was impossible that someone should dare to speak a lie against the Prophet \(h\) and make

<a id="page695"></a>up a tradition by himself then attribute it to the Prophet \(k\)\. Sayyid al\-

Murthada said that there was a tradition of the Prophet \(h\) that:

“Many false things will be attributed to me after my death; whoever speaks a lie against me will be preparing his own abode in Hell” \(al\-Bukhari, Vol\. 1, p\. 38; Vol\. 2, p\. 102; Vol\. 4, p\. 207; Vol\. 8, p\. 54; Muslim, Vol\. 8, p\. 229; Abu Dawud, Vol\. 3, pp\. 319\-320; al \-Tirmidhi, Vol\. 4, p\. 524; Vol\. 5, pp\. 35\-36, 40, 199, 634; Ibn Majah, Vol\. 1, pp\. 13\-15\)\.

If you regard this tradition as true, then you should agree that false things have, indeed, been attributed to the Prophet \(h\)\. But if you

regard it as false, this would still prove our point\. However, these were people whose hearts were full of hypocrisy and who used to make up traditions of their own in order to create mischief and dispersion in religion and to misguide the Muslims of weak convictions\. Such fabricators kept thus fabricating “traditions” just as they used to do during the lifetime of the Prophet \(h\) just as they remained busy in their

activities of mischief and destruction in those days\. They were not unmindful of altering the teachings of Islam and metamorphosing its saline features\. Rather, in the days of the Prophet \(h\), they were always afraid lest he should expose them and put them to shame\. But after the demise of the Prophet \(h\), their hypocritical activities increased, and

they attributed false things to the Prophet \(h\) without demur for their own personal ends\. Those who heard them believed in them because of their status as companions of the Prophet \(h\), thinking that whatever

they said was correct and whatever they gave out was true\. Afterwards, the belief that all the companions are correct put a stopper on their tongues, as a result of which they were taken to be above criticism, questioning, discussion and censure\. Besides, their conspicuous performance had made them prominent in the eyes of the government\. Also because of this, the government lacked the courage to speak against them\. This is proven by Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s words: “These people gained positions with the leaders of misguidance and callers towards Hell, through falsehood and slandering\. So, they put them in high positions and made them officers over the heads of the people\.”

Along with the destruction of Islam, the hypocrites also aimed at amassing wealth\. They were doing so claiming to be Muslims because of which they did not want to remove the veil of Islam \(from their faces\) and to come out openly\. They wanted to continue their Satanic activities under

<a id="page696"></a>the garb of Islam, engaging themselves in its basic destruction, spreading division and dissension by concocting false “traditions”\. In this regard, Ibn Abul \-Hadid has written the following: “When they were left free, they, too, left many things\. When people remained silent about them, they also remained silent about Islam\. But they continued their underground activities such as the fabrication of falsehoods to which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has alluded\. Many untrue matters had been mixed with the

traditions by the same group of people of wrong beliefs who aimed at misguidance and the distortion of views and beliefs, while some of them also aimed at extolling some particular party with whom they had other worldly aims as well\.”

On the expiration of this period, when Mu\`awiyah took over the leadership of the religion and occupied the throne of temporal authority, he opened an official department for the fabrication of “traditions”, ordering his officers to fabricate and popularize traditions in disparagement of Ahl al\-Bayt \(x\) \(the Household of the Holy Prophet

\[h\]\), extol Othman and the Umayyads, and announcing generous

rewards and land grants for this work\. Consequently, a lot of traditions about self\-made distinctions gained entry in the books of traditions\. Thus, Abul\-Hassan al\- Mada’ini has written in his book Kitab al\- ahadith which Ibn Abul \-Hadid has quoted as follows: “Mu\`awiyah wrote to his officers that they should take special care of those who were followers of Othman, his well\-wishers and lovers and to award high status, precedence and honor to those who related traditions about his merits and distinctions,and to convey to him whatever is thus related by any person, along with his name, the name of his father and the name of his tribe\. They did accordingly and heaped up traditions about the merits and distinctions of Othman because Mu\`awiyah used to award them rewards, clothes, grants and lands\.”

When the fabricated traditions about the merits of Othman had been disseminated throughout the Islamic lands, with the idea that the status of the earlier Caliphs should not remain low, Mu\`awiyah wrote the following to his officers: “As soon as you receive this order of mine, you should call upon the people to make up traditions about the distinctions of the companions and other caliphs, too\. Make sure that if any Muslim relates any tradition in praise of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), you should

make up a similar tradition about the companions to contradict it because this gives me great pleasure and cools my eyes and it weakens the status of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib and his party and is more severe to them than the merits and distinctions of Othman\. When his letters were read to the

<a id="page697"></a>people, a large number of such traditions were related extolling the companions that are all fabricated with no truth at all” \(Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 11, pp\. 43\-47\)\.

In this regard, “Abu Abdillah”, namely Ibrahm ibn Muhammad ibn Arafah, famous as Niftawayh \(244/858 \- 323/935\), was one of the prominent scholars and traditionists who have written about this subject\. Ibn Abul \-Hadid has quoted him saying, “Most false traditions about the merits of the companions were fabricated during the days of Mu\`awiyah in order to gain status in his audience because his view was that in this way he could disgrace Banu Hashim and render their status low” \(Ibid\.\)\.

After that, fabrication of traditions became a good paying job for many\. The seekers of this world made it a means of securing status with their contemporary kings and nobles and to amass wealth\. For example, Ghiyath ibn Ibrahim an\-Nakh\`i \(2nd cent\. A\.H\.\) fabricated a tradition about the flight of pigeons in order to please al\-Mahdi ibn al\-Mansur \(the Abbasid caliph\) and to secure a status near to him \(Tarikh Baghdad, Vol\. 12, pp\. 323\-327; Mizan al \-I’tidal, Vol\. 3, pp\.337\-338; Lisan al\-Mizan, Vol\. 4, p\.422\)\. Abu Sa’id al\-Mada’ini and others made it a means of livelihood\. The maximum limit was reached when al\-Karramiyya and some of the al\-Mutasawwifah gave the ruling that the fabrication of traditions for the prevention of sin or for persuasion towards obedience was lawful\. Consequently, with regard to persuading and dissuading, traditions were fabricated quite freely, and this was not regarded as being against the religious law or in contradiction with morality\. Rather, this work was generally done by those who bore the appearance of asceticism or fear of Allah and who passed their nights in praying and days in filling their books with false traditions\. An idea about the number of these fabricated traditions can be formulated from the fact that out of six hundred thousand traditions, al\-Bukhari selected only two thousand and seven hundred and sixty\-one traditions \(Tarikh Baghdad, Vol\. 2, p\.8; Al\-Irshad as\-Sari, Vol\. 1, p\.28; Sifatul\- Safwah, Vol\. 4, p\. 143\)\. Muslim regarded for selection in his book only four thousand out of three hundred thousand traditions \(Tarikh Baghdad, Vol\. 13, p\. 101; Al\-Muntzam, Vol\. 5, p\.32; Tabaqat al\-Huffaz, Vol\. 2, pp\. 151, 157; Wafiyyat al\-A’yan, Vol\. 5, p\. 194\)\. Abu Dawud took four thousand and eight hundred out of five hundred thousand \(Tarikh Baghdad, Vol\. 9, p\. 57; Tabaqat al\-Huffaz, Vol\. 2, p\. 154; Al\-Muntazam, Vol\. 5, p\. 97; Wafiyyat al \-A’yan, Vol\. 2, p\. 404\) and Ahmed ibn Hanbal took thirty thousand out of nearly one million traditions \(Tarikh Baghdad, Vol\. 4, p\. 419\-420; Tabaqat al\-Huffaz, Vol\. 2,

1. 17; Wafiyyat al\-A’yan, Vol\. 1, p\. 64; Tahthib al\-Tahthib, Vol\. 1, p\. 74\)\. But when this selection is studied, some traditions which come across

<a id="page698"></a>can, in no circumstances, be attributed to the Prophet \(h\)\. The result is

that a group of considerable number has cropped up among Muslims who, in view of these so\-called authoritative collections and true traditions, completely reject the evidentiary value of the traditions, \(For further reference see al\-Ghadr, Vol\. 5, pp\. 208\-378\)\.

The second category of narrators of traditions are those who, without appreciating the occasion or context, related whatever they could recollect, right or wrong\. Thus, in al\-Bukhari \(Vol\. 2, pp\. 100\-102; Vol\. 5,

1. 98\); Muslim \(Vol\. 3, pp\. 41\-45\); al\-Tirmidhi \(Vol\. 3, pp\. 327\-329\); al\-Nisa’i \(Vol\. 4, p\. 18\); Ibn Majah \(Vol\. 1, pp\. 508\-509\); Malik ibn Anas \(Al\-Muwatta’, Vol\. 1, p\. 234\); ash\-Shafi’i \(Ikhtilaful\-Hadith, on the side lines of Al\-Umm, Vol\. 7, p\. 266\); Abu Dawud \(Vol\. 3, p\. 194\); Ahmed ibn Hanbal \(Vol\. 1, pp\. 41, 42\) and al\-Baqyhaqi \(Vol\. 4, pp\. 72\-74\) in the chapter entitled ‘weeping over the dead’ it is stated that when \`Umar was wounded Suhayb came weeping to him, then Umar said the following: “O Suhayb\! If you weep mourn me, the Prophet \(h\) had said that the dead person is punished if his people mourn him\.”

After the death of Umar, this dialogue was mentioned to Aisha\. She said the following: “May Allah have mercy on \`Umar\! The Messenger of Allah did not say that mourning relatives brings about a punishment on the dead, but he said that the punishment of an unbeliever increases if people mourn him\.” After this, Aisha said that according to the Holy Quran, nobody had to bear the burden of another; so, how could the burden of those who weep be placed on the dead? After this, the following verse was quoted by Aisha: “No bearer of a burden shall bear the burden of another” \(Holy Quran, 6: 164; 17: 15; 35: 18; 39: 7; 53: 38\)\.

The wife of the Holy Prophet \(h\), Aisha, relates that once the Prophet \(h\) passed by a Jewish woman on account of whose death her people were weeping\. The Prophet \(h\) then remarked, “Her people are weeping over her, but she is undergoing punishment in the grave\.”

The third category of the narrators of traditions is that of those who heard some repealed traditions from the Prophet \(h\) but could not

get any change to hear the repealing traditions which he could relate to others\. An example of a repealing tradition is the statement of the Prophet \(h\) which also contains a reference to the repealed tradition, namely: “I

had prohibited you from visiting graves, but now you can visit them” \(Muslim, Vol\. 3, p\. 65; al\-Tirmidhi, Vol\. 3, p\. 370; Abu Dawud, Vol\. 3,

<a id="page699"></a>1. 218, 332; al\-Nisa’i, Vol\. 4, p\. 89; Ibn Majah, Vol\. 1, pp\. 500\-501; Malik ibn Anas, Vol\. 2, p\. 485; Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Vol\. 1, pp\. 145,452; Vol\. 3, pp\. 38, 63, 66, 237, 350; Vol\. 5, pp\. 350, 355, 356, 357, 359, 361; al\-Hakim, Al\-Mustadrak, Vol\. 1, pp\. 374\-376, and al\-Bayhaqi, Vol\. 4, pp\. 76\-77\)\. Herein, the permission to visit graves has repealed the previous restriction\. Now, those who heard only the repealed tradition continued acting according to it\.

The fourth category of narrators of traditions is that of those who were fully aware of the principles of justice, possessed intelligence and sagacity, knew the occasion when a tradition was first uttered \(by the Prophet \[h\]\) and were also acquainted with the repealing and the

repealed traditions, the particular and the general, and the temporary and the permanent\. They avoided falsehood and fabrication\. Whatever they heard remained preserved in their memory, and they conveyed it with exactness to others\. It is they whose traditions are the precious wealth of Islam, free from fraud and counterfeit, worthy of being trusted and acted upon\. That collection of traditions, which has been conveyed through trustworthy bosoms like that of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and has

remained free from cutting, curtailing, alteration, present Islam in its true form\. The status of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) in Islamic knowledge has been most certainly proved through traditions narrated from the Holy Prophet \(h\) such as:\.

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), Jabir ibn \`Abdullah, Ibn \`Abbas and Abdullah ibn \`Umar have narrated from the Holy Prophet \(h\) that he

said the following: “I am the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate\. Whoever wants to acquire \(my\) knowledge should come through its gate \(Al\-Mustadrak, Vol\. 3, pp\. 126\-127; Al\-Isti\`ab, Vol\. 3, p\. 1102; Usd al\-Ghaba, Vol\. 4, p\. 22; Tarikh Baghdad, Vol\. 2, p\. 377; Vol\. 4, p\. 348; Vol\. 7, p\. 172; Vol\. 11, pp\. 48\-50; Tadhkirah al\-Huffaz, Vol\. 4, p\. 28; Majma’ al\-Zawa’id, Vol\. 9, p\. 114; Tahthib al\-Tahthib, Vol\. 6, p\. 320; Vol\. 7, p\. 337; Lisan al\-Mizan, Vol\. 2, pp\. 122\-123; Tarikh al\-Khulafa’, p\. 170; Kanz al\-Ummal, Vol\. 6, pp\. 152, 156, 401; \`Umdat al\-Qari, Vol\. 7, p\. 631; Sharh al\-Mawahib al\-Laduniyya, Vol\. 3, p\. 143\)\.

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) and ibn Abbas have also cited the Holy Prophet \(h\) saying, “I am the store\-house of wisdom and Ali is its

door\. Whoever wants to acquire wisdom should come through its door” \(Hilyat al\-Awliya’, Vol\. 1, p\. 64; Masabih as\-Sunna, Vol\. 2, p\. 275;

<a id="page700"></a>Tarikh Baghdad, Vol\. 11, p\. 204; Kanz al\-Ummal, Vol\. 6, p\. 401; Al\-Riyad al\-Nadara, Vol\. 12, p\. 193\)\.

If only people could take the Prophet’s blessings through these sources of knowledge\! But it is a tragic chapter of history that although traditions are accepted through the Kharijites and enemies of the Prophet’s family, whenever the series of relaters includes the name of any individual from among the Prophet’s family, there is hesitation in accepting that tradition\.\.\.\!

**Sermon 210**

**The Greatness of Allah and the Creation of the Universe**

It is through the strength of Allah’s Greatness and Subtle Power of innovation that He made solid dry earth out of the water of the fathomless, compact and dashing ocean\. Then He made from it layers and separated them into seven skies they had been joined together\. So, they became stationary at His command, stopping at the limit fixed by Him\. He made the earth that is born deep blue, surrounded with water which is obedient to His command and to His awe while its flow has stopped due to fear of Him\.

He also created high hills, rocks and lofty mountains\. He put them in their positions and made them remain stationary\. Their peaks stretched into the air while their roots remained in the water\. In this way, He realized the mountains above the plains and fixed their foundations in the vast expanse wherever they stood\. He made their peaks high and their mass lofty\. He made them like pillars for the earth in which He fixed them like pegs\. Consequently, the earth became stationary lest it should bend with its inhabitants, or sink inwards with its burden, or shift from its positions\.

Therefore, glorified is Whoever stopped it after the flowing of its waters and solidified it after the watery state of its sides\. In this way He made it a cradle for His creatures and spread it for them in the form of a floor over the deep ocean which is stationary and does not move; it is fixed and does not flow\. Severe winds move it here and there and clouds draw up water from it\.

“Verily in this there is a lesson to him who fears \(Allah\) Holy Quran, 79: 26\)

**Sermon 211**

**About Those Who Give up Supporting Right**

O Lord\! Whoever listens to our utterance, which is just and which seeks the prosperity of religion and the worldly life, and who does not seek mischief, but rejects it after listening, then he certainly turns away from Your support and desists from strengthening Your religion\. We implore You to be the witness over him, and You are the greatest of all witnesses, and we make all those who inhabit Your earth and skies witness over him\. Thereafter, You alone can make us needless of his support and question him about his sin\.

**Sermon 212**

**Sublimity of Allah, Praising the Prophet \(h\)**

Praise be to Allah Who is above all similarity to the creatures, is above the words of describers\. He displays the wonders of His management for the onlookers, is hidden from the imagination of thinkers by virtue of the greatness of His glory, has knowledge without acquiring it, adding to it or drawing it \(from someone\) and Who is the One Who ordains all matters without reflecting or thinking\. He is such that gloom does not concern Him, nor does He seek light from brightness\. Night does not overtake Him, nor does the day pass over Him \(so as to affect Him in any manner\)\. His comprehension \(of things\) is not through eyes, and His knowledge is not dependent on being informed\.

**Part of the Same Sermon about the Prophet \(h\)**

Allah deputed the Prophet \(h\) with light and accorded him the

highest precedence in selection\. Through him, Allah united those who were divided, overpowered the powerful, overcame difficulties and leveled rugged ground, thus removing misguidance right and left\.

**Sermon 213**

**The Prophet’s Nobility of Descent**

I testify that He is just and implements justice\. He is the arbiter Who decides \(between right and wrong\)\. I also testify that Muhammad

<a id="page702"></a>\(h\) is His slave, Messenger and the Chief of His creatures\. When Allah

divided the line of descent, He placed his in the very best place\. Therefore, no evil\-doer ever shared with him, nor was any vicious person his partner\.

Beware\! Surely Allah, the Glorified One, has provided for virtue those who are suited for it, for truth pillars \(that support it\), and for obedience protection \(against deviation\) \. In every matter of obedience, you would find Allah, the Glorified One, succor that would speak through tongues and accords firmness to the hearts\. It has sufficiency for those who seek sufficiency, a cure for those who seek a cure\.

**Characteristics of the virtuous whose guidance must be emulated**

Be informed that, certainly, those servants of Allah Who preserve His knowledge offer protection to those things which He desires to be protected and make His springs flow \(for the benefit of others\)\. They contact each other with friendliness and meet each other with affection\. They drink water from cups that quench the thirst and return from the watering places fully satiated\. Misgiving does not affect them; backbiting does not gain ground with them\. In this way Allah has tied their nature with good manners\. Because of this, they love and meet each other\. They have become superior like seeds which are selected by taking some and throwing away others\. This selection has distinguished them, and the process of choosing has purified them\.

Therefore, man should secure honor by adopting these qualities\. He should fear the day of Doom before it arrives; he should appreciate the shortness of his life and the shortness of his sojourn in the place of stay which has only to last for his journey to the next abode\. He should, therefore, do something for his change over and for the known stages of his departure\. Blessed be whoever possesses a virtuous heart, who obeys one who guides him, desists from him who takes to ruin, catches the path of safety with the help of him who provides light \(of guidance\), obeying the leader who commands him, hastens towards guidance before its doors are closed, opens the door of repentance and removes the \(stain of\) sins\. He has certainly been put on the right path and guided towards the straight road\.

**A Prayer Which Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Often Recited**

Praise be to Allah Who made me such that I have not died nor am I sick, nor have my veins been infected with disease, nor have I been hauled up for my evil deeds, nor am I without progeny, nor have I forsaken my religion, nor do I disbelieve in my Lord, nor do I feel estranged with my faith, nor is my intelligence affected, nor have I been punished with the punishment of peoples before me\. I am a slave in Your possession, Lord, yet I have been guilty of excesses regarding my own soul\. You have exhausted Your pleas in my regard and I have no plea \(before You\) \. I have no power to take except what You give me, and I cannot evade except what You save me from\.

O Lord\! I seek Your protection from becoming destitute despite Your riches, from being misguided despite Your guidance, from being assaulted in Your realm and from being humiliated while authority rests with You\.

O Lord\! Let my soul be the first of the good things that You take from me and the first trust out of Your favors held in trust with me\.

O Lord\! We seek Your protection against turning away from Your command or rebellioning against Your religion, or being led away by our desires instead of by guidance that comes from You\.

**Sermon 215**

**Delivered at the Battle of Siffin Mutual Rights of the Ruler and the Ruled**

By placing me over your affairs, Allah, the Glorified One, has created my right over you and you, too, have a right over me like mine over you, a right is very vast in description but very narrow in equity\. It does not accrue to any person unless it accrues against him also, and right does not accrue against a person unless it also accrues in his favor\. If there is any right, which is only in favor of a person with no \(corresponding\) right accruing against him, it is solely for Allah, the Glorified One, not for His creatures by virtue of His might over His creatures, and by virtue of the justice permeating all His decrees\. Of course, He, the Glorified One, has created His right over creatures to

<a id="page704"></a>worship Him and has laid upon Himself \(the obligation of\) their reward equal to several times the recompense as a mark of His bounty and the generosity that He is capable of\.

Then, from His rights, He, the Glorified One, created certain rights for certain people against others\. He made them so in order to equate one with another\. Some of these rights produce other rights\. Some rights are such that they do not accrue except with others\. The greatest of these rights is that Allah, the Glorified One, has made obligatory the right of the ruler over the ruled, and the right of the ruled over the ruler\. This is an obligation which Allah, the Glorified One, has placed on each other\. He has made it the basis of their \(mutual\) affection and an honor for their religion\. Consequently, the ruled cannot prosper unless the rulers are sound, while the rulers cannot be sound unless the ruled are steadfast\.

If the ruled fulfil the rights of the ruler and the ruler fulfills their rights, then right attains the status of honor among them, the ways of religion become established, the signs of justice become fixed and the Sunnah gains currency\.

In this way, time would improve, the continuance of government would be expected and the aims of the enemies would be frustrated\. But if the ruled gain sway over the ruler, or if the ruler oppresses the ruled, then differences crop up in every word, signs of oppression appear, mischief creeps into the creed and the ways of the Sunnah are forsaken\. Then desires are acted upon, the commands \(of religion\) are discarded, diseases of the spirit become numerous and there is no hesitation in disregarding even great rights, nor in committing big wrongdoings\. In such circumstances, the virtuous are humiliated while the vicious are honored, and in this there are serious chastisements from Allah, the Glorified One, on the people\.

You should, therefore, counsel each other \(for the fulfillment of your obligations\) and cooperate with each other\. However extremely eager a person may be to secure the pleasure of Allah, and however fully he strives for it, he cannot totally discharge \(his obligation for\) obedience to Allah, the Glorified One, as is really due to Him\. It is an obligatory right of Allah over the people that they should advise each other to the best of their ability and cooperate with each other for the establishment of the truth among them\. Nobody, however great his status in the matter of the truth, and however advanced his distinction in religion may be, is above cooperation with regard to the obligations placed on him by Allah\. Again, no man, however small he may be regarded by others and however

<a id="page705"></a>humble he may appear before their eyes, is too low to cooperate or to be afforded cooperation in this matter\.

One of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s companions replied to him with a long speech of his own wherein he praised him much and referred to his listening to him and obeying him, whereas Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said the following:

If a man in his mind regards Allah’s glory as being high and believes in his heart that Allah’s status is sublime, then it is his right that on account of the greatness of these things, he should regard all other things as minor\. Among such persons he on whom Allah’s bounty is great and Allah’s favors are kind has a greater obligation because Allah’s bounty over any person does not increase without a corresponding increase in Allah’s right over him\.

In the view of virtuous people, the worst status of rulers is that it may be thought about them that they love glory and their affairs may be taken to be based on pride\. I would really hate that it may cross your mind that I love high praises or hear eulogies\. By the grace of Allah, I am not like this\. Even if I had loved to be mentioned like this, I would have given it up in submissiveness before Allah, the Glorified One, rather than accept greatness and sublimity to which He is more entitled\. Generally, people feel pleased at praise after good performances\. But do not mention to me handsome praise for the obligations which I have discharged towards Allah and towards you because of \(my\) fear about those obligations which I have not discharged and for issuing injunctions which could not be avoided\. Do not address me in the manner in which despots are addressed\.

Do not shun me as the people of passion are \(to be\) shunned\. Do not meet me with flattery, and do not think that I shall take it ill if a true thing is said to me because the person who feels disgusted when he hears the truth, or a just matter is placed before him, would find it more difficult to act upon them\. Therefore, do not abstain from saying the truth or pointing out a matter of justice because I do not regard myself to be above erring\. I do not escape erring in my actions except that Allah helps me \(in avoiding errors\) in matters in which He is more powerful than I\. Certainly, I and you are slaves owned by Allah, besides Whom there is no other Lord\. He owns our souls which we do not own\. He took us from where we were towards the means of our prosperity\. He turned our straying into guidance and gave us intelligence after blindness\.

<a id="page706"></a>That the innocence of angels is different from the innocence of man needs no detailed explanation\. The innocence of angels means that they do not possess the motive to sin, but the innocence of man means that, although he has human frailties and passions, he possesses the power to resist them and is not over\-powered by them so as to commit sins\. This very ability is called innocence and it prevents the rising up of personal passions and impulses\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s saying that he does not regard himself as being above erring refers to those human dictates and passions\. His saying that Allah helps him in avoiding errors refers to his being free of them\. The same tone is found in the Holy Quran in the Sura about Prophet Yusuf thus: “I do not excuse myself; verily \(one’s\) self \[nafs\] is bent on bidding \(him/her to commit\) evil, except such as my Lord has had mercy on; verily my Lord is oft\-Forgiving, all\-Merciful” \(Holy Quran 12: 53\)\.

Just as in this verse, due to the existence of exceptions, the first part of the Imam’s statement cannot be used to argue against his being free of having committed a sin\. Similarly, due to the existence of the exception that Allah helps him to avoid errors, the first part of the statement by Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib cannot be used to argue against his being free of having committed any sin; otherwise, the notion of the Prophet’s infallibility, too, would have to be rejected\. In the same way, the last sentence of this sermon should not be taken to mean that before the proclamation of Prophethood, he had been under the influence of pre\-Islamic beliefs, and that just as others had been unbelievers, he, too, might have been in darkness and misguidance\. This is so because since his birth, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) was brought up by the Prophet \(h\) because

of what the effect of such upbringing had permeated him\. It cannot, therefore, be conceived that whoever had since infancy trodden in the footprints of the Prophet \(h\) would deviate from the path of guidance even for one moment\. Thus, al\-Mas\`udi has written the following: “Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) never believed in any god than Allah so that there could be a question about his acceptance of Islam \[i\.e\. he was always Muslim\]\. He rather followed the Prophet \(h\) in all his actions and

\(virtually\) imitated him\. In this very state he attained the most” \(Muruj al\-Dhahab, Vol\. 2, p\. 3\)\.

Here, reference to those whom Allah led from darkness into guidance implies the individuals whom Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) was

addressing\. Ibn Abul\-Hadid writes the following in this regard: “The reference here is not to his own self because he had never been an unbeliever so as to have accepted Islam after that\. But with these words,

<a id="page707"></a>he is referring to those group of people whom he was addressing” \(Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 11, p\. 108\)\.

**Sermon 216**

**Excesses of the Quraishi Tribesmen**

O Lord\! I beseech You to take revenge on the tribesmen of Quraish and on those who are assisting them, for they have cut asunder my kinship and over\-turned my cup\. They have joined together to contest a right to which I was entitled more than anyone else\. They said to me: “If you get your right, that would be just, but if you are denied the right, that, too, would be just\. Endure it with sadness or kill yourself in grief\.” I looked around but found no one to shield me, protect me or help me except the members of my family\. I refrained from flinging them into death and, therefore, closed my eyes despite the dust, kept swallowing saliva despite \(the suffocation of\) grief and endured the pangs of anger although they were more bitter than colocynth and more grievous than the stabs of knives\.

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “This utterance of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has already appeared in an earlier Sermon \(No\. 171\), but I have repeated it here because of the difference of versions\.”

**Part of the Same Sermon about Those Who Went to Basra to Fight Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\)**

They marched on my officers and the custodians of the public treasury, which is still under my control, and on the people of a metropolis all of whom were obedient to me and were allied to me\. They created division among them, instigated their party against me and attacked my followers\. They killed a group of them by treachery, while another group took up swords against them and fought with the swords till they met Allah as adherents to the truth\.

**When Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Passed by the Corpses of**

**Talhah Ibn Ubaydullah and \`Abd Ar\-rahman Ibn Attab Ibn Asid, Who Were Both Killed in the Battle of Jamal, He Said the Following:**\.

<a id="page708"></a>Abu Muhammad \(Talhah\) lies here away from his own place\. By Allah, I did not like that the tribesmen of Quraish should lie killed under the stars\. I have avenged myself, together with the descendants of \`Abd Manaf, but the chief persons of Banu Jumah195 have slipped away from my grip\. They had stretched their necks towards a matter for which they were not suited and, therefore, their necks were broken before they reached their goal\.

**Sermon 218**

**Qualities of the God\-Fearing and the Pious**

He \(the believer\) kept his mind alive and killed \(the desires of\) his heart till his body became thin, his bulk turned light and a glory of extreme brightness shone for him\. It lighted the way for him and took him on the \(right\) path\. Different doors led him to the door of safety and the place of \(his permanent\) stay\. His feet, balancing his body, became fixed in the status of safety and comfort because he kept his heart \(in good deeds\) and pleased his Lord\.

**Sermon 219**

**Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Recited the Verse Saying,**

**“Engage \(Your\) Vying in Exuberance until You Come to the Graves” \(Holy Quran, 102: 1\-2\)1 Then Said the Following :**

195During the Battle of Jamal, a group of Banu Jumah was on the side of Aisha, yet the chief men of this group fled away from the battlefield\. Some of them were: Abdullah at\-Tawil ibn Safwan, Yahya ibn Hakim, Amir ibn Mas\`ud and Ayyub ibn Habib\. From this group \(Banu Jumah\), only two men were killed\.

1961\. The genesis of the revelation of this verse is that the tribes of Banu Abd Manaf and Banu Sahm began to boast to each other about the abundance of their wealth and the number of their tribesmen\. In order to prove that they had a greater number, each began to include their \[in the tally\] dead as well, whereupon this verse was revealed to the effect that abundance of riches and a majority in numbers has made you some people forgetful, so much so that they count the dead also with the living\. This verse is also taken to mean that abundance of riches and progeny has made some people oblivious \[of their religious obligations\] till they reached their graves\. But the utterance of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) supports the first meaning\.

<a id="page709"></a>How distant \(from achievement\) is their aim, how neglectful these visitors are and how difficult the affair is\! They have not taken lessons from things which are full of lessons, but they took them from far off places\. Do they boast on the dead bodies of their forefathers, or do they regard the number of dead persons as a ground for boasting about their number?\! They want to revive the bodies that have become lifeless and the movements that have ceased\. They are more entitled to be a source of admonishment than a source of pride and boasting\. They are more suitable for being a source of humility than of honor\.

They looked at them with weak\-sighted eyes, descending into the hollow of ignorance\. If they had asked about them from the dilapidated houses and empty courtyards, they would have said that they went into earth in the state of misguidance, and you, too, are heading ignorantly towards them\. You trample their skulls, raise constructions on their corpses, graze what they have left and live in houses which they have vacated\. The days \(that lie\) between them and you are also bemoaning you and reciting eulogies over you\.

They are your fore\-runners in reaching the goal\. They have arrived at the watering places before you\. They had positions of honor and plenty of pride\. They were rulers and holders of positions\. Now they have gone into the interstice where earth covers them from above and is eating their flesh and drinking their blood\. They lie in the hollows of their graves lifeless, growing no more, hidden, not to be found\. The approach of dangers does not frighten them; the adversity of circumstances does not grieve them\. They do not mind earthquakes, nor do they heed thunder\. They are gone and not expected back\. They are existent but unseen\. They were united but are now dispersed\. They were together and are now separated\.

Their records are unknown and their houses are silent, not because of length of time or distance of place, but because they have been made to drink the cup \(of death\) which has changed their speech into dumbness, their hearing into deafness and their movements into stillness\. It seems as if they are fallen in slumber\. They are neighbors not feeling affection for each other, friends who do not meet each other\. The bonds of their knowing each other have been worn out; the regards of their friendship have been cut asunder\. Everyone of them is, therefore, alone although they are a group; they are strangers though friends\. They are unaware of morning after a night and of evening after a day\. The night or

<a id="page710"></a>the day, when they departed, has become ever existent for them\.197 Or a night that would come without a day\. They found the dangers of their place of stay more serious than they had feared\. They witnessed that its signs were greater than they had guessed\. The two objectives \(namely Paradise and Hell\) have been stretched for them up to a point beyond the reach of either fear or hope\. Had they been able to speak, they would have become too dumb to describe what they witnessed or saw\.

Even though their traces have been wiped out and their news has stopped, eyes are capable of drawing a lesson, as they looked at them, intelligent ears heard them, and they spoke without uttering words\. So, they said that handsome faces have been destroyed and delicate bodies have been smeared by the earth\. We have put on a worn\-out shroud\. The narrowness of the grave has over\-whelmed us and strangeness has spread among us\. Our silent abodes have been ruined\. The beauty of our bodies has disappeared\. Our known features have become hateful\. Our stay in the places of strangeness has become long\. We do not get relief from pain nor widening from narrowness\.

Now, if you portray them in your mind, or if the curtains concealing them are removed for you, in such a state, when their ears have lost their power, turning deaf, their eyes have been filled with dust, sinking down, their tongues which were very active have been cut into pieces, their hearts which were ever wakeful have become motionless in their chests, in every limb of theirs a peculiar decay has taken place which has deformed it and paved the way for calamity towards it\.\.\., all these lie powerless, with no hand to help them, no heart to grieve over them, it is then that you would certainly realize the grief of their hearts and the dirt of their eyes\.

Every trouble of theirs is such that its condition does not change and the distress does not clear away\. How many a prestigious body and amazing beauty which earth has swallowed, although when in the world he enjoyed abundant pleasures and was nurtured in honor? He clung to enjoyments \(even\) in the hour of grief\. If distress befell him, he would

197This means that for whoever dies in the day, it is always day, whereas for whoever dies in the night, the darkness of night never dispels because they are at a place where there is no turning of the moon and the sun and no rotation of the nights and the days\. The same meaning has been expressed by a poet like this:

_There is sure to be a day without a night,_

<a id="page711"></a>seek refuge in consolation through the pleasures of life, playing and being indulged in games\. He was laughing at the world while the world was laughing at him because of a life full of forgetfulness\. Then time trampled him like thorns, the days weakened his energy and death began to look at him from near\. Then he was overtaken by a grief which he had never felt; ailments appeared in place of the health which he previously used to enjoy\.

He then turned to that with which the physician had made him familiar, namely suppressing the hot \(diseases\) with cold \(medicines\) and curing the cold with hot doses\. But the cold things did nothing save aggravate the hot ailments, while the hot ones did nothing except to increase the coldness\. Nor did he acquire temperateness in his constitution\. Rather, every ailment of his increased till his physicians became helpless, his attendants grew loathsome and his own people felt disgusted from describing his disease, avoided answering those who inquired about him and quarreled in front of him about the serious news which they were concealing from him\. Thus, someone would say that his condition is what it is and would console them with hopes of his recovery, while another would advocate patience on missing him, recalling to them the calamities that had befallen the earlier generations\.

In this state, when he was getting ready to depart from the world and leave his beloved ones, such a serious choking overtook him that his senses became bewildered and the dampness of his tongue dried up\. Now, there was many an important question whose reply he knew about but he could not utter and many a voice that was painful for his heart that he heard but remained \(unmoved\), as though he was deaf to the voice of either, an elder whom he used to respect, or a youth whom he used to caress\. The pangs of death are too hideous to be covered by description or be appreciated by the hearts of the people in this world\.

**Sermon 220**

**Delivered after reciting this verse: “\.\.\.therein are men whom neither merchandise nor any sale diverts from the remembrance of Allah and are constantly praying and paying the poor\-rate declare glory to Him in the mornings and the evenings; they fear the Day when the hearts and eyes shall writhe in anguish” \(Holy Quran, 24: 36\-37\) \.**\.

<a id="page712"></a>Certainly, Allah, the Glorified One, the Sublime, has made His remembrance the light for the hearts which hear, with its help, despite deafness, see with its help despite blindness and become submissive with its help despite unruliness\.

In all the periods when there were no prophets, there have been persons with whom Allah, precious are His bounties, whispered through their wits and spoke through their minds\. With the help of the bright awakening of their ears, eyes and hearts did they keep reminding others of the remembrance of the Days of Allah, making others fear Him with piety; they were like guide posts in the wildernesses\. Whoever adopts the middle way, they praise his ways and give him the tidings of deliverance\. But whoever goes right and left, they vilify his ways and frighten him with ruin\. In this way, they served as lamps in the darkness and guides through these doubts\.

There are some people who are devoted to the remembrance \(of Allah\)\. They have adopted it in place of worldly matters so that commerce or trade does not turn them away from it\. They pass their life in it\. They speak into the ears of neglectful persons, warning against matters regarded as unlawful by Allah, ordering them to practice justice while they themselves keep practicing it\. They keep other away from what is unlawful while they themselves refrain from it\. It is as though they have finished the journey of this world towards the next and have beheld what lies beyond it\. Consequently, they have become acquainted with all that befell them in the interstice during their long stay the rein and the Day of Judgement fulfills its promises for them\. Therefore, they removed the curtain from these things for the people of the world, till it was as though they were seeing what people did not see and hearing what people did not hear\.

If you picture them in your mind in their admirable positions and well\-known sittings, when they have opened the records of their actions and are prepared to render an account of themselves with regard to the small as well as the big things they were ordered to do but failed to do, or were ordered to refrain from but they indulged therein, so they realized the weight of their burden \(of bad deeds\) on their backs and felt too weak to bear them\. Then they wept bitterly and spoke to each other while still crying and beseeching Allah in repentance and acknowledgment \(of their shortcomings\)\.\.\., you would find them to be symbols of guidance and lamps in the darkness\. Angels will be surrounding them, peace will be descending upon them, the gates of heaven will be opened for them, and positions of honor will be assigned to them in the place of which Allah

<a id="page713"></a>had informed them\. Therefore, He has appreciated their actions and praised their status\. They call Him and breathe in the air of forgiveness\. They are ever needy of His bounty\. They remain humble before His greatness, the length of their grief has pained their hearts and prolonging their grief\. They knock at every door of inclination towards Allah\. They ask the One Whom generosity does not impoverish and from Whom those who approach Him do not get disappointed\.

Therefore, take account of yourself for your own sake because the account of others will be taken by One other than you\.

**Sermon 221**

**Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) recited this verse: “O you man\!**

**What has beguiled you from your Lord, the most Gracious One?” \(Holy Quran, 82: 6\)\. Then he said the following :**\.

The addressee \(in this verse\) has no argument; his excuse is most deceptive\. He is resigning himself to ignorance\.

O man\! What has emboldened you to \(commit\) sins? What had deceived you about your Lord, and what has made you satisfied with the destruction of your own soul? Is there no cure for your ailment or no awakening from your sleep? Do you not have pity on yourself as you have on others? Generally, when you see anyone exposed to the heat of the sun, you cover him with a shade\. Or if you see anyone afflicted with grief that pains his body, you weep out of pity for him\. What has then made you patient over your own disease? What has made you insistent on your own afflictions, and what has consoled you from weeping over yourself although your life is the most precious of all lives to you? Why does not the fear of an ailment that may befall you in the night keep you awake although you lie on the way to Allah’s wrath due to your sins?

You should cure the disease of languor in your heart with determination and the sleep of neglectfulness in your eyes with wakefulness\. Be obedient to Allah and love His remembrance\. Picture yourself running away while He is approaching you\. He is calling you to His forgiveness and concealing your faults with His kindness, while you are fleeing away from Him, seeking others\. Certainly, Great is Allah the powerful Who is so generous, and how humble and weak you are yet still so bold to commit disobedience to Him although you live in His protection and undergo changes of life in the expanse of His kindness\. He

<a id="page714"></a>does not exclude you from His kindness and does not remove you from His protection\. In fact, you have not been without His kindness even for one single moment, whether it be a favor that He conferred upon you, or a sin of yours that He concealed, or a calamity that He has warded off from you\. What is your idea about Him if you had obeyed Him? By Allah, if this had been the case with two persons equal in power and matching in might \(one being inattentive and the other showering favors upon you\), you would then have been the first to indict yourself of having a bad conduct and committing evil deeds\.

I truthfully say that the world has not deceived you but you have had yourself deceived by it\. The world opened to you the curtains and divulged to you \(everything\) equally\. And in all that, it forewarned you about the troubles befalling your bodies and the decay in your power\. It has been too true and faithful in promise and did not speak a lie to you or deceive you\. There are many who advise you about it but they are blamed, and they speak the truth about it but they are opposed\. If you understand the world by means of dilapidated and far\- reaching power of drawing lessons, you would find it like one who is kind to you and cautious about you\. It is good abode for whoever does not like it as an abode, a good place of stay for whoever does not regard it a permanent home for stay\.

Only those who run away from this world today will tomorrow be regarded as virtuous\. When an earthquake occurs, the Day of Resurrection approaches with all its severity, people of every worshiping place cling to it, while all the devotees cling to the objective of their devotion as all followers cling to their leaders\. On that Day, even the act of one looking at the sky \[wondering about what it contains and about the One Who created everything\] or that of the sound of a footstep on the ground \[of one who goes to perform a good deed\] will be fully rewarded through His Justice and Equity\. On that Day, many an argument will prove void and a contention for excuses will stand rejected\.

You, therefore, should now adopt for yourselves the course with which your excuse may be sound and your plea may be heard\. Take from the transient things of this world that which will stay for you \(in the next world\)\. Provide for your journey\. Keep your gaze on the brightness of deliverance, and prepare the saddles \(for setting off\)\.

**About Keeping Aloof from Oppression and Misappropriation\. Aqil’s Condition of Poverty and Destitution**

By Allah, I would rather remain all night long wake on the as\-sa’dan thorns \(a plant having sharp prickles\), or be driven in chains as a prisoner, than meet Allah and His Messenger on the Day of Judgement having oppressed anyone or usurped anything of the world’s wealth\. How can I oppress anyone for a world that is fast moving towards destruction, then I shall remain in the earth for a long time?

By Allah, I certainly saw \(my brother\) Aqil fallen a prey to destitution\. He asked me for one saa’ \(about three kilograms’ weight\) of wheat, and I also saw his children with dishevelled hair and a dusty countenance due to starvation, as though their faces had been blackened by indigo\. He came to me several times and repeated his request to me again and again\. I heard him and he thought I would sell my faith to him and follow his path, leaving my own\. Then I heated a piece of iron and took it near his body so that he might learn a lesson from it\. He cried as a person in protracted illness the cries of pain, and he was about to get burnt by its branding\. Then I said to him, “May mourning women mourn you, O Aqil\! Do you cry on account of this \(heated\) iron which has been made by a man for sport, while you are driving me towards the Fire which Allah, the Powerful, has prepared as a sign of His wrath? Should you cry from pain, but I should not cry from its flame?\!”

A more strange incident than this is that of a man198 who came to us in the night with a closed flask full of honey paste, but I disliked it as though it was the saliva or vomit of a serpent\. I asked him whether it was a reward, or zakat \(poor\-tax\), or charity, for we, members of the Prophet’s family \(x\) are forbidden from receiving them\. “Childless women may

mourn you\! Have you come to deviate me from the religion of Allah, or are you mad, or have you been overpowered by some jinn, or are you speaking senselessly?\!”

By Allah, even if I were to be given all the domains of the seven heavens with all that exists under the skies in order to disobey Allah to the extent of snatching one grain of barley from an ant, I would never do it\. For me, your world is lighter than the leaf in the mouth of a locust that is

<a id="page716"></a>chewing it\. What has Ali to do with bounties that will pass away and pleasures that will not last? We seek the protection of Allah from the slip of wisdom, from the evils of falling into error, and from Him do we seek succor\.

**Sermon 223**

**Supplication**

O Lord\! Preserve \(the grace of\) my face with easiness of life and do not disgrace my countenance with destitution lest I should have to beg a livelihood from those who beg from You, try to seek the favor of Your evil creatures, engage myself in praising those who give me and be tempted to abuse those who do not give to me, although behind all these You are the master of giving and denying\.

**Transience of the World, the Helplessness of Those Entombed**

This \[world\] is a house surrounded by calamities and is well\-known for deceitfulness\. Its conditions do not last and those who inhabit it do not remain safe\. Its conditions change and its ways alternate\. Life in it is blameworthy and safety in it is non\-existent\. Yet its people are targets; it strikes them with its arrows and destroys them with death\.

Be informed, O servants of Allah, that certainly you and all the things in this world in your possession are treading on the paths of those \(who were\) before you\. They lived longer life\-spans, had more populated houses and left behind more lasting tracks\. Their voices have become silent, their movements have become stationary, their bodies have become rotten, their houses have become empty and their traces have become obliterated\. Their magnificent places and spread\-out carpets were changed into stones, laid\-in \-blocks and cave\-like dug\-out graves whose very foundation is based on ruins and whose construction has been made with soil\. Their positions are contiguous, but those settled in them are like far\-flung strangers\. They are among the people of their area but feel lonely; they are free from having to work but are still engaged \(in activity\)\. They feel no attachment to homelands, nor do they keep contact with each

<a id="page717"></a>other, as neighbors do, despite nearness of neighborhood\. And how can they meet each other when decay has ground them with its chest and stones and earth have eaten them up?

It is as though you too have gone where they have gone, the same sleeping place has caught you, the same place has detained you\. What would then be your status when your affairs reach their end and graves are turned upside down?

“Every soul shall realize what it has sent before, and they shall be brought back to Allah, their true Lord, and what they did fabricate \(of false deities\) would vanish from them” \(Holy Quran, 10: 30\)\.

**Sermon 225**

**Supplication**

O Lord\! You are the most attached to Your lovers and the most ready to assist those who trust in You\. You see them in their concealment, know whatever is in their conscience and are aware of the extent of their intelligence\. Consequently, their secrets are open to You and their hearts are eager from You\. If loneliness bores them, Your remembrance gives them solace\. If distresses befall them, they solicit Your protection because they know that the reins of affairs are in Your hands and that their movements depend upon Your commands\.

O Lord\! If I am unable to express my request or cannot see my needs, then guide me towards my betterment\. Take my betterment and my heart towards the sound goal\. This is not against \(the mode of\) Your guidance nor anything new against Your ways of support\.

O Lord\! Deal with me with Your forgiveness and do not deal with me according to Your justice\.

**About a Companion Who Passed Away from this World Before the Occurrence of Troubles**

May Allah reward such\-and\-such man who straightened the curve, cured the disease, abandoned mischief and established the Sunnah\. He departed \(from this world\) with untarnished clothes and few

<a id="page718"></a>shortcomings\. He achieved the goodness \(of this world\) and remained safe from its evils\. He adhered to Allah’s obedience and feared Him as He deserves to be feared\. He went away leaving the people in dividing ways wherein the misled cannot obtain guidance and the guided cannot attain certainty\.

Who is this man to whom the Imam \(x\) is referring? Ibn Abul\-

Hadid has written \(in Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 14, pp\. 3\-4\) that reference here is to another \`Umar \[not to caliph \`Umar\] and that these sentences have been uttered in his praise as indicated by the word \`Umar’ written under the phrase ‘such\-and\-such’ in Sayyid ar\- Radi’s own handwriting in the manuscript of Nahjul\-Balagha which he wrote\. This man is identified in Abul\-Hadid’s statement, but it is to be seen that if Sayyid ar\-Radi had written the word \`Umar’ by way of explanation it should have existed, as other explanations by him have so remained, in those versions which have been copied from his manuscript\. Even now, there exists in Mosul University, Iraq, the oldest manuscript of Nahjul\-Balagha written by the famous calligraphist Yaqut al\-Musta’simi\. But nobody has afforded any clue to this explanation of Sayyid ar\-Radi\! Even if the view of Ibn Abul\-Hadid is accepted, it will be viewed as representative of the personal opinion of Sayyid ar\-Radi which may serve as a supplementary argument in support of an original argument\. But this personal view cannot be accorded any significance\.

It is strange how two and a half centuries after the demise of Sayyid ar\-Radi, that is, in the seventh century A\.H\., Ibn Abul Hadid should make the statement that the reference here is to \`Umar and that Sayyid ar \-Radi himself had so indicated\. The result: Some other annotaters also followed the same line\. But the contemporaries of Sayyid ar\-Radi who also wrote about Nahjul\-Balagha have given no such indication in their writings although, as contemporaries, they should have had better information about Sayyid ar\-Radi’s writing\. Thus, allama Ali ibn Nasir, who was a contemporary of Sayyid ar\-Radi and who wrote an annotation of Nahjul\-Balagha under the title A’lam Nahjul\-Balagha, writes the following with regard to this sermon: “Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has praised one of his own companions for his good conduct\. The man

had died before the troubles that arose following the death of the Prophet of Allah \(k\)\.”

This is supported by the annotations of Nahjul\-Balagha written by allama Qutbu’d\-Din ar\-Rawandi \(d\. 573 A\.H\.\)\. Ibn Abul\-Hadid \(Vol\. 14, p\. 4\) and ibn Maytham al\-Bahrani \(in Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 4, p\.

<a id="page719"></a>1. have quoted his following view: “By this man, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) refers to one of his own companions who died before the mischief and disruption that occurred following the death of the Prophet of Allah \(k\)\.”

Allama al\-Hajj al\-Mirza Habibullah al\-Khoei is of the opinion that the person under discussion is Malik ibn al\-Harith al\-Ashtar\. He bases his view on the ground that after the assassination of Malik, the situation of the Muslim community was such as Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) explains in this sermon\.”

Al\-Khoei adds that: “Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has praised

Malik repeatedly such as in his letter to the people of Egypt sent through Malik when he \[Malik\] was appointed \[by Commander of the Faithful Ali \(x\)\] as the provincial governor of Egypt\. It is similar to his utterances

when the news of Malik’s assassination reached him\. He then said the following: ‘Malik?\! Who is Malik? If Malik was a stone, he was hard and solid; if he was a rock, he was a great rock which had no parallel\. Women have become barren to give birth to such as Malik\.’ Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had even expressed in some of his utterances that ‘Malik was to

me as I was to the Holy Prophet \(h\)\.’ Therefore, one who possesses such

a status certainly deserves such attributes and even beyond that” \(Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 14, pp\. 374\-375\)\.

If these words had been about \`Umar, and if there was some trustworthiness about it, Ibn Abul\-Hadd will have recorded the authority or tradition, and it will have existed in history and been known among the people\. But here nothing is found to prove the statement except a few self \-concocted events\. Thus, about the pronouns in the words “khayraha and sharraha”, he takes them to refer to the caliphate and writes that these words can apply only to one who enjoys power and authority because without authority it is impossible to establish the Sunnah or prevent the innovation\. This is the gist of the argument which he has advanced on this occasion, although there is no proof to establish that the antecedent of this pronoun is the caliphate\. It can rather refer to the world \(when Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \[x\] says:\) “He achieved good \[of this world\] and remained

safe from its evils,” and this will be in accord with the context\. Again, to regard authority as a condition for the safeguarding of people’s interest and the propagation of the Sunnah means to close the door to prompting others to good and dissuading them from evil, although Allah has assigned this duty to a group of the people without the condition of

<a id="page720"></a>authority: “There should be among you a group \[umma\] who calls people to virtue and enjoin what is good and forbid wrong, and these shall be the successful ones” \(Holy Quran, 3: 104\)\.

Similarly, it is transmitted that the Prophet \(h\) said, “So long as

people go on promoting righteousness and dissuading evil and assisting each other in virtue and piety, they will remain in righteousness\.”

Again, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), in the course of a will, says

the following in general terms: “Establish the pillars of the Unity of Allah and the Sunnah, and keep both these lamps \[of guidance\] aflame\.”

In these sayings, there is no hint that this obligation cannot be discharged without authority\. Facts also tell us that \(despite army, force, power and authority\) the rulers could not prevent evil, nor could they propagate virtue to the extent to which some unknown godly persons were able to inculcate moral values by imprinting their morality on heart and minds, although they were not backed by any army or force, and they did not have any tools of power save their way of living in destitution\. Undoubtedly, authority and control can bend heads down before it, but it is not necessary that it should also pave the way for virtue in hearts\. History demonstrates that most of the rulers destroyed the features of Islam\. Islam’s existence and progress have been possible, thanks to the efforts of those helpless persons who possessed nothing save poverty and destitution\.

If it is emphasized that the reference here should only be to a ruler\. But why should it not be taken to refer to a companion of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) who had been a provincial governor, such as Salman al\-

Farsi for whose burial Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) made the trip all the way to al\-Mada’in, and why is it not possible that Imam Ali ibn AbÅ Talib \(x\) might have uttered these words after the burial as a comment on

his life and way of governing Mada’in? However, to believe that they are about Umar \[ibn al\-Khattab\] is without any proof whatsoever\. In the end, Ibn Abul \-Hadid quotes the following statements of \(the historian\) al\-Tabari to back his hypothesis: “It is related from al\-Mughirah ibn Shu’bah that when Umar died, Ibn Abu Khath’amah said crying, ‘O Umar\! You were the man who straightened the curve, removed the ills, destroyed mischief, revived the Sunnah, remained chaste and departed without entangling \[yourself\] in evils’\.” According to al\- Tabari, al \-Mughirah related saying, “When Umar was buried, I came to Ali and I wanted to hear something from him about \`Umar\. So, on my arrival, Imam Ali ibn

<a id="page721"></a>Abu Talib \(x\) came out in this state: He was wrapped in one cloth after

bathing and was jerking the hair of his heard and beard\. He had no doubt that the Caliphate would come to him\. On this occasion he said, ‘May Allah have mercy on Umar ibn Abu Khath’amah\. He has correctly said that he enjoyed the good things of the Caliphate and remained safe from its evils\. By Allah\! He did not say it himself but was made to say it” \(al\-Tabari, Vol\. 1, p\. 2763; Ibn Abul\-Hadid, Vol\. 12, p\. 5; Ibn Kathir, Vol\. 7, p\. 140\)\.

The relater of this event is al\-Mughirah ibn Shu’bah who was saved from the penalty of having committed adultery with Umm Jamil by \`Umar \[ibn al\-Khattab\] despite the testimony against him\. His openly abusing Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) in Kufa under Mu\`awiyah’s behest

are admitted facts of history\. On this ground, what weight his statements can carry is quite clear\. From the factual point of view also, this story cannot be accepted\. Al\-Mughirah’s statement that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had no doubt about his Caliphate runs contrary to the facts\.

What were the factors from which he made this assumption when the actual facts were to the contrary? If the Caliphate was certain for anyone at the time, Othman was then the caliph\. Thus, at the Consultative Committee, Abd ar\-Rahman ibn \`Awf said to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), “O Ali\! Do not create a situation against yourself, for I have observed

and consulted the people and they all want Othman” \(al\-Tabari, Vol\. 1, p\.

2786; Ibn al\-Athir, Vol\. 3, p\. 71; Abul\-Fida’, Vol\. 1, p\. 166\)\.

Consequently, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) was sure not to be

made the caliph as has already been stated on the authority of al\-Tabari’s Tarikh, under the sermon of the Camel’s Foam \(ash\-Shaqshaqiyya\)\. In other words, on seeing the names of the members of the Consultative Committee, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) told al\-Abbas ibn \`Abdul\-

Muttalib that the caliphate could not be given to anyone except to Othman since all the powers had been given to Abd ar\-Rahman ibn \`Awf who was Othman’s brother\-in\-law \(sister’s husband\) and Sa\`d ibn Abu Waqqas was a relative and tribesman of \`Abd ar\-Rahman\. These two would collaborate to give the caliphate to him\.

At this stage, the question arises as to why al\-Mughirah urged Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) to say something about \`Umar\. If he knew that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had good impressions about Umar, he should have also known his own\. But if he thought that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) did not entertain good impressions about him, then the purpose

<a id="page722"></a>of his asking Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) to do so would be none other

than that whatever he might say he would\. By speaking his mind, an atmosphere against him would be created, and he would make the members of the Consultative Committee suspicious of him\. The views of the members of the Consultative Committee are well understood from the very fact that by putting the condition of following the conduct of the first two Caliphs for electing the caliph, they thus demonstrated their adherence to and preference of both men\. In these circumstances, when al\-Mughirah tried to play this trick, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said just

by way of relating a fact that \`Umar achieved the good \(of this world\) and remained safe from its evil\. This sentence has no connotation of praise or censure\. \`Umar did in his days enjoy all kinds of advantages, while his period was free from the mischief that cropped up soon thereafter\. Having recorded this statement, Ibn Abul\-Hadid writes the following: “From this event, the belief gains momentum that in this utterance, the allusion is towards Umar\.”

If the utterance refers to the statement of Ibn Abu Khat’amah about which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has said that they were not the

heart’s voice of the man but he was made to utter them, then there is no doubt that the reference was to \`Umar\. But the view that these words were uttered by Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) in praise of \`Umar \[ibn al\-Khattab\]

is not at all established\. Rather, from this incident, it is evidently proven that these words were uttered by Ibn Abu Khath’amah\. Allah alone knows on what ground the words of Ibn Abu Khath’amah are quoted\. Yet some people dare to argue that these words were uttered by Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) about \`Umar\.\.\.\!

It seems that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) had uttered these words

about someone on some occasion, then Ibn Abu Khath’amah used similar words on Omer’s death\. Yet even then, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s words were taken to be in praise of Umar\! Otherwise, no mind except a deranged one can argue that the words uttered by Ibn Abu Khath’amah should be interpreted as being said by Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) in

praise of \`Umar\. Can it be expected, after \(a glance at\) the sermon of the Camel’s Foam, that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) might have uttered these words? Again, it is worth considering whether these words had been uttered by Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) on \`Omer’s death, then at the

Consultative Committee, when he refused to follow the conduct of the \(first\) two Caliphs, it should have been said to him that only the other day he has said that \`Umar had established the Sunnah and put an end to

<a id="page723"></a>innovations\. So, since his conduct was in agreement with the Sunnah, what was the sense in accepting the Sunnah but refusing to follow his own conduct?\!

**Allegiance to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) for the Caliphate\.**

**\(A similar sermon in somewhat different version has already been cited\.\)**

You drew out my hand towards you so you may swear the oath of allegiance to me, but I held it back\. And you stretched it again, but I contracted it\. Then you crowded over me as the thirsty camels crowd on the watering cisterns on their being taken there, so much so that shoes were torn, shoulder\-cloths fell away and the weak got trampled upon\. And the happiness of people on their allegiance to me was so manifest, small children felt joyful, the old staggered \(up to me\) for it, the sick, too, reached for it helter skelter and young girls ran for it even without veils\.

**Fear of Allah, an Account of Those Who Remain Apprehensive of Death and Adopt Asceticism**

Certainly, fear of Allah is the key to guidance, a provision for the next world, freedom from every kind of slavery, and deliverance from all ruin\. With its help, the seeker succeeds, and whoever makes for safety escapes and achieves his aims\.

Perform good deeds while such deeds are being raised \(in value\), repentance can be of benefit, prayer can be heard, conditions are peaceful and the pens \(of the two angels\) are in motion \(to record the deeds\)\. Hasten towards \(virtuous\) actions before the change \(to old age\) or to a lingering illness, or to a snatching death\. Certainly, death will end your enjoyments, mar your pleasures and puts an end to your goals\. It is an unwanted visitor, an invincible adversary and a non\-discriminating killer\. Its ropes have entrapped you, its evils have surrounded you, its arrowheads have aimed at you, its sway over you is great, its oppression on you is continuous and the chance of its missing you is remote\.

Very soon you will be overwhelmed with the gloom of its shades, the severity of its illness, the darkness of its distresses, the senseless

<a id="page724"></a>utterances of its pangs, the grief of its destruction, the darkness of its encompassing and the bitterness of its taste\. It will seem as if it has come to you out of a sudden, silenced those who were whispering to you, separated your group, destroyed your doings, devastated your houses and altered your successors to distribute your estate among the chief relatives who were of no benefit to you, or the grieved near ones who could not protect \(you\), or those rejoicing who did not lament \(you\)\.

Therefore, it is incumbent upon you to strive\. Exert your effort, equip yourself, get ready and provide yourself from the place of provision\. And let not the life of this world deceive you as it deceived those before you from among the past generations and by\-gone periods \- those who extracted its milk, benefitted from its neglectfulness, passed a long time and turned its new things into old \(by living long\)\. Their abodes turned into graves and their wealth into inheritable estate\. They do not know who came to them \(at their graves\)\. They do not pay heed to those who weep over them nor respond to those who call upon them\. Therefore, beware of this world, for it is treacherous, deceitful and cheating\. It gives and takes back, covers with clothes and uncovers\. Its pleasure does not last, its hardship does not end and its calamity does not terminate\.

**Part of the same sermon about the ascetics**:

They are from among the people of this world but are not its people because they remain in it as though they do not belong to it\. They act herein upon what they observe and hasten her in \(to avoid\) what they fear\. Their bodies move among the people of the next world\. They see that the people of this world attach importance to the death of their bodies while they themselves attach more importance to the death of the hearts of the living\.

**Abdullah ibn Zama’ah, who was one of the followers of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\), came to him once during his Caliphate to ask for some money\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said the following to him:**

This money does not belong to me, nor does it belong to you\. It is the collective property of the Muslims and the acquisition of their swords\. If you had taken part with them in their fighting, you would have had a share equal to theirs; otherwise, the earning of their hands cannot be for other than their own mouths\.

**On the Inability of Ja’dah Ibn Hubayrah Al\-Makhzumi1 to**

**Deliver a Sermon\. About Speaking the Truth **:

Be informed that the tongue is part of a man’s body\. If the man desists, speech will not cooperate with him, and when he dilates, speech will not give him time to stop\. Certainly, we are the masters of speech\. Its veins are fixed in us and its branches are hanging over us\.

Be informed, may Allah have mercy on you, that you are living at a time when those who speak about right are few, when tongues are loath to utter the truth and those who stick to what is right are humiliated\. The people of this time are engaged in disobedience\. Their youths are wicked, their old men are sinful, their learned men are hypocrites and their speakers are psychopathics\. Their youths do not respect their elders and their rich do not support the destitute\.

199Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) asked his nephew \(sister’s son\), Ja’dah

ibn Hubayrah al\-Makhzumi, once to deliver a sermon\. But when the man stood up to speak, his tongue faltered and he could utter nothing, whereupon Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) ascended the pulpit to speak and delivered a long sermon out of which a few sentences have been recorded here by Sayyid ar\-Radi\.

**Sermon 232**

**Causes of Differences in the Features and Traits of People**

Di’bil al\-Yamami has related from Ahmed ibn Qutaybah, and the latter from Abdullah ibn Yazid, and he from Malik ibn Dihyah who said, “We were with Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) when a discussion arose about the differences among men \(in features and conduct\), so Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) said the following:

They differ among themselves because of the sources of their clay \(from which they have been created\)\. This is so because they are either from salty soil or sweet soil or from rugged earth or soft earth\. They resemble each other on the basis of the affinity of their soil and differ according to its difference\. Therefore, sometimes a person of handsome features is weak in intelligence, a tall stature person is of low courage, a virtuous person is ugly in appearance, a short stature person is far\-sighted, a good\-natured person has an evil trait, a person of perplexed heart has a bewildering mind and a sharp\-tongued person has a wakeful heart\.

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) has ascribed the differences in

features and characters of people to the differences in the clay from which they are created and according to which their features are shaped and their characters are formed\. Therefore, to the extent that their clay of origin is akin, their mental and imaginative tendencies, too, will be similar, and to the extent by which they differ, there will be a difference in their inclinations and tendencies\. By “origins” of a thing are meant those things on which its coming into existence depends, but they do not have to be its cause\. The word “teen” is the plural of “teenah” which means “origin” or “basis”\. Here, “teenah” means semen which, after passing through various stages of development, emerges into a human shape\. Its origin means those constituents from which those items are created which help in the formation of semen\. Thus, by salty, sweet, soft or hard soil, the reference is to these elementary ingredients\. Since those elementary ingredients carry different properties, the semen growing out of them will also bear different characteristics and propensities which will \(eventually\) show forth in the differences in features and in the conduct of those born out of it\.

Ibn Abul\-Hadid has written \(in Sharh Nahjul\-Balagha, Vol\. 13, p\.

1. that the phrase “origins of teenah” implies those preservative factors which are different in their properties as Plato and other philosophers

<a id="page727"></a>have held\. The reason for calling them “origins of teenah” is that they serve as an asylum for the human body and prevent the elements from diffusion\. Just as the existence of a thing hinges on its essence, in the same way the existence of this body, which is made up of elements, depends on preservative factors\. So long as the preservative factor exists, the body, too, is safe from disruption and disintegration and the elements are also immune to diffusion and dispersal\. When it leaves the body, the elements also get dispersed\.

According to this explanation, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s words will mean that Allah has created different original elements of which some are vicious and some are virtuous, some are weak and some are strong\. Every person will act according to his/her original element\. If there is any similarity in the inclinations of two persons, it is attributed to their original element\. In it, they are similar\. And when their tendencies differ, it is because their original elements are not similar\. But this conclusion is not correct because Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s words do not only refer to differences in conduct and behavior but also in features and shapes\. The differences of features and shapes cannot be the result of differences in original elements\.

In any case, whether the original elements make up the cause of differences in features and in one’s conduct, or whether the elementary ingredients are the cause, these words appear to lead to the negation or volition \[of such an assumption\]\. They attempt to prove the dominance, the upper\-hand, \(of destiny\) over human actions\. If man’s capacity for thinking and acting is dependent on one’s “teenah”, then he will be compelled to behave himself in a fixed way on account of which he will neither deserve praise for good deeds nor be held blameworthy for bad ones\. But this hypothe sis is incorrect because it is well established that just as Allah knows everything in creation after its coming into being, in the same way, He knew it before its creation\. Thus, He knew what actions man would perform of his free will and what he could leave\. Therefore, Allah gave him the ability to act according to his free will and created him from a suitable “teenah”\. This “teenah” is not the cause of his actions so as to snatch away from him his free will\. But the meaning of creating from suitable “teenah” is that Allah does not by force stand in man’s way but allows him to tread the path which he wants of his own free will\.

**Spoken When Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Was Busy in the Funeral Ablution \(Ghusl\) and Shrouding of the Holy Prophet \(h\)**

May my parents be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of Allah\! With your death, the process of Prophethood, the revelation and heavenly messages have stopped and which had not stopped at the death of others \(prophets\)\. Your status with us \(members of your family\) is so special that our grief for having lost you has become a source of consolation \(to us\) as against the grief of all others; our grief for having lost you is also common so that all Muslims may share it equally\. If you had not commended endurance and prevented us from wailing, we would have produced tears abundantly\. Even then, the pain will not have subsided and this grief will not have ended\. They will have been too little an indication of our grief for you\. But this \(death\) is a matter that cannot be reversed nor is it possible to avoid\. May my father and mother die for you; do remember us with Allah and take care of us\.

**Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \(x\) Relating His Own Condition after the Prophet’s Migration till Their Meeting**

I began to follow the path adopted by the Prophet \(h\) and tread on the tracks of his remembrance till I reached al\-Arj\.

Sayyid ar\-Radi says the following: “Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s words “faata’u dhikrahu” constitute the highest forms of brevity and eloquence\. He means to say that he was being given news about the Prophet \(h\) from the commencement of his setting out till he reached this place, and he has expressed this notion in this wonderful expression\.”

Since the inception of Prophethood, the Prophet \(h\) remained in

Mecca for thirteen years\. For him, this period was one of the most severe oppression and destitution\. The unbelievers from the Quraish tribe had closed all the doors of livelihood against him, sparing no means to inflict hardship upon him, so much so that in order to put an end to his life, they began plotting with each other as to how to do so\. Forty of their dignitaries assembled in the hall of audience \(Dar an\-Nadwa\) for consultation and decided that one individual should be picked out from

<a id="page729"></a>every tribe, then they would jointly attack him\. In this way, Banu Hashim would not dare to face all the other tribes, and the matter would quiet down on the payment of blood money\. To give a practical shape to this scheme, these people lay in ambush near the house of the Prophet \(h\) on

the night of the first of Rabi’al\-Awwal\. As the Prophet \(h\) slept in his

bed, he was to be thus attacked\. On one hand, the preparation for killing him was complete\. On the other hand, Allah informed him of all the intrigues of the unbelieving tribesmen of Quraish, commanding him to let Ali \(x\) sleep in his bed while he himself had to immigrate to Medna\. The

Prophet \(h\) sent for Ali \(x\)\. Disclosing to him his plan, he said the following: “Ali \(x\)\! Lie in my bed\.” Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) inquired: “O Messenger of Allah\! Will your life be saved by my sleeping here?” The Prophet \(h\) said, “Yes\.” Hearing this, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) performed a prostration as a token of thanks\-giving and, exposing himself fully to the danger, lay on the Prophet’s bed while the Prophet \(h\)

departed\. The unbelieving tribesmen of Quraish were peeping and getting ready for the attack\. Abu Lahab said, “It is not proper to attack in the night because there are women and children also living in the house\. When the morning dawns, you should attack him, but keep watch during the night lest he should not move and go anywhere else\.” Consequently, they kept their eyes on the bed throughout the night and soon\. When dawn drew nigh, they proceeded stealthily\. Hearing the sound of their footsteps, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) removed the covering from his face and

stood up\. The tribesmen of Quraish gazed at him with disbelieving eyes as to whether it was an illusion or a fact\. After making sure that it was Ali, they inquired, “Where is Muhammad \(h\)?” Ali replied, “Did you

entrust him to me so that now you are asking me about him?\!” They had no reply\. Men ran to pursue him but found footprints only up to the cave \[of Hira\] in themountain of Thawr\. Beyond that, there were neither footprints nor any sign of hiding in the cave\. They came back bewildered while the Prophet \(h\), after staying in the cave for three days, left for

Medina\. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \(x\) passed these three days in Mecca, returned to the people their properties which they had entrusted the Prophet \(k\) to safeguard for them then set off towards Medna to join the Prophet \(h\)\. Up to al\-Arj, a place between Mecca and Medina, he kept getting news about the Prophet \(h\) and he maintained his anxious march till he finally met the Prophet \(h\) at Quba on the twelfth of Rabi’ al\-Awwal where the Prophet \(k\) was waiting for him, refusing to enter Medina without him \(al\-Tabari, Tafsir, Vol\. 9, pp\. 148\-151; Tarikh, Vol\.

**About Preparing Provisions for the next World, While Being in this World, and Performing Good Deeds Before Death**

Perform \(good\) deeds while you are still in the vastness of this life, while the books are open \(for recording your deeds\), repentance is allowed, the runner away \(from Allah\) is being called upon \(to revert\) and the sinner is being given hope \(of forgiveness\) before the \(light of\) action is put off, before time expires, life ends, the door of repentance is closed and the angels ascend to the sky\.

Therefore, a man should derive benefit from himself for himself, from the living for the dead, from the mortal for the immortal, and from the who departs for the one who stays\. A man should fear Allah while he is given a life to lead up to his death and is given time to act\. A man should control himself by the rein and hold it with its bridle\. Thus, by the rein he should prevent it from disobedience towards Allah, and by the bridle he should lead it towards obedience to Allah\.

Rude, low people and mean slaves\! They have been collected from all sides and picked up from every pack\. They need to be taught the tenets \(of Islam\), disciplined, instructed, trained, supervised and led by the hand\. They are neither Muhajirun nor Ansar, nor are those who made their dwellings in the abode \(in Medina\) and in belief\.

Look\! They have chosen for themselves one who is nearest of all to what they desire, while you have chosen one who is nearest to what you dislike\. You may certainly recall that the other day Abdullah ibn Qays \(Abu Musa al\-Ash\`ari\) was saying, “It is mischief; therefore, cut

<a id="page731"></a>away your bow\-string and sheathe your swords\.” If he was right \(in what he said\), then he was wrong in marching \(against us\) without being forced\. But if he was lying, then he should be viewed with suspicion\. Therefore, send \`Abdullah ibn Abbas to face \`Amr ibn al\-As\. Make use of these days and safeguard the borders of Islam\. Do you not see that your cities are being attacked and your prowess is being aimed at?

With them, right has returned to its status and wrong has left its place, so its tongue is severed from the root\. They have understood the religion attentively and carefully, not by mere heresy nor from relaters because those who relate knowledge are many, but those who absorb it are few\.

O Ibn Abbas\! Othman just wants to treat me like the water\-drawing camel so that I may go forward and backward with the bucket\. Once he sent word that I should go out, then he sent me word that I should return\. Now, again he sends me word that I should go out\.
